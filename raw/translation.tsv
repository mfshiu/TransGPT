31	294	1	39	zh-TW	那天我跟同學一起去博物館看一個展覽。當我們看完展覽，有兩位同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定去外面買東西吃，也許是在外面找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，外面正在下雨。我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟同學借一把傘。因為我有點高，又有點壯，就決定跟我ㄧ個同學Adam借把傘。他的體型跟我差不多。所以我從傘架中拿了一把傘。我跟我的老師，還有幾位同學一起去買麵包。我們回來的時候，陳小姐就看到我，並對我大叫。
32	294	1	40	en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed was actually Adam’s?

39	294	1	47	zh-TW	是的，我出博物館的時候，我是跟老師還有兩位同學一起的。我的老師也有提議要借我的傘，因為她的傘有點小，我並沒有拿。我不想要她被淋濕，然後也有兩位同學在旁邊。

41	294	1	49	zh-TW	也許是吧。
42	294	1	50	en-US	Is there any other evidence that you would like to ask the court to investigate for you?
43	294	1	51	zh-TW	我想要把傘還給陳小姐，但她不想拿；我也試圖想要道歉，但她根本不聽。我的老師跟同學也許可以證實，我說的是真的。
44	294	1	52	en-US	OK. Now, I would like to ask Ms. Chen about the detail of the incident on that day.Ms. Chen, could you please elaborate what happened on that day?
45	294	1	53	en-US	 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day, and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. However, when I came out form the museum, I found that my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff in the museum to help me find the umbrella, but I later saw putting my umbrella back. When I found that the umbrella he took was actually mine, I was actually very angry, and I asked him why he had taken my umbrella. It was raining at that time. How could he do that?
46	294	1	54	en-US	What color was the umbrella you took on that day, and is there any feature of the umbrella?
47	294	1	55	en-US	The umbrella I took on that day should have been blue, dark blue.

51	294	1	59	en-US	Actually, I did buy my umbrella at a 7-11. However, the button on my umbrella is a little broken; therefore, it is hard to buckle it up. In terms of this, I have especially talked about it when I made my record at the police station. And the umbrella, which the foreigner put back to the umbrella rack, also had this feature; therefore, it can be proven that the umbrella is mine.
52	294	1	60	en-US	If the defendant regrets and he is willing to apologize, would you like to forgive him? After all, what you missed was an umbrella.
53	294	1	61	en-US	It is not about what I missed was an umbrella. It is about one’s personality. If he had not taken the umbrella back on that day, I would be totally wet when I got home on that day. I don’t want to forgive him.

87	86	1	37	zh-TW	他對著我大吼，說我偷她雨傘。我試著跟他說我只是拿錯雨傘了，我根本沒偷她雨傘，我試著跟他道歉，但他不想聽我說。
88	86	1	38	en-US	So why did Ms. Chen say you stole her umbrella?
89	86	1	39	zh-TW	在當天我和一些同學到博物館裡面參觀一些展覽，當我們看完參展的物件之後，有個同學說他肚子餓，我們想說要找些東西吃，然後可能找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，我發現當時正在下雨。我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想說跟我ㄧ個同學借。因為我又高又壯，所以想說跟我ㄧ個叫亞當的同學借，他體型跟我比較相似。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，我和我的教授去買了一些麵包，和我的一些同學。當我們回來的時候，就是陳小姐對我大吼的時候。
90	86	1	40	en-US	do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed belonged to your classmate Adam?

97	86	1	47	zh-TW	對當時我走出博物館的時候，我的兩個同學還有老師都和我在一起。我老師甚至還想要借我雨傘，因為他的傘太小了所以我沒有跟他拿，我不想他被淋濕，還有其他兩位同學在場。
98	86	1	48	en-US	These three people can manage to come to the court right?
99	86	1	49	zh-TW	我想是吧
100	86	1	50	en-US	do you have any further evidence that want the court to investigate for you?
101	86	1	51	zh-TW	我試著想要把傘還給陳小姐，但他不願意；我試著要跟他到道歉，他也不接受。也許我的老師和同學可以證明我所言屬實。
102	86	1	52	en-US	 Okay, now I’m going to inquire Mr. Chen what happened on that day. Ms. Chen, can you state what happened on that day?
103	86	1	53	en-US	When I went to the Yingge ceramics museum, it’s raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack. But when I got out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff in the museum to look for my umbrella for me but then I saw that foreigner put my umbrella back.

According to this point, I did explain to the police station about the button on the umbrella. The umbrella that the foreigner returned had the same characteristics as the one I had.
110	86	1	60	en-US	Will you consider to accept the defendant’s apology if he’s willing to apologize to you? After all, it’s only an umbrella.
111	86	1	61	en-US	what do you mean “only” an umbrella? It’s something related to one’s basic ethics. If he didn’t return the umbrella on that day, he wants me to walk back in the pouring rain? I don’t want to accept his apology.
112	86	1	62	en-US	I understand. We will send the subpoena to the three witnesses on that day and asked them to come to the court to state the process. The next court day is set at 3pm on June 19th in 2014. The defendant and the three witnesses will have to come to the court. The defendant, is this date okay for you?

When I found out that the umbrella he took was mine, I angrily asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining? How could he do that?

1131	230	1	37	zh-TW	她對我大叫然後說我偷了她的傘。我試著告訴她我應該是拿錯了，我並沒有想要偷她的傘，我想要跟她道歉，但是她就是不聽我說話。
1132	230	1	38	en-US	So why did Miss Chen say you stole her umbrella?
1133	230	1	39	zh-TW	那天我跟我的一些同學去那邊看一個展覽。我們看完之後，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們就出去想找點吃的，或許就是吃個晚餐這樣吧。正當我要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了。我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟我一個同學借。因為我就是蠻高…蠻大…蠻胖的，所以我想跟我的朋友亞當借一隻傘，他跟我的體型比較像。所以我有從傘架拿了一隻傘，然後我就跟教授去買一些麵包，當我回來的時候陳小姐就開始對我叫。
1134	230	1	40	en-US	You said that the umbrella you borrowed at that time was Adam’s?
1135	230	1	41	zh-TW	對啊，我以為我拿的傘是亞當的，我沒有想要偷任何人的傘。
1136	230	1	42	en-US	Do you remember the umbrella you took…what color it looked like…the umbrella you took that day.
1137	230	1	43	zh-TW	我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，然後不是很新。
1138	230	1	44	en-US	Was the umbrella blue? All over the umbrella blue?
1139	230	1	45	zh-TW	嗯，回想起來是沒錯。
1140	230	1	46	en-US	Can anyone prove what you just said?
1141	230	1	47	zh-TW	有啊，我那時候走出博物館的時候，我的教授和我的兩個同學都和我在一起。我的教授還說她可以把傘借給我。但因為她的傘很小，我就沒有跟她借。我不想要她淋濕，而且我還有兩個同學在旁邊。
1142	230	1	48	en-US	 So the above three people can come to the court and prove that…prove what you just said here, right?
1143	230	1	49	zh-TW	我想是吧。
1144	230	1	50	en-US	Then what…are there any evidence you want the prosecutor to investigate?
1145	230	1	51	zh-TW	我試著想把傘還給陳小姐、跟她道歉，但她就是不聽我講話。或許我的教授跟兩個同學可以證明我講的話是正確…真的。
1146	230	1	52	en-US	OK, now I would like to ask Miss Chen what happened on that day. Miss Chen, could you please explain what happened on that day?
1147	230	1	53	en-US	On that day I went to Ying Ge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. When I went into the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack, and when I came out, my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff of the museum to look for it for me, and then I see this foreign coming back, wanting to put the umbrella back. When I found that the umbrella he was taking is mine, I was very angry and questioned him why he took my umbrella away. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How can a person have no such responsibility?
1148	230	1	54	en-US	So…what color was your umbrella on that day? What other traits did it have?
1149	230	1	55	en-US	The umbrella I brought on that day was blue. It was dark blue.
1150	230	1	56	en-US	Please look at the picture on page five on the investigation file. Please take a look at the picture. Is this umbrella yours?
1151	230	1	57	en-US	Yes, it was that umbrella.
1152	230	1	58	en-US	The umbrella on the photo was very ordinary. It’s like one you can buy in 7-11. How can you make sure it was yours?
1153	230	1	59	en-US	Indeed, I did buy my umbrella at 7-11. However there was a damage on the button part, so I know it was mine. I did explain about this when I filed for the case to the prosecutor. The umbrella which the foreigner put back also possesses that trait…so I know that the umbrella is mine…was mine.
1154	230	1	60	en-US	Then I would like to ask you, if the other…the defendant…is willing to regret and apologize, would you forgive him? Because it was just an umbrella.
1155	230	1	61	en-US	What do you mean by it was just an umbrella? It is a matter of whether he cares for others or not. If he didn’t take the umbrella back, do you want me to go out when it was raining? I don’t want to forgive him.
1156	230	1	62	en-US	I understand. So I will subpoena the three people he mentioned to the court and ask them to prove what he said was right. The next court will be set at 3 PM, June 19th, 2014. Plantiff, defendant, and the three witnesses should be here. Defendant, is the date OK with you?
1157	230	1	63	zh-TW	好的，我會到。

1159	230	1	65	en-US	No, I don’t think I’m coming. I need to take that day off if I would like to come.
1160	230	1	66	en-US	I understand. Then the procedure ends here today. Please leave the court after you sign for the record.

1271	246	1	61	en-US	What do you mean by “it’s only an umbrella.” If he didn’t return it to me that day, I would have to go home in the rain. I am not willing to forgive him.

1307	254	1	39	zh-TW	那天，我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館參展看展啊。看完展覽後，其中有兩個同學就說他們餓了。所以我們就決定出去找找食物，找個能吃晚餐的地方。一離開博物館的時候，就下雨了。因為我沒有帶雨傘，所以我就決定借我同學的傘。因為我比較高壯一點，所以我就決定借我同學亞當的傘，因為他的體型跟我很像。所以我就從傘架拿出一個傘，然後和我的教授和兩個朋友一起去買麵包。當我們這群人回到博物館後，陳小姐就對我大喊。
1308	254	1	40	en-US	 So do you mean that at that time, the umbrella that you borrowed was…you borrowed it from Adam?

But when I came out of the museum, my umbrella was gone. I asked one of the workers in the museum to help me find the umbrella, and I saw this young man taking my umbrella at that time. When I saw my umbrella on his hand, I was very, very furious, and I questioned him loudly why he would want to take my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining hard at that time? Did he have any conscience?
1322	254	1	54	en-US	Then may I ask you that what color was your umbrella that you brought that day? Did it have any special symbols?

1328	254	1	60	en-US	Then, now the defendant apologized to you…is willing to apologize to you and showed some regrets, are you willing to forgive the defendant? Because it’s just….he accidentally took your umbrella.
1329	254	1	61	en-US	 Hey, what do you mean by saying that it was just an umbrella? It shows that this person has no conscience. I assume that if that person didn’t return my umbrella back to me on that day, then I would just end up being all wet. I will not forgive the defendant.

Later I will ask the accuser what happened about the incident to fully understand this case. Do both parties understand?
2864	427	1	30	zh-TW	我了解。

2869	427	1	35	zh-TW	是的，当我把雨伞还回去的时候，陈小姐在那里。
2870	427	1	36	en-US	What happened at that time?
2871	427	1	37	zh-TW	她当时对着我大叫，说我偷了她的伞，我于是向她解释我可能是拿错了伞，并没有偷。我当时也试图给它道歉，但她并不接受。
2872	427	1	38	en-US	Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
2873	427	1	39	zh-TW	那天我和同学去了莺歌陶瓷博物馆去看一个展览，看完展品之后，有同学说很饿想去吃东西，于是我们想去找一个吃东西的地方，和找个地方吃晚饭。当我离开博物馆之后，我看到下雨了，但是我并没有带伞，于是我就想说借同学的伞。因为我身材高大，所以我想借亚当的雨伞，因为他身材和我差不多。我从架子上拿了一把雨伞，然后就给教授和同学买面包，当我回来的时候，就发现陈小姐对我大喊大叫。
2874	427	1	40	en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed is from your classmate Adam?
2875	427	1	41	zh-TW	是的，我当时觉得自己拿的是亚当的雨伞，我并没有被想要偷任何人的雨伞。
2876	427	1	42	en-US	Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you borrowed that day?
2877	427	1	43	zh-TW	我只记得雨伞的颜色。它是蓝色的，然后并不是崭新的。
2878	427	1	44	en-US	Is the umbrella all blue?
2879	427	1	45	zh-TW	在我的印象当中，那个伞是蓝色的。
2880	427	1	46	en-US	Can anyone verify what your said?
2881	427	1	47	zh-TW	是的，当我离开博物馆的时候，我和一个教授和两个同学一起。教授当时甚至要借给我她自己的伞。因为她的伞太小了，我不想身上淋湿，所以没要她的伞，当时两个同学也在那里。
2882	427	1	48	en-US	Do you mean that all three of them can be present at the court and verify what you said, am I right?
2883	427	1	49	zh-TW	我想应该是这样。
2884	427	1	50	en-US	Is there any evidence you want the police to help investigate for you?
2885	427	1	51	zh-TW	我试图把伞归还给陈小姐，但她不要，我也试图给她道歉，但她也不接受，也许我的教授和同学能证实我说的是真的吧。
2886	427	1	52	en-US	OK, let me ask you a few questions on what happened about the incident?Miss Chen, can you tell us what happened at that time on this incident?
2887	427	1	53	en-US	It was raining when I was going to the Yingge Ceramics Museum. And I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I was about to leave the museum, the umbrella was gone. I asked the staff from the museum to help me find the umbrella and I found that this foreigner returned the umbrella. I was quite angry the umbrella he returned was exactly the one that I have. I asked him why did he take my umbrella. How could he be so ethically irresponsible?
2888	427	1	54	en-US	Miss Chen, what’s the color of your umbrella? Are there any characteristics of your umbrella?
2889	427	1	55	en-US	The umbrella I took that day was blue, dark blue I guess.

2891	427	1	57	en-US	Yes, it belongs to me.
2892	427	1	58	en-US	The umbrella on the photo was quite ordinary that can even be bought everywhere like 711. How can you be so sure that the umbrella on the photo is yours?
2893	427	1	59	en-US	It is indeed bought at a 711-convenience store. But my umbrella has some problems with its buttons and it can’t be fixed. I explained to the police about this matter and the umbrella the foreigner returned on the rack also has problems with its buttons. So I think it’s exactly the same umbrella.
2894	427	1	60	en-US	Would you forgive him after he apologizes to you and show his regrets? After all it’s only an umbrella.
2895	427	1	61	en-US	What do you mean by just an umbrella. It’s a matter about moral qualities. If he did not return my umbrella, I would go in the rain and go home. I would not forgive him.
2896	427	1	62	en-US	Ok, I understand. This court will subpoena three witnesses to the court. And the next proceeding will be at 3pm, June 25th, 2018. And the three witnesses shall be at the court for the proceeding. Are you ok with this date?

2898	427	1	64	en-US	Miss Chen, for the next proceeding, you can either come or not because the next proceeding is mainly to ask questions to the professors and students. It’s okay for you to come to the court.
2899	427	1	65	en-US	No, I will not be present at the next proceeding because I have to ask for a leave permit.

4153	81	3	44	zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了，我有居留證而且我也喜歡這裡，目前我對在台灣的生活很滿意，特別是我希望我的女兒可以看到他的父母。我要說的是目前我和我太太正在打離婚官司，我們並不希望彼此切斷與女兒的聯繫。在我們離婚官司進行中，我定期會繼我們女兒的照面給太太看，我甚至還安排時間讓我們三個有時兼聚一聚。

4172	81	3	63	en-US	where is the child right now?
4173	81	3	64	en-US	my daughter is at my husband’s place.
4174	81	3	65	en-US	do you have any agreement between you two? Why did the daughter stay with you in the first place and then move to your husband’s place?
4175	81	3	66	en-US	The place I just moved out is smaller and my husband’s bigger. In terms of the environment, my husband’s place is better so I leave the daughter to him.
4176	81	3	67	en-US	If the objective circumstances don’t change, I mean your living situations, your daughter still better stays at your husband’s place? Why do you want to win the child rearing right?
4177	81	3	68	en-US	It took me ten months to get the child. I couldn’t stand that I cannot see her any more. And my husband is a Canadian and he doesn’t have a full-time job. He may go back to Canada any time. Thus, it means I cannot see my daughter any more. That’s why I’m asking the custody of my daughter.
4178	81	3	69	en-US	In terms of your financial status, can you elaborate how would you raise your daughter?
4179	81	3	70	en-US	We still have the divorcing case going. I hope after the case of divorce I can live where my husband’s living now, the house. Thus in terms of environment, the house is better for my daughter. As to my financial status, I’ve offered the court a list of my asset. Besides, I have a regular job. I earn at least 40000 a month. I think I have the right to rear my daughter.
4180	81	3	71	en-US	So what’s the process going of your divorcing case? Do you know around what time the case will be settled?
4181	81	3	72	en-US	I’m not quite sure. This Friday we will go to the court again. I will talk to the judge of the case that we hope to see the result faster.
4182	81	3	73	en-US	Let’s say we will arrange social workers to visit both the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s houses and we will take into account the interactions of both sides with the child. The court will consider the report after the visit and make the best decision for the daughter. However, before that, will both sides consider the shared custody? The sahred custody means that the daughter will stay sometimes at the mother’s place and sometimes at father’s place.
4183	81	3	74	zh-TW	對我個人而言我是不希望共同撫養權，因為我的女兒還太小，他才八個月大，我不希望她在我與太太之間流轉。對於這樣年紀小的孩子來說，我覺得這樣太累，一下子搬到母親的地方、一下子換到我的地方。
4184	81	3	75	en-US	At this point, I agree with my husband. The daughter is too little. She shouldn’t and it’s not suitable in this case.
4185	81	3	76	en-US	So we all arrange the visit of social workers first. After we see the report, we will arrange the next court day to keep the right for both parties to state their rights.

4217	89	3	36	zh-TW	我希望可以把所有撫養權都判給我，因為我很關心他。第一我老婆已經不再跟我們一起住了，我想要看著我的女兒長大，而且我還聽說我的老婆跟別的男人同居，如果真的是這樣的話我懷疑我老婆沒有能力養活這孩子，所以我要爭取全部的撫養權。
4218	89	3	37	en-US	what you mean is because your wife have divorce case with you, so she is not live with you,right? and you doubt that she lives with other man. it is because of this situation, you don’t want to give your children to her.

4224	89	3	43	en-US	So other than salary, will you bring your daughter to Canada after you got the custody, and you will never come back? I mention this point is that even if you got the sole custody, your wife still have visitation right. If you take your daughter back to Canada, it means that you cut the tie with your daughter and her mother. So what do you think?
4225	89	3	44	zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了。我已經有居留證，而且我很喜歡這個地方。目前還沒有任何打算離開台灣的計畫。而且我也覺得我的女兒也希望可以見到父母。我想說的是即使我現在在和我老婆打離婚官司，我也沒有打算切斷她和女兒之間的聯繫。在我們打離婚官司的同時，我也常常寄我們女兒的照片給她。我甚至和她達成協議，有時候可以大家一起出來聚聚。
4226	89	3	45	en-US	So you mean that you are not going back to Canada recently, right?
4227	89	3	46	zh-TW	沒有...如果我要回加拿大的話是因為我媽媽又老又生病了。然而，就算我回去加拿大了，我也不會在那裡久留。我也不會考慮把我的女兒帶回去加拿大。

4247	89	3	66	en-US	After I move out, the  place where we were live is a little bit smaller than my husband’s house. So I think the environment is better for the children, so I give my daughter to my husband.
4248	89	3	67	en-US	So if objective condition is not change, you still don’t have….better…so why do you want to get custody of your daughter.

4255	89	3	74	zh-TW	我個人來說，我不太喜歡這個提議，因為我的女兒還太小，他也只有八個月大而已。我不想要讓他經歷我跟我老婆這段破碎的關係。對於年紀這麼小的女兒來說，他應該會覺得突然跟爸爸或是媽媽住是一件很奇怪的事情。
4256	89	3	75	en-US	I agree my husband at this point. my daughter is too small, she is not okay for this kind of resolution.

4296	97	3	43	en-US	And I also want to know if you get the custody of your child, will you go back to Canada and no longer come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask this question is that even you get the custody; your wife still had the visitation right. If you take your child back to your country, it means that you cut the tie between them. What’s your opinion about this?
4297	97	3	44	zh-TW	我已經在台灣住五年了 我有居留證而且我也喜歡這個地方 目前我沒有離開台灣的計畫 而且我認為我女兒有見到父母雙方的權利 我想強調的是 雖然我跟我太太正在辦離婚 可是我完全沒有要切斷他跟我女兒的關係 在打離婚官司的過程中 我也都會固定傳女兒照片給我老婆 我還安排出去的機會讓她跟女兒有相處的時間

4302	97	3	49	en-US	When did you file the case of divorce?
4303	97	3	50	en-US	About two months ago
4304	97	3	51	en-US	That is, long before you sued for divorce, you don’t lived together.

4306	97	3	53	en-US	So who do you live with now?

4318	97	3	65	en-US	Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter originally lived you, but now with him?
4319	97	3	66	en-US	The place I live now is smaller, and the original house I lived with my husband is bigger. Considering about the environment, I think the old house is better for my daughter, so I took her back to live with my husband.
4320	97	3	67	en-US	So considering about the objective circumstance, I mean the space of your house, it’s still worse for her, isn’t it? Then why would you want the custody of your daughter?
4321	97	3	68	en-US	Come on, I borne her! How would you think I don’t want to see her in the future? Also my husband is a Canadian, and his job is Taiwan is not stable so he may go back to Canada anytime. In that case, doesn’t that mean I can see my daughter anymore? So I want to have the custody of my daughter.
4322	97	3	69	en-US	Can you tell me how would bring up your child? With your financial status.
4323	97	3	70	en-US	So far, we are still dealing with the divorcing case. I want to fight for the right to live in the house which my husband lives now, after our divorce. So consider about the environmental issue, the house will suit my daughter a lot. As for my financial status, I have given the court an asset list. Also, I have a regular income; it’s about 40000 per month. So I think I have the ability to take care of my daughter.
4324	97	3	71	en-US	So how your divorcing case is goes now? Do you know when will the court’s decision come out?
4325	97	3	72	en-US	I am not very sure about that. We will go to the court this Friday. I will ask the judge of our divorcing case to make the decision as soon.

The shared custody goes like that, your daughter will live with you sometime, and the other time lives with your husband.
4327	97	3	74	zh-TW	我個人不支持這個 因為我女兒還在小了 他只有八個月大耶 我不想要她一直在我跟我老婆之間一直改變環境 對一個這麼小的小孩來說 他會混淆吧 如果他真得要這樣跟我住一段時間又跟她住一段時間

4361	105	3	36	zh-TW	我之所以希望能得到全部的撫養權有兩個原因。首先，我老婆不再與我們住在一起了，我希望能看著我小孩長大。再來，我聽說我老婆現在跟別的男人住在一起，如果真的是那樣的話，我很懷疑我女兒能得到全然的照顧。因此我希望擁有全部的撫養權。
4362	105	3	37	en-US	You mean you are no longer live together though you are under the case of divorce? Also, you doubt that she is living together with another man. I that circumstances, you don’t want to share the custody with your wife?
4363	105	3	38	zh-TW	是的，這是我主要考慮的一些因素。
4364	105	3	39	en-US	Otherwise, concerning your financial status, if you get the custody of your daughter, how would you raise your child?
4365	105	3	40	zh-TW	雖然我現在沒有正職工作是真的，但是我有好幾份兼職工作讓我有固定的收入。我相信這足夠讓我和我女兒過活。
4366	105	3	41	en-US	You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Can you promise that you have regular income?
4367	105	3	42	zh-TW	我平均會有四到五個兼職，總共來說我大概會有五萬的收入。有時如果有另外的案子我可以有更多的收入。
4368	105	3	43	en-US	I have a further question, is that possible to bring your child to Canada and no more back to Taiwan after you get the custody? The reason why I ask so because even you get sole custody, your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring your child back to Canada, you are separating your wife and child. What’s your idea to this point?
4369	105	3	44	zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年，我有居留證，而且我也愛這個地方。目前我沒有要離開台灣。另外我也覺得我的女兒有權利可以看到她的爸爸媽媽。雖然我和我老婆正在打離婚官司，我絕對沒有意圖想阻止我女兒與老婆之間的聯繫。在我跟我老婆打離婚官司的過程中，我仍會定期傳女兒的照片給她。我也有鼓勵她多與我們相處。
4370	105	3	45	en-US	So recently you don’t plan to back to Canada?
4371	105	3	46	zh-TW	我有可能會回去加拿大因為我媽媽年老且生病。但就算我回去我也不會待很久。我甚至不會想帶我女兒一起回加拿大。
4372	105	3	47	en-US	Okay I have some question to ask the opposite position. Aren’t you living with your husband?
4373	105	3	48	en-US	No, we haven’t lived together for six months.
4374	105	3	49	en-US	When did you file the divorce suit?
4375	105	3	50	en-US	It might be two months ago.
4376	105	3	51	en-US	So you didn’t live together before you file the lawsuit, right?.
4377	105	3	52	en-US	Yes.
4378	105	3	53	en-US	So what’s your living situation, I mean, who do you live together with?
4379	105	3	54	en-US	I live with my son of my first marriage.
4380	105	3	55	en-US	The first marriage? What time is the marriage with plaintiff?
4381	105	3	56	en-US	He is the second husband.

4386	105	3	61	en-US	When you moved out the house, who was your daughter with?
4387	105	3	62	en-US	Because my daughter was only two months old when I was moving out. She needed my care so she was with me.
4388	105	3	63	en-US	Where is daughter with?
4389	105	3	64	en-US	My daughter is with my husband now.
4390	105	3	65	en-US	Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter was first with you and now she is with your husband?
4391	105	3	66	en-US	The place where I am living is smaller than the house when I lived with my husband. I think, environmentally, it is good for my daughter to live with my husband.
4392	105	3	67	en-US	So in the objective circumstances, if it isn’t changed, it isn’t good for your daughter to live with you. Why you still want the custody of your daughter?
4393	105	3	68	en-US	I had ten months pregnant to give birth to her. She is my child. And my husband is a Canadian, also he doesn’t have the full-time job, he might go back to Canada any time. If so, I would not see my daughter any more. So I want to be granted with the custody.
4394	105	3	69	en-US	To your financial status, can you clarify how you raise your daughter?
4395	105	3	70	en-US	We are under the case of divorce. I hope that I can get the right to live in the house which my husband is living in after divorcing. That house is good for my daughter to grow.

4397	105	3	72	en-US	I’m not sure. We will have the court date this Friday. I want to inform the judge of the divorce case…………
4398	105	3	73	en-US	Okay, I will arrange the social worker to visit both of you. And make evaluations separately between both of you and your daughter. It will be the reference to the court decision of the custody. Before that, will you want to share the custody? To the definition of shared custody, it means, in a period of time, the child is with father, then, in another period of time, the child is with mother.
4399	105	3	74	zh-TW	個人來說，我沒有很喜歡這個主意，我女兒還太小。她才八個月大，我不想要她年紀那麼小就經歷那麼多變動。對這麼小的小孩而言，一下跟爸爸住一下跟媽媽住可能會讓她覺得困惑。
4400	105	3	75	en-US	In that point, I agree with my husband. It’s too young to my daughter.
4401	105	3	76	en-US	Okay I get it. I will arrange the visit of social worker. After the evaluation, we will arrange another court date to make opportunities that both parties can state. Is that okay with you?

4505	121	3	36	zh-TW	我希望我可以得到我子女全部的扶養權，就以下這幾點。首先，我妻子已經沒有再跟我們住在一起了，我希望我可以陪伴著我孩子成長。此外，我還知道我太太跟其他男人住在一起，如果真是如此，我很懷疑她是否真能給我們的孩子最好的照顧。因此，我希望可以得到全部的扶養權。
4506	121	3	37	en-US	Do you mean that your wife is no longer live with you even if she is still under the divorcing case? Moreover, you doubt that she is living with another man now? It is because under such circumstance that you do not want her to take care of your child?

4512	121	3	43	en-US	Moreover, I want to know that if you have the right to raise children; will you take your child back to Canada and you will not come back ever again? I would ask this question is because even if you do get the right to raise your children, your wife may still have the visitation right for your child.

4536	121	3	67	en-US	If the objective circumstance does not change, I mean that you sill live in the smaller house, I don’t think it will be good for your child. Why do you want to fight for the rearing right?

He might go back to Canada because he even does not have a full-time job in Taiwan. In that case, I might not see my daughter ever again. As a result, I want to fight for the rearing right of my daughter.

4543	121	3	74	zh-TW	就個人來講，我不太喜歡這種方式因為我女兒還很小，她才八個月大欸，我不想讓她經歷我和太太之間的變動，對這麼小的孩子來說，這會讓她很混亂，為什麼有時候和爸爸在一起，有時才能見媽媽呢?

4573	129	3	32	en-US	Today I am here; my real purpose is to understand what’s your status in this child rearing. Also, I want to know why both of you think you have the right to rear this child. Please focus on this point clearly. Besides, I know you are under the procedure of the case of divorce. I hope you can avoid the verbal attacking, do you understand?
4574	129	3	33	zh-TW	我瞭解。
4575	129	3	34	en-US	Yes, I do.
4576	129	3	35	en-US	So now, I will ask some question for plaintiff. Why you want to fight for the right for rearing your child? As I know, you don’t have the fall-time job in Taiwan now. You are a foreigner. Why do you think you are more proper than the defense that you can rear your child?
4577	129	3	36	zh-TW	我希望能把我的孩子判給我是因為有一些考慮的。第一點，我的老婆沒有跟我們住在一起，我想在那看著我女兒長大。此外我聽說我老婆跟別人住。如果那是真的的話，我非常懷疑她是否有能力給們的女兒最好的照顧。因此我希望能得到全部的撫養權。
4578	129	3	37	en-US	You mean that your wife is under the procedure of a divorce case and she doesn’t live with you. Is that right? Also, you suspected that she is living with other man. Are those concerns that you think you don’t want your daughter to live with your wife?
4579	129	3	38	zh-TW	沒錯，那些是我主要的顧慮。
4580	129	3	39	en-US	As to your financial status, if you got the custody of your daughter, how can you raise her up?
4581	129	3	40	zh-TW	我現在沒有全職工作是真的。但是我有幾分臨時工可以讓我有固定的收入，我認為我的收入足夠讓我和我的女兒生活。
4582	129	3	41	en-US	You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because those jobs are part-time jobs, can you calculate how much can you earn each month?
4583	129	3	42	zh-TW	我平均大約有四到五個兼職。大約可以讓我賺到一萬五千元台幣每個月。有時候如果我有新的工作的話我會有新的收入。
4584	129	3	43	en-US	I have another question. If you have the custody of your daughter, will you bring her to Canada and never come back? The reason why I ask you that question is because although you have the custody of your daughter, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter to your country that means you will violate the right of your wife to visit your daughter. What’s your point about this case?
4585	129	3	44	zh-TW	我在台灣已經待了有五年了，我有居留證而且我喜歡這個地方。到目前為止我並沒有任何計畫打算離開台灣。而且我確信我的女兒有權力見到她的父母。在這裡我要強調的是:雖然我和我的老婆正在打離婚官司，但是我絕對不會切斷她們的關係。在我們打離婚官司的程序中，我時常會寄我們女兒的照片給我老婆看。我也時常安排出去，我們三個一起出遊。
4586	129	3	45	en-US	You mean that recently you will not return to your mother country, is that right?
4587	129	3	46	zh-TW	不，有可能因為我的媽媽已經年老了也生病了。即使我回去但我也不會待太久，我甚至不會考慮把我女兒一起帶去。
4588	129	3	47	en-US	so now, I will ask some question for other party. You don’t live with your husband, right?
4589	129	3	48	en-US	Yes, we have separated for six months.
4590	129	3	49	en-US	When did you have the divorce case?
4591	129	3	50	en-US	About two months ago.
4592	129	3	51	en-US	Before you have the case, you didn’t live together.
4593	129	3	52	en-US	Yes.
4594	129	3	53	en-US	Who do you live with?
4595	129	3	54	en-US	I bring my son of my first marriage together.
4596	129	3	55	en-US	Your first marriage? What is your marriage time with the plaintiff?
4597	129	3	56	en-US	He is my second husband.
4598	129	3	57	en-US	So now, we are talking about the custody of the daughter which is you and your second husband have. 
4599	129	3	58	en-US	Yes.

4602	129	3	61	en-US	After you leave your home, who live with your daughter?
4603	129	3	62	en-US	Because when I leave my home, my daughter was only two months so I worked her out in order to take care of her.
4604	129	3	63	en-US	Where is your daughter now?
4605	129	3	64	en-US	My daughter is in my husband’s house.
4606	129	3	65	en-US	Do you have any agreement that your daughter live with you first and later she lives with your husband?
4607	129	3	66	en-US	After I left my house, I live in a small house, but the original one is bigger. According to the environment, my husband’s house is better for my child.
4608	129	3	67	en-US	If the objective circumstance that your house is not good enough, your daughter lives with your husband is a better choice, isn’t that right? Why you want to own the custody of your daughter?
4609	129	3	68	en-US	I spent ten months to have my daughter. How can I endure that I cannot see her in the future? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian and he doesn’t have a full-time job. Also, he may leave Taiwan to Canada. As a result, I may not see my daughter in the future. So I hope I can fight for the custody of my daughter. 
4610	129	3	69	en-US	How can you afford the expense for your daughter in your financial status?
4611	129	3	70	en-US	Now, we are still under the procedure of divorce case. I want to have the right to live in my husband’s house after the divorce. According to the environment, my husband’s house is suitable for my daughter to grow. As to my financial status, I have provided an asset list to the court. Besides, I have a regular full-time job. I earn about forty thousand NT dollars a month. I think I have the ability to take care of my daughter.
4612	129	3	71	en-US	How’s your divorce case? When is the result be made about time?
4613	129	3	72	en-US	I am not sure. This Friday we will have a court again. I will inform the judge in that court to make the decision earlier.
4614	129	3	73	en-US	Ok, the court will have social workers to visit both of you, you and your husband. And make the evaluation to the situation that you and your husband’s accompanying your daughter. We will see the evaluation to decide the best choice for your daughter. So before the evaluation, I want to ask both of you that can you share the custody of your daughter? What is share custody is that your daughter will live with your husband for a period of time and later she will leave with you.
4615	129	3	74	zh-TW	基本上我不太贊同這個決議，因為我的女兒太小了，她才八個月大。我不想要她在我和我老婆之間換來換去。以我女兒現在的年紀來講，如果她一下子跟她媽媽住、一下子跟她爸爸住，這會讓她搞混。
4616	129	3	75	en-US	To that point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young, so it’s not proper and should not use that method.
4617	129	3	76	en-US	Ok, now we arrange the schedule of social worker first. After they make a report, we will arrange the court day to give you the opportunity to state yourself, is that ok?
4618	129	3	77	zh-TW	OK 沒問題。

4643	137	3	30	en-US	Yes, I did
4644	137	3	31	zh-TW	我也有請律師
4645	137	3	32	en-US	Today, I want to understand the viewpoints of child rearing for both sides. The court will also figure out why both sides want the right to raise child. Please make more statements at this point, OK? In addition to this case, the court also knew that you were undergoing the divorce case. Both sides should avoid verbal attack on the court. Do you fully understand?
4646	137	3	33	zh-TW	是的，我了解
4647	137	3	34	en-US	I understand.
4648	137	3	35	en-US	Explain why you urged to get child rearing right. So far you don’t have the full time job in Taiwan. Basically, you are the foreigner. In this case, why did you think you have the better right to get this?
4649	137	3	36	zh-TW	我希望能把所有的撫養權判給我，因為有兩個原因，首先，我太太沒有和我們住在一起，我希望能看到我女兒在這邊長大。此外，我聽到消息說我老婆和別的男人住在一起，如果情況真的如此，那我懷疑我女兒能否得到最完善的照顧，因此，我希望能得到所有的撫養權。
4650	137	3	37	en-US	In other words, your wife lived with another man when you had the divorce case. Besides, you also have the doubt she lives with another man. Under this circumstance, you are not willing to give the sole custody to her.
4651	137	3	38	zh-TW	是的，這些就是我主要的考量
4652	137	3	39	en-US	Concerning about the financial status, if you get the custody, what will you do?
4653	137	3	40	zh-TW	的確，我現在沒有拿到一個全職工作，但是我有幾份兼職的工作，可以讓我保持一個穩定的收入，我相信這個金錢來源，足夠讓我養活我們

4655	137	3	42	zh-TW	我大概有四到五份兼職工作，全部總計每個月大概可以有五萬的收入，如果有接到新的企劃，說不定能賺更多。
4656	137	3	43	en-US	So, another question would be that if you get the sole custody with your daughter, would you bring her to Canada and stay in Canada forever and would not come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask this question is that even though you get the custody, your wife still has the visitation right to see your daughter. If you bring your daughter to Canada, it will become that you isolate your daughter from your wife. At this point, what is your opinion?
4657	137	3	44	zh-TW	我已在台灣待了四五年，我有居留證也喜歡這個地方，目前為止，我沒有任何計畫打算離開台灣。我認為我女兒有權可以看到我們雙方，我想強調的是即便我和我老婆在打離婚官司，但沒有打算切斷她們母女之間的關係。在整個離婚訴訟中，我也常寄女兒的圖片給我妻子看，我甚至還計畫讓她和女兒一起出遊，讓他多看看我們的女兒
4658	137	3	45	en-US	What you mean is that you have no intention to come back to Canada, Right?
4659	137	3	46	zh-TW	有可能回加拿大也可能是因為我母親又老又病，所以我必須得回去，就算我回去，也不會待太久，我不會考慮帶我女兒回去的可能。

4662	137	3	49	en-US	When did you file the divorce case?

4664	137	3	51	en-US	 That is to say is that before you file the case, you did not live together, right?
4665	137	3	52	en-US	Yes
4666	137	3	53	en-US	So, let me ask you about your living status. I mean whom do you live with?

4677	137	3	64	en-US	My daughter lives with my husband.
4678	137	3	65	en-US	Is there any agreement between you and him? Originally, your daughter lives with you. Why did your daughter live with him now?
4679	137	3	66	en-US	The place I live so far is small. Originally, our house was much bigger.Concerning for the environment, I think my husband’s house is better. I get my daughter to him.
4680	137	3	67	en-US	 For the objective circumstance, what I mean is that if your place has no change, it would be not good for your daughter. Why did you want to get the custody?
4681	137	3	68	en-US	She is my daughter with hard effort. How could I live without her? Besides, my husband is Canadian and his job is not stable. He has high possibility of coming back to Canada. In this way, I may not see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I want to get the custody.
4682	137	3	69	en-US	For your finical status, could you explain how you afford your daughter’s raising fee?
4683	137	3	70	en-US	So far we are in the progress of divorce case. I want to ask where my husband lives so far. For the finical status, I think that house will be suitable for my daughter. I have provided a piece of asset for the court. In addition to that, I have stable job which I can get forty thousand each month. I think I am able to raise my daughter.
4684	137	3	71	en-US	I want to the progress of your divorce case. Do you know when will the court make the judge or which day they will give answer?
4685	137	3	72	en-US	I am not sure about that. We have to go to the court this Friday. I will send my concern to judge who is undergoing our case.
4686	137	3	73	en-US	OK, the court will send social workers to both sides to see our status. They will make the evaluation about how good is daughter to one side. The court will examine the report to make the decision which one is good to your daughter. Before that, will you consider the shared custody for both sides? The shared custody means that the daughter lives with father sometimes. For another time, she will live with mother.
4687	137	3	74	zh-TW	我個人不太喜歡這樣的建議，因為我們女兒還小，他現在只有八個月大，我不希望她經歷在父母之間的轉換。對這麼小的兒童而言，一下子和爸爸住，一下又跟媽媽住，這對他們是困擾混淆的

4726	145	3	41	en-US	Do you mention that you have several part-time jobs? Because they’re all part-time jobs, so can you promise that how much you will receive as regular income per month?
4727	145	3	42	zh-TW	我平均會打四到五個工。大概總收入是五萬元。有時候如果我接到新的工作，我就會有更多的收入。
4728	145	3	43	en-US	Another question is that would you bring your daughter back to Canada if you get the custody. The reason why I’m asking this question is that even if you receive the custody, but your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada that means you use another way to separate your daughter and your wife and that’s violated the visitation right. What do you have to say upon this point?
4729	145	3	44	zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了。我已經拿到居留證了而且我也很喜歡這個地方。至今我還沒有要離開台灣。尤其我也認為我的女兒應該要有權力可以時常看到她的雙親。我想要強調的是儘管我們現在正在打離婚訴訟，但我並沒有想要把她和我太太拆散的意思。在我們打離婚官司的期間我常常有寄女兒的照片給她啊。我甚至有安排她們一起出去讓她們有更多的機會相處。
4730	145	3	45	en-US	Do you mean that you don’t have the intention to go back to Canada recently?
4731	145	3	46	zh-TW	 不會，我只是可能會因為我母親年長而且生病的原因回去而已。就算我回去了我也不會待太久。我更不會考慮說會把女兒帶過去。
4732	145	3	47	en-US	 Then I would like to ask a few questions to the other party. Are you living with your husband now or not?
4733	145	3	48	en-US	Yes. We separated for about six month.
4734	145	3	49	en-US	When did you raise the divorce case?
4735	145	3	50	en-US	Maybe about two month ago.
4736	145	3	51	en-US	That means before you filed the divorce case you two hadn’t lived together, right?
4737	145	3	52	en-US	Yes.
4738	145	3	53	en-US	Now do you live with someone?
4739	145	3	54	en-US	I live with my son and is from my ex-husband.
4740	145	3	55	en-US	You said that your son belongs to your first husband, so what is(how about) this time?
4741	145	3	56	en-US	He is my second husband.
4742	145	3	57	en-US	So let me clarify this. The daughter is the children(child) between you and your second husband?
4743	145	3	58	en-US	Yes.
4744	145	3	59	en-US	How old is your son and how old is your daughter?
4745	145	3	60	en-US	My son is seven years old and mu daughter is just eight months.
4746	145	3	61	en-US	When you went out to live, whom did your daughter stay with?
4747	145	3	62	en-US	When I lived out, my daughter is just two months, so my daughter needs a lot of care, so she lived with me at that time.
4748	145	3	63	en-US	Now, who have(has) the child now?
4749	145	3	64	en-US	She lives with my husband now.
4750	145	3	65	en-US	Do you have any agreement? Why did your daughter live with you and now don’t(doesn’t) and lives with your husband now?
4751	145	3	66	en-US	I moved to a smaller place and my husband’s home is bigger, so my daughter stays with him. It’s a more appropriate environment for my daughter, so I leave my daughter to him.
4752	145	3	67	en-US	If the objective circumstances, I mean the living environment, don’t change, it’s still not good for your daughter, right? Then why would you like to file for the custody?
4753	145	3	68	en-US	I was pregnant for totally ten months and have her. How could I leave her alone? In addition, my husband is a Canadian. He doesn’t have a regular job. He doesn’t have fixed income. And maybe one day he will go back to Canada. If that’s the case, maybe I will never see my daughter. Therefore I would like to receive my daughter’s custody.
4754	145	3	69	en-US	Can you explain further on the point of financial status to proof that you can raise your daughter?
4755	145	3	70	en-US	Now we’re still on the divorce case. I hope the result would be that my daughter will still live at the place that my husband lives in now. That would be a really good place for my daughter to grow up. As for my personal financial status, I have provide(d) the court my asset list. In addition I have a regular income per month. Every month I receive over 40,000 dollars. I think I have the ability to raise my daughter.
4756	145	3	71	en-US	So how’s your divorce case? How does the process go? Is there a set time that the result will come out?
4757	145	3	72	en-US	I’m not sure. We will have the divorce court this Friday. I hope I can state my hope to that judge that I want the result to come out soon.
4758	145	3	73	en-US	Then we will sent(send) social workers to both of your parties. Besides, we will evaluate how you two take care of your child. We will consider their report and see who will be more appropriate to raise the child. Before that, I would like to ask both of you, do you have the will to have shared custody. The shared custody means that the child lives with one of the parent for a period of time and lives with the other for another period of time.
4759	145	3	74	zh-TW	我個人不是很贊成因為我們的孩子還很小。她只有八個月大而已欸，我不想要她一直經歷環境上的改變，在我和我太太之間來來去去的。對一個年紀還這麼小的孩子而言，如果她要一下跟爸爸住，一下跟媽媽住，她可能會很混亂。
4760	145	3	75	en-US	On this point, I agree with him. Our daughter is still young and little and it’s not appropriate to have the shared custody.

4865	161	3	36	zh-TW	我希望法院能判我女兒的全部撫養權給我, 那我有兩個理由.首先是, 我的太太已經沒有跟我們住在一起了, 我想要親眼看著我的孩子長大, 而且我也聽說我的太太已經跟別的男人同居了, 如果這事情是真的的話, 那我懷疑她有辦法給我們孩子最好的照顧, 因此我希望能得到所有的撫養權

That is, the child will accompany the mother for a period of time and then accompany with the father for another period of time.
4903	161	3	74	zh-TW	我個人不太喜歡這樣的決定, 因為我的女兒還太小了, 她才8個月大而已, 我不希望她在我和我妻子之間來來回回的, 對一個這麼小的孩子來說, 她會非常疑惑, 為什麼一下跟這個… 一下跟爸爸一下跟媽媽… 相處一段時間
4904	161	3	75	en-US	I agree with my husband at the point. Our daughter is too young, it will not be a good resolution to use the shared custody.

4937	169	3	36	zh-TW	我希望我可以獲得我女兒的全部撫養權，有以下兩個原因首先，我太太已經不和我們住在一起了我想要參與我女兒的成長過程此外，我還聽說我的…妻子已經和另一個男人同居了如果真的是那樣的話，我很懷疑她是不是能好好地照顧我的小孩因此，我希望我可以獲得全部扶養權
4938	169	3	37	en-US	Do you mean that even you both still engage in the divorce case, your wife…already lived with another man?And you also doubt that she lived with another manBased on this situation, it is the reason why you don’t want to give the custody of children to your wife?

5005	177	3	32	en-US	Your honor. Today I mainly want to verify the child custody in the marriage. I would also like to know that why both of you think that you can raise the child alone. Please elaborate this point further. Besides, I also know that both of you are also under the case of divorce. Therefore, I hope that both of you can avoid verbal attack in this court.
5006	177	3	33	zh-TW	我了解
5007	177	3	34	en-US	I understand.
5008	177	3	35	en-US	First, defendant, may I ask you some questions? Why do you want to fight for the custody of your child? Based on my understanding, you don’t a fulltime job in Taiwan, and you’re a foreigner. In the process of the fighting for custody, what’s your advantages?
5009	177	3	36	zh-TW	我希望能夠得到小孩的全部扶養權，因為有以下兩個原因。首先我太太已經不跟我們住了。我想要陪在我孩子旁邊看他長大。此外，我太太也跟另外一個男人居住。如果這是真的的話，我懷疑我太太是不是能給我們的小孩最好的照顧。因此我想要單獨扶養。
5010	177	3	37	en-US	Do you mean that your wife is… when you’re fighting for the case of divorce, your wife no longer lives with you. Is that right? And you also doubt that she lives another man. Is it because of this kind of condition that you don’t want to share custody with her?
5011	177	3	38	zh-TW	是的，這些都是我主要的顧慮
5012	177	3	39	en-US	Besides, concerning your financial status, if you’re granted with the custody, what do you plan to raise your child?
5013	177	3	40	zh-TW	我現在的確沒有全職工作。但是我有很多兼職工作，這也有份固定的收入。我相信這份收入能夠支撐我和我女兒的生活。
5014	177	3	41	en-US	You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. So because they’re all part-time jobs, so could you tell us that how much money will you gain on a regular basis.
5015	177	3	42	zh-TW	平均而言我有四到五個兼職工作。總共來說大概會有五萬塊的收入。有時候如果有新的計劃的時候，我也會有額外的收入。
5016	177	3	43	en-US	My another question is that will you bring your daughter back to Canada and no longer stays in Taiwan after you’re granted with the custody? The reason why I asked so is that even if you are granted with the custody, your wife may also be granted with the visitation right. If you bring your child back to Canada, you will become, to a degree, cut the tie between your wife and your child. To this, what’s your plea?
5017	177	3	44	zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年。我有居留證，我也喜歡這個地方。目前為止我沒有任何離開台灣的計畫。特別是因為我認為我的女兒有權利見到爸爸媽媽。我想說的是，雖然我和我太太現在正在打離婚的官司，我從來沒有想過要切斷她和我女兒之間的聯繫。在整個離婚官司的過程中，我會固定寄女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至安排了一些行程，讓他和女兒能夠見面。
5018	177	3	45	en-US	So you mean that in the short run you don’t have the plan to go back to Canada.
5019	177	3	46	zh-TW	我的確有回加拿大的打算，因為我母親年邁且身體不好。然而就算我回去加拿大的話我也不會待太久。我也不會考慮把女兒帶著一起回加拿大的可能。
5020	177	3	47	en-US	Now, Ms. 石, I have some questions for you. Don’t you live with your husband anymore?
5021	177	3	48	en-US	Yes, we have been separated for six months.
5022	177	3	49	en-US	When did you file the case of divorce?
5023	177	3	50	en-US	About two months ago.
5024	177	3	51	en-US	In other words, much earlier before your filing divorce case, you no longer lives with him. Is that right?
5025	177	3	52	en-US	Yes.
5026	177	3	53	en-US	So could you tell us your living condition? I mean, who do you live with?
5027	177	3	54	en-US	I live with my son in my first marriage.
5028	177	3	55	en-US	Your first marriage? What the marriage between Mr. Johnson.
5029	177	3	56	en-US	He’s my second husband.
5030	177	3	57	en-US	So, we’re dealing with the custody of your second husband and your daughter in your second marriage.
5031	177	3	58	en-US	Yes.
5032	177	3	59	en-US	How old is your son and your daughter.
5033	177	3	60	en-US	My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.
5034	177	3	61	en-US	When you moved out, your daughter stays with who? You or your husband?
5035	177	3	62	en-US	When I was moving out, because she’s only two months old, so she stayed with me.
5036	177	3	63	en-US	What does your daughter stay with?
5037	177	3	64	en-US	Now she lives with my husband?
5038	177	3	65	en-US	Is there some kind of arrangement between you two? Why was the daughter staying with you, and then is staying with your husband.
5039	177	3	66	en-US	The apartment after I moved out is quite smaller. The original house is bigger. In terms of the living condition, my husband can provide a better environment.
5040	177	3	67	en-US	If the objective circumstances aren’t changed. Your living condition isn’t good for your daughter, isn’t it? Then why do you hope for the custody of your child?
5041	177	3	68	en-US	She is my child. It took me ten months to give birth to the baby. How could I be... and my husband is candadian, I’m not sure when he will go back to Canada, and his work isn’t stable. Then that means I can no longer see my daughter.
5042	177	3	69	en-US	Therefore, I hope to fight for the custody. As for your financial status, could you elaborate that how you are going to raise your child.
5043	177	3	70	en-US	We are currently in the case of divorce. I hope that I can get my husband’s house after the case. So in terms of the living condition, that house is very appropriate for my daughter. And as for my personal financial status, I have provided the court a copy of my asset list. Besides, I have a fulltime job. I can earn around 40000 per month. I think I am able to raise my daughter. 
5044	177	3	71	en-US	So how’s your divorce case going? When will the court’s decisions be made? I mean do you roughly know the time?
5045	177	3	72	en-US	I’m not sure about it. This week we have another court. I want express my idea to the court that I wish the court can be finished as soon as possible.
5046	177	3	73	en-US	Now let us do this. The court will arrange social workers to your children. And they will make evaluation about the relationship between you and your child. That will be the court’s reference to see who is better for the child. Before that I want to ask that will you consider the possibility of shared custody? The definition of shared custody is that the child stays with father for some time and stays with the mother for another time.
5047	177	3	74	zh-TW	我個人不喜歡這個提案，因為我女兒還太小，他只有八個月大。我不希望他在我和我太太之間搬來搬去。這個方式對這麼年幼的小孩來說太混淆了，怎麼可以讓她一下跟爸爸住一下跟媽媽住呢
5048	177	3	75	en-US	Concerning this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small. She is not supposed to go through the process of shared custody.
5049	177	3	76	en-US	So we will have the social workers get to you first. After they finish the report, we will arrange the court date to give the opinion rights of both parties.
5050	177	3	77	zh-TW	我對社工探視沒有意見

5081	185	3	36	zh-TW	我希望得到孩子的扶養權因為下列的原因。首先，我的老婆不再陪著我們。我想要跟著我的女兒一起成長。此外，我知道我的老婆和別的男人現在正在一起。如果那是真的，我很懷疑我的老婆是否有辦法好好照顧我們的女兒。因此，我希望能爭取全部扶養權。
5082	185	3	37	en-US	You mean that you are in the case of divorce with your wife, and she doesn’t live with you now? And you think she lives with other man? Because of this concern, you don’t want to your child lives with her?

5085	185	3	40	zh-TW	沒錯，我現在在台灣並沒有全職的工作。但是我有七份兼職工作，那使我的收入跟全職收入一樣多。我相信這樣的收入足夠負擔我和我女兒的生活費。
5086	185	3	41	en-US	You just mention that you have many part time jobs. Because all of them are part time jobs, you think you may have how much fixed income every month?
5087	185	3	42	zh-TW	我平均有四到五份兼職工作。平均來說，我一個月會有五萬元收入。有時候如果我額外接收到工作，我會有更多的收入。
5088	185	3	43	en-US	For the other question that I want to ask is that if you get the custody of your child, will you go to Canada and never come back again? I asked the question just because even if you have the custody, your wife may remain the visitation right. If you bring your child to your country, it may become a problem that you deliberately separate the child and your wife. For this point, what’s your point?
5089	185	3	44	zh-TW	我已經在台灣生活了五年，我擁有居留證而且我喜愛這個地方，到目前為止我沒有離開台灣的任何打算，而且我的女兒有權利見到我和我太太。我必須強調的是，即使我和我太太正在進行離婚官司，但我並沒有想要切斷小孩和我太太的關係。在打官司的期間，我也有將我女兒的照片傳給我老婆。我甚至鼓勵他和我女兒見面。
5090	185	3	45	en-US	So, you mean that you don’t have the plan to go back your country, right?

5094	185	3	49	en-US	When did you file a divorce case?
5095	185	3	50	en-US	Maybe two months before.
5096	185	3	51	en-US	So, before you filed the case, you didn’t live with your husband?
5097	185	3	52	en-US	Yes.
5098	185	3	53	en-US	What’s you living status? I mean, you live with whom?
5099	185	3	54	en-US	I live with my son who is from my first marriage.
5100	185	3	55	en-US	First marriage?
5101	185	3	56	en-US	He is my second husband

5109	185	3	64	en-US	Now, my daughter lives with my husband.
5110	185	3	65	en-US	Do you have any agreement? Why your daughter lived with you first, and now she lives with your husband? 
5111	185	3	66	en-US	  The place that I live now is not big so my child lives with my husband. For environmental concern, my daughter lives with my husband now.
5112	185	3	67	en-US	Just for the objective circumstances, the situation for your daughter is not good, right? Why would you have the custody of your child?
5113	185	3	68	en-US	She is my child, how could I live without her? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian, and he might go back to Canada any time. If that’s a case, I cannot meet my daughter anymore. So, I want to have the custody.
5114	185	3	69	en-US	For your financial status, can you explain more that how would you rear your child?
5115	185	3	70	en-US	We are in divorce case now. I hope, after the case, I can live in the house that my husband lives now. The house is good for my daughter to grow up.

5116	185	3	71	en-US	How’s your divorce case now? When will the sentence out? 
5117	185	3	72	en-US	I am not sure. This Friday, we will go to the court again. I want to tell the judge who charges our divorce case that I hope the sentence out fast.
5118	185	3	73	en-US	Ok, so, the court will arrange the social workers to visit both parties. And the social workers will evaluate the situation. After the court sees the report, we will think who is better for the child. But before that, do both parties want to share the custody? The term of shared custody means that sometimes the child lives with father and sometimes lives with mother.
5119	185	3	74	zh-TW	 就目前來說，我並不想這麼打算，因為我的小孩還太小。她只有八個月大，我不希望她一直在我和我老婆之間來來回回。對於這麼小的小孩來說，對於她一下要來這邊一下要去那邊，會讓她感到困擾。
5120	185	3	75	en-US	For this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small, and it’s not suitable for shared custody.
5121	185	3	76	en-US	We will arrange social workers’ visitation first. After they finish the report, we will set the next court date. Both parties will have chance to state, is that ok?

5153	193	3	36	zh-TW	我希望你能夠把女兒全部的撫養權都判給我。第一點是：我的妻子沒有和我住在一起了。我希望看著我的孩子成長。此外，我也聽說我的妻子現在正和其他男人住在一起。如果這是事實的話，那我會懷疑我的妻子是否能給我們的女兒最好的照顧。因此這就是我希望有全部撫養權的原因。
5154	193	3	37	en-US	 Do you mean you and your wife are having the divorce trial, and she does not live with you, and you also suspect that she is living with another man, so because of the two reasons you do not want to let your wife have the custody, is that right?

5160	193	3	43	en-US	The next question is if you have your daughter’s custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and do not come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask is when you have the custody, but your wife also have the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, it will cut your daughter’s  ties with your wife. What’s your opinion about this point?
5161	193	3	44	zh-TW	我已經待在台灣5年了。我有居留證，我也喜歡台灣。目前我並沒有離開台灣的打算，特別我認為，我的小孩有權…應該要有機會能夠看到父母。我想要強調的是，雖然我和我的妻子正打算離婚，但是我並沒有打算切斷他們母女的關係。就算我們在打離婚官司的期間，我也會定期寄照片給我的妻子。我甚至安排家庭聚會的時間，讓她和我們的女兒跟我一起見面，培養感情。
5162	193	3	45	en-US	Currently, you do not have the plan to go back, is that right?
5163	193	3	46	zh-TW	不，我可能會回去，但這是因為我母親年事已高又已經生病了。但是即使我回去，我也不會待在那裏很久。更不會想要把女兒帶過去。
5164	193	3	47	en-US	Now, I am going to ask the other part some questions. Don’t you live with your husband?

5181	193	3	64	en-US	Now my daughter live with my husband.
5182	193	3	65	en-US	Do you have some agreements with your husband? Why does your daughter fist live with you, but with your husband later?
5183	193	3	66	en-US	The house I moved into is smaller than the house I lived with my husband. So take the environment into consideration, I think our previous house is better for my daughter.
5184	193	3	67	en-US	So, in the objective circumstance, which means the living environmental, if the house is the same as yours, you will live with your daughter, is that right? So why do you want to have the custody of your daughter?
5185	193	3	68	en-US	I spend ten months bearing…to…, how could I live without her. And my husband is a Canadian, and he does not have regular income, he might have the possibility to go back to Canada any time.

The court will take those two factors into consider, and consider who will give the daughter the best …condition. Before we give the custody, do you have the willingness to have shared custody? The shared custody means the child live with the parent …live with the father for a while, and live with the mother for a while.
5191	193	3	74	zh-TW	就我個人的意見的話，我不贊同共同撫養，因為我的女兒還太小，她只有八個月大。我不想她不能適應我跟妻子之間的變動。對一個這麼小的小孩來說，跟父親或母親只住在一起一段時間會造成她的混淆。
5192	193	3	75	en-US	In this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small, she is not …the shared custody is not good for her.

5434	241	3	29	en-US	Today our case is the child rearing case between Ferry Johnson and Tsai-Yung Shu. Have you all… Have you both appointed lawyers?
5435	241	3	30	en-US	Yes, I have.
5436	241	3	31	zh-TW	我也有…一名律師。
5437	241	3	32	en-US	Today for our preparatory case, my main goal today is to understand your main positions in the case. I would also like to know the reason why both of you believe you are more fitting to take care of the child. Could you please emphasize your views on this later on. Besides, I am also aware that you are in the court for divorce at the moment. So I would not like to hear any verbal attack between the two parties, do you understand?
5438	241	3	33	zh-TW	我了解。
5439	241	3	34	en-US	I understand.
5440	241	3	35	en-US	Ok, first I would like to ask: Why do you want… the right to take care of your child. As far as I know, you do not have an official job in Taipei. You are also a foreigner. Why do you believe you are a more suitable person for custody?
5441	241	3	36	zh-TW	我希望擁有我女兒的全部扶養權，因為兩個原因。首先，我老婆並沒有汗我住在一起。我想要看著我的女兒長大。另外我還有聽到我的老婆漢另外一個男人同住。如果這屬實，我深切地懷疑她是否適合照顧我們的女兒，於是我希望取得全部扶養權。
5442	241	3	37	en-US	What you mean is…while your wife has filed a divorce case with you, she is not living with you at the moment. And you have doubts about whether she is living with another man. And therefore, you are not willing to let your wife take care of your children, is that right?
5443	241	3	38	zh-TW	是的，這是我主要的顧慮。
5444	241	3	39	en-US	Next is about your financial status, and that means, if you receive custody of your child, how will you deal with the money?
5445	241	3	40	zh-TW	我的確沒有一個全職的工作，但我有幾個兼職的工作，所以…我是有收入的。我認為這些收入是夠照顧我自己與女兒的。
5446	241	3	41	en-US	You mentioned you have many part time jobs. Because they are not fixed, can you estimate your fixed income for each month?
5447	241	3	42	zh-TW	我平均有四到五個…五份兼任的工作。加起來的話，大概會有一個月一萬五的收入。通常，如果我有新的專案的話，我就會有更多收入。
5448	241	3	43	en-US	Next, I would like to ask you: If you received custody of your child, is it possible that you will bring your child to Canada, and never come back? My reason for asking this is even though you receive custody, your wife still has a visitation right. If you bring your child back to your country, it will equal…your preventing your wife from seeing the child. What do you have to say about this?
5449	241	3	44	zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了，我有居留證我也喜歡這個地方。至今我還沒有任核計劃要離開。尤其是我覺得…我女兒應該有見到她父母的權利。我想要強調的是：即使我和我老婆正在進行離婚程序，但我並不想要阻絕我老婆和我女兒…相見的機會。我們在辦離婚手續的這段期間，我都會固定送女兒的照片給老婆看。我也會計劃一些戶外的活動…讓女兒和老婆見面。
5450	241	3	45	en-US	So you mean in the short term, you have no plans to go back to your country.
5451	241	3	46	zh-TW	不是，我可能會回到加拿大，因為我媽媽年紀大了，也生病了。但即便我回去，也不會待太久。我甚至完全不會考慮將我女兒一起帶回去。
5452	241	3	47	en-US	OK, now I’d like to ask the other party. So, you are not living with your husband anymore?
5453	241	3	48	en-US	Yes, we’ve been separated for six months.
5454	241	3	49	en-US	When did you file the case for divorce?
5455	241	3	50	en-US	About two months ago.
5456	241	3	51	en-US	So you’ve been separated even before you filed a lawsuit for divorce.
5457	241	3	52	en-US	Yes.
5458	241	3	53	en-US	So may I ask your living situation? What I mean is, who are you living with?
5459	241	3	54	en-US	I’m living with my son from my first marriage.
5460	241	3	55	en-US	Your first marriage? So, the marriage between you and the….defendant…which…
5461	241	3	56	en-US	He is my second husband.
5462	241	3	57	en-US	So the custody that you both are seeking…. is for your second child, your daughter?
5463	241	3	58	en-US	Yes.
5464	241	3	59	en-US	How old is your son? And how old is your daughter?
5465	241	3	60	en-US	My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.
5466	241	3	61	en-US	When you moved out, did your daughter stay with the father or with you?
5467	241	3	62	en-US	When I moved out, the child was only six months old and needed me to take care of her, so she went with me.
5468	241	3	63	en-US	And who is the child with at this moment?
5469	241	3	64	en-US	Now the child is with my husband.
5470	241	3	65	en-US	Have you reached any sort of agreement? Why was the daughter with you at the first point, and now with… the husband?
5471	241	3	66	en-US	My accommodation when I moved out is smaller than before. Considering the environment…the living environment, the old house was better, so I sent my daughter back.
5472	241	3	67	en-US	So if the objective circumstances, or the living environment has changed, it’s not good for your daughter either, isn’t it? Then why would you want to fight for your child’s custody?
5473	241	3	68	en-US	I bore her for ten months! How could I even consider leaving her? Besides, my husband is a Canadian citizen. He doesn’t even have a stable job. If so, I might never see my daughter again. So I wish to… to receive custody for my child.
5474	241	3	69	en-US	Concerning your financial status, can you elaborate…more about how you will take care of your daughter?
5475	241	3	70	en-US	We are still in the middle of our divorce case. I wish to receive the house that my husband is living in right now. That would be a better environment for my daughter to grow up in. And about my financial status, I provided the court with my asset list. I also have a fixed job. I earn 40 thousand dollars each month. Or more. I think I’m capable of taking care of my daughter.
5476	241	3	71	en-US	How is your divorce case going? Have you estimated what time the courts decision will come out?
5477	241	3	72	en-US	I’m not sure. We will come to court again this Friday. I wish to tell the judge of the divorce case that I would like to see the results of the divorce case come out sooner.
5478	241	3	73	en-US	How about this, the court will send a social worker to visit both parties. Then they will evaluate the situation of both parties to see if they are fit to take care of the child. The report will be considered by the court to make the decision. But prior to that, I would like to ask if you consider…a shared custody? Shared custody entails that the child for a period of time stays with the father, and another period stays with the mother.
5479	241	3	74	zh-TW	我個人比較不偏好這個選擇，因為我的女兒年紀還太小。她只有八個月大。不希望她承受…這樣子的變化。對一個年紀這麼小的孩子來說，她會感到太困惑了，如果她有一段時間與一個人同住，然後另一段時間又搬去另一個地方。
5480	241	3	75	en-US	On this, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young. It is not suitable to…for shared custody.
5481	241	3	76	en-US	OK, after that, let’s consider the social worker…visit. After they have devised a report, we will plan a date to come to court to give both of you an opportunity to elaborate on your decisions.
5482	241	3	77	zh-TW	好，沒問題。
5483	241	3	78	en-US	I have no problem with the decision either, thank you.
5484	249	3	1	en-US	Today, we’re here for the preparatory procedure of child rearing case number 2345.
5485	249	3	8	en-US	I’m here for the child rearing case, case number 2345 as an interpreter. I promise to faithfully and honestly translate/interpret what is stated in this court. In the case of deliberately making false interpretation, the violation of perjury will apply.

5495	249	3	18	en-US	You have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.
5496	249	3	19	en-US	You have the right to a lawyer.

5505	249	3	28	en-US	Floor number 5, number 414, section 3, Chung cheng road, shihling district, Taipei city.
5506	249	3	29	en-US	Today, we’re here for the preparatory procedure between Madam Shih Tsai Yun and Ferry Johnson. Have both of you asked for a lawyer?
5507	249	3	30	en-US	Yes, I have asked a lawyer to help me.
5508	249	3	31	zh-TW	我也有請。
5509	249	3	32	en-US	Today, the judge here wants to know more about the perspective of each party about child rearing. The judge also wants to know why both of you consider yourselves the most appropriate one to rear this child, so please elaborate this point, do you understand? In addition, I know that both of you are trying to get a divorce. Therefore, I do not wish to see that both of you have a verbal attack against each other. Do you understand?
5510	249	3	33	zh-TW	好，是的。
5511	249	3	34	en-US	Okay.
5512	249	3	35	en-US	Okay now, I have some questions to ask the plaintiff. Please tell me the reasons why you wish to rear your child. According the information I’ve received, you do not have a full-time job in Taiwan, and you’re a foreigner, so why do you consider yourself the most appropriate person to have child custody?
5513	249	3	36	zh-TW	現在有兩個原因去支持為什麼我比較適任於擁有子女撫養權。首先，我已經沒有和太太住在一起了，我想看著孩子長大。而且我還聽說我的太太和別的男人住在一起了。若是這樣的話，她應該不會給予我女兒真正應得的關愛。因此，我適任得到全部的撫養權。
5514	249	3	37	en-US	So do you mean that now, you’re preparing for a divorce, and your wife is no longer living with you, and you suspect her of living with another guy. Due to the situation like this, you do not wish to let her take care of the child, is that so? 
5515	249	3	38	zh-TW	是啊，這就是我主要的原因。
5516	249	3	39	en-US	Okay, then if…umm..according to your financial status, and if you really do receive the sole custody, then how are you planning to take care of the child?
5517	249	3	40	zh-TW	我現在確實沒有全職工作。但是，我好幾個間質的工作，因此，我有固定的收入。這些收入足以養活我自己和我的女兒。
5518	249	3	41	en-US	You’ve just mentioned about that you have several part-time jobs. Due to they are part-time jobs in their nature, can you tell me an estimated income per month?
5519	249	3	42	zh-TW	平均來說，我有四到五份兼職工作。總共來說，我每個月會賺進五萬台幣。若我有找到其他工作的話，我的收入會高於五萬。
5520	249	3	43	en-US	Another question that I would like to ask you is once you receive the child custody, is it possible that you would just take the child to Canada and never come back? The reason why I asked you this is that even of you receive the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. So if you do this, if you just take the child to Canada with you, then it means that you just cut the ties between your daughter and your wife. So, according to this problem, what would you like to say?
5521	249	3	44	zh-TW	我在台灣已經待了五年了吧。我有居留證號碼，而且我喜歡這個地方。目前為止，我是沒有要離開台灣的打算。而且我有認為我女兒應該要擁有見雙方父母的權利。縱使我和我太太目前正辦理離婚，但是，我不打算要切斷她們之間的關係。在我們辦理離婚手續的過程當中，我常常會將我女兒的照片給我太太看。我甚至會辦一些活動啊，或是約。。。我們大家一起出去。
5522	249	3	45	en-US	 Okay, so you mean that currently, you do not have any plans to return to your mother country?
5523	249	3	46	zh-TW	恩，不不不，我是有可能回加拿大，因為我母親現在生病啦。但縱使我回去加拿大，我也不會長期待在那裡。我應該也不會想要把我女兒帶那裡。
5524	249	3	47	en-US	Okay, now, I would like to ask the other party some questions. Are you still living with your husband or not?
5525	249	3	48	en-US	Well, we’re not living together anymore for six months.
5526	249	3	49	en-US	When did you ask for a divorce?
5527	249	3	50	en-US	About a month ago, I think.
5528	249	3	51	en-US	Okay, that means before you asked for a divorce, you two have not been living together, right? 
5529	249	3	52	en-US	Yes, that’s right. 
5530	249	3	53	en-US	So, who are you living with now? What’s the condition now?
5531	249	3	54	en-US	I live with the former husband’s son.
5532	249	3	55	en-US	Oh, your former husband….first marriage? Then, how about the husband you have now? 
5533	249	3	56	en-US	Well, he’s my second husband.
5534	249	3	57	en-US	Now, we’re trying to figure out the custody is about the child you have with your second husband. She’s a daughter?
5535	249	3	58	en-US	Yes, that’s right.
5536	249	3	59	en-US	Then how old is your son, and how old is your daughter?
5537	249	3	60	en-US	My son is seven years old, and my daughter eight months old.
5538	249	3	61	en-US	The time when you moved out, your daughter, who did she go with?
5539	249	3	62	en-US	At that time, my daughter was only two months old; therefore, she needs my care, so she stayed with me.
5540	249	3	63	en-US	And now, who is she staying with?
5541	249	3	64	en-US	Now, she’s staying with my husband.
5542	249	3	65	en-US	Did you have any pact between each other? Why does your daughter stayed with you, and then, she’s staying with your husband now? 
5543	249	3	66	en-US	The place where I moved out to live is a bit small, and the place where my husband lives is quite large. Therefore, due to the environment and circumstances, I just wished my daughter to live with him. 
5544	249	3	67	en-US	Okay, so if the objective circumstances do not change, then is your place still not better than your husband’s? Then why did you wish to receive the child’s sole custody?
5545	249	3	68	en-US	Hey, I am the one who bear her for ten months, I can’t live without her. Moreover, my husband is a Canadian, he does not have a fixed income, and he even has the possibility to return to Canada. If so, then I’ll lose the right to visit my daughter. Therefore, I’m here to gain for the custody. 
5546	249	3	69	en-US	In terms of your financial status, can you describe how you would raise the child?
5547	249	3	70	en-US	Now, we’re still trying to divorce, and I would like to get the right of living in the place where my husband is now living. Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it would be perfect for my daughter to grow up. As for my current financial status, I have let the court see my asset list. Moreover, I have a very regular income and a very stable job. My monthly income would be no less than forty thousand. Therefore, I believe that I have the ability to take care of my daughter.
5548	249	3	71	en-US	Okay, so how is your divorce case going on? Do you know why you will get the verdict, approximately when?
5549	249	3	72	en-US	Well, I’m not sure. We’ll go to the court this Friday again. I would like to ask the court to make a decision of the verdict sooner. 
5550	249	3	73	en-US	 The court will ask social workers to visit the home of both parties and make an evaluation of each of your ways of taking care of the child. And the court will decide according their report of how you take care of the child. Before this, I would like to ask both parties do you mind of having a shared custody? Shared custody means that the child can stay with her father for a while, and stay with her mother for another while
5551	249	3	74	zh-TW	恩，我不太想要耶，因為我女兒還小。她才八個月大。我不想要她一下子陪我，然後一下子又陪我太太。如果是這樣的狀況的話，我的女兒她這麼小，她會覺得很混亂。
5552	249	3	75	en-US	I agree with my husband’s point. My daughter is too young; therefore, shared custody is not the right choice for us. 
5553	249	3	76	en-US	Okay, if so, then we’ll just begin our progress of sending the social workers. And after receiving their report, we’ll set up a time to open the court again. Therefore, you two will have the chance of making a statement, okay? 
5554	249	3	77	zh-TW	恩，好的，社工人員可以來我家。
5555	249	3	78	en-US	I have no problem with that, either, thank you.
5556	257	3	1	en-US	Today, we are here for the preparation procedure for the case of child rearing, case number 234.
5557	257	3	8	en-US	I’m here today for the case of child rearing, case number 234, as an interpreter. I promise to faithfully and honestly translate what is stated in this court. In the case of deliberately making false interpretation, the violation of perjury will apply.

5579	257	3	30	en-US	Yes, I have hired a lawyer.
5580	257	3	31	zh-TW	我也有。
5581	257	3	32	en-US	Today, the court is to understand the position for these two people in terms of the child rearing. Besides, the court also hopes to know whether you two have the capacity to rear the child. Please elaborate in terms of this point. Besides, we know that you also have the case of divorce about this case. Therefore, we hope that you two will not have verbal attacks with one another and have a quarrel.
5582	257	3	33	zh-TW	我了解。
5583	257	3	34	en-US	I understand.
5584	257	3	35	en-US	First, the plaintiff, please, why do you want to have the right to rear your child? As the court investigates, you don’t have a formal job in Taiwan. You haven’t had a formal job in Taiwan yet. Beside, you are a foreigner. Why do you think that you have the capacity to take care of your child?
5585	257	3	36	zh-TW	我希望法院可以判給我全部撫養權，因為兩個原因。首先，我妻子不再跟我一起生活了。我想在這邊看我女兒長大。此外，我還聽說我妻子還跟另外一個男人共處。如果那是真的的話，我就懷疑她是否能撫養我們的女兒。所以我想要有全部的撫養權。
5586	257	3	37	en-US	You mean that your wife is not under the same roof with you, and you are dealing with the case about divorce. Besides, you are also suspicious about whether she stays with a other man. Is this the very reason for you to have the sole custody?
5587	257	3	38	zh-TW	是，這是我的主要原因。
5588	257	3	39	en-US	About your financial status, if you get the sole custody of your daughter, how do you rear your daughter?
5589	257	3	40	zh-TW	我現在沒有全職的工作。但是我有許多兼職的工作，讓我有固定的收入。我覺得這些收入已經足夠養活我和我的女兒了。
5590	257	3	41	en-US	You just mentioned that you have some part-time job. Because these jobs are not formal, do you have the whole overview of your regular income? Whether it is fixed?
5591	257	3	42	zh-TW	我平均有4到5個兼職工作。大約可以讓我賺5萬塊吧。如果我有其他案子的話，收入會更多。
5592	257	3	43	en-US	Besides, the court would like to ask another question. Do you plan to bring her back to Canada and do not return to Taiwan after you have the sole custody? The reason for asking this question is that your wife may still have the visitation right after you have the sole custody. If you bring your daughter back to your country, it may evolve into a situation that you cut the tie between your wife and your daughter. About this point, what do you want to say?
5593	257	3	44	zh-TW	我在台灣已經待了5年了。我己經有了居留證號碼，也喜歡這個地方。我沒有任何離開台灣的打算。我認為，其實女兒有可以看我們雙親的權利。我想要強調一點，雖然我們現在打離婚官司，但我沒有要切斷他們兩個聯繫的意圖。在我們打離婚官司的時候，我還寄了不少我女兒的照片給老婆呢。我甚至安排時間能讓我和女兒、還有我的太太一起出遊呢。
5594	257	3	45	en-US	You mean that recently, you don’t have the plan to return to your country.
5595	257	3	46	zh-TW	其實我也可能會回加拿大，因為我媽媽很老、很虛弱。如果我回國，也不會待太久，甚至不考慮把我女兒一起拜去加拿大。
5596	257	3	47	en-US	Okay, now I’m going to ask the other party. Is that true that you don’t live with your husband?
5597	257	3	48	en-US	Yes, we have been separated for about 6 months.
5598	257	3	49	en-US	When did you file the case about your divorce?
5599	257	3	50	en-US	About 2 months ago.
5600	257	3	51	en-US	That is to say, before you file the divorce case, you two have not lived together. Is that true?
5601	257	3	52	en-US	Yes.
5602	257	3	53	en-US	So, how is your living situation? I mean that who accompanies you, live with you.
5603	257	3	54	en-US	I live with my son with my first marriage.
5604	257	3	55	en-US	Your first marriage? What is the time of marriage with the plaintiff?
5605	257	3	56	en-US	He is my second husband.
5606	257	3	57	en-US	Therefore, you are seeking to the custody of your daughter, who you have with the second husband.
5607	257	3	58	en-US	Yes.
5608	257	3	59	en-US	How old is your son with your first marriage?
5609	257	3	60	en-US	My son is 7 years old, and my daughter is about 8 months.
5610	257	3	61	en-US	After you move away from your house, you bring your daughter with you?
5611	257	3	62	en-US	Because at that time, my daughter was only 2 months, she still needed my support.
5612	257	3	63	en-US	Now, where is your daughter?
5613	257	3	64	en-US	My daughter is living with my husband.
5614	257	3	65	en-US	Do you two have any agreements with each other because firstly, she lives with you, and now she lives with your husband?
5615	257	3	66	en-US	The house I’m living after moving out is smaller than the one that I stayed with my husband. In terms of the environment, I think it is better to stay in the original house with my husband.
5616	257	3	67	en-US	If the objective circumstance about your house is not better than your husband’s house, it is not good for your daughter, isn’t it? Why do you want to have the right to rear your daughter?
5617	257	3	68	en-US	I had been pregnant about 10 months for the daughter. How can I just give my daughter to my husband? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian. He don’t have regular jobs and formal jobs, I’m afraid that he will go back to Canada. If that is true, I will not see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I would like to strike to have the right to rear my daughter.
5618	257	3	69	en-US	For your financial status, please elaborate how you will take care of your daughter in the future.
5619	257	3	70	en-US	We are still dealing with the case of our divorce. Now, I’m seeking to win, to have the right to live in the original house, which now my husband is living. Therefore, in terms of the living conditions and environment, the original house is better for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have provided a asset list for my income. Besides, I have a formal job in Taiwan, and the regular payment is 40,000 NT dollars. I think that I have the capacity to take care of my daughter.
5620	257	3	71	en-US	How is your divorce case now? Do you have the idea about the exact time to close your divorce case?
5621	257	3	72	en-US	I’m not sure. This Friday, we will attend the court about my marriage. I hope that I will ask the court to have their decision faster and earlier.
5622	257	3	73	en-US	Okay, the court will arrange social workers to visit you two, and these social workers will evaluate in terms of the circumstances about rearing your daughter. We will make further decision in terms of their observation. However, before that, can have shared custody? Shared custody is that your daughter will stay with your husband a whole and later will spend some time with the mother.
5623	257	3	74	zh-TW	我個人認為，我不太想要共同扶養權，我女兒還很小，只有8個月大，我不希望她在我跟太太之間送來送去的。對一個只有8個月的小孩來說，一下子跟我住，一下子又跟她媽媽住的話，會讓她十分困擾。
5624	257	3	75	en-US	About this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is still too young. It is not appropriate for her to live with the shared custody.
5625	257	3	76	en-US	Therefore, the court will first arrange social workers to visit with you two parties. After their report and observation, we will further set a court day. Therefore, on that day, you can elaborate further about this case.
5626	257	3	77	zh-TW	好的，我可以接受社工人員的拜訪。
5627	257	3	78	en-US	Yes, I’m okay as well for this arranging.

5650	265	3	29	en-US	Today we are here for preparatory procedure of child rearing case for Tsai-Win Shi and Ferry Johnson. Both of you apply for a lawyer?
5651	265	3	30	en-US	Yes, I have a lawyer.
5652	265	3	31	zh-TW	我也有請律師
5653	265	3	32	en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, I am going to know the position of both of you. I also want to know why both of you think that you can have the sole custody. Please elaborate for this point. Besides, you two are under the divorce procedure. Therefore, please do not have verbal attack with each other. Is this okay?
5654	265	3	33	zh-TW	我知道了
5655	265	3	34	en-US	I understand.
5656	265	3	35	en-US	Plantiff, why do you strive for the child’s sole custody? As far as I am concerned, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan. You are a foreigner. Why do you think that you have the right to have the child’s sole custody.
5657	265	3	36	zh-TW	因為以下兩點，所以我想爭取孩子的獨立撫養權第一，我的妻子沒跟我同住，我想看我女兒長大，更何況我聽說我妻子跟另外一個男人住，如果這是真的，我很懷疑她是否能給我們女兒最好的照顧，因此能擁有獨立的撫養權
5658	265	3	37	en-US	You mean that your wife has no longer lived with you, even if you two are still under the divorce procedure? Moreover, you also suspend she is now living with another man? It is because this situation therefore you do not want to give her the custody?
5659	265	3	38	zh-TW	是的，這是我的主要考量
5660	265	3	39	en-US	How do you plan to take care of your daughter according to your financial status?
5661	265	3	40	zh-TW	我目前的確沒有全職工作，但我有好幾份兼職，也有穩定的收入，我想這收入足夠我養活我的女兒和自己
5662	265	3	41	en-US	You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because what you did is still the part-time jobs, can you evaluate how much do you earn per month regularly?
5663	265	3	42	zh-TW	 我平均來說有四五份兼職，總計大概有五萬台幣，有時如果找到新的兼職，我可能還會有額外的收入
5664	265	3	43	en-US	I want to ask that if you get your daughter’s sole custody, will you go back to Canada and never come back to Taiwan again? The reason why I ask this question is that if you get the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, the situation will be that you separate your daughter with her mom. As for this, what’s your explanation?
5665	265	3	44	zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了，也有了居留證，而我也很喜歡這裡，目前為止我沒有打算離開台灣，另外，我也覺得我女兒有權利見到父母雙方，我想要強調，儘管我跟我太太正在打離婚官司，但我並不想切斷我女兒的聯繫，在我們打離婚官司的過程中，我也好幾次發我女兒的照片給我太太，我甚至邀請她和我女兒一起出遊
5666	265	3	45	en-US	You mean that you do not plan to go back to your hometown?
5667	265	3	46	zh-TW	是的，但我可能會回加拿大，因為我母親年老且生病了，但就算我回去，我也不會待太長時間，我甚至不考慮帶我女兒一起去
5668	265	3	47	en-US	Okay, then I will ask the other side some questions. Now you do not live with your husband, right?
5669	265	3	48	en-US	Yes, we live in different places for six months.
5670	265	3	49	en-US	When did you file the case for divorce?
5671	265	3	50	en-US	Maybe two months ago.
5672	265	3	51	en-US	That is to say, before you two seek for divorce, you did not live your husband?
5673	265	3	52	en-US	Yes.
5674	265	3	53	en-US	Then who do you live now?
5675	265	3	54	en-US	 I live with my son in my first marriage.
5676	265	3	55	en-US	First marriage? How about the plantiff?
5677	265	3	56	en-US	He is my second husband.
5678	265	3	57	en-US	So you are now striving for the custody of your daughter with the second husband?
5679	265	3	58	en-US	 Yes.
5680	265	3	59	en-US	How old is your son and your daughter?
5681	265	3	60	en-US	My son is 7 years old and my daughter is 8 months old.
5682	265	3	61	en-US	When you moved out, who did your daughter live with?
5683	265	3	62	en-US	My daughter was with because she was only two months old then.
5684	265	3	63	en-US	Who is your daughter living with now?
5685	265	3	64	en-US	Now my daughter is living with my husband. 
5686	265	3	65	en-US	Do you two have an agreement? Why the daughter first with you and now with your husband?
5687	265	3	66	en-US	The place where I live now is much smaller than the house I lived with my husband before. Considering the environment, my husband’s house is better for my daughter.
5688	265	3	67	en-US	Therefore, in objective circumstances, your place is not good for your daughter, right? Then why do you want the custody of your daughter?
5689	265	3	68	en-US	She is the one who I spent ten months to have, how can I live without her? My husband is a Canadian. Besides, his job is not stable. He might go back to Canada anytime. In that case, I cannot see my daughter again. So I want to have my daughter’s sole custody.
5690	265	3	69	en-US	In the terms of your financial status, can you explain how you are going to rear your daughter?
5691	265	3	70	en-US	We are still under the divorce case. I wish the court can let me in my husband’s house. Therefore, as to the environment, that house will be good for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have given the court my current asset list. Besides, I have a regular job and on average, I have NT$40000 per month. Therefore, I am able to take care of my daughter.
5692	265	3	71	en-US	I would like to ask that how’s your divorce case? When will the trial procedure be set?
5693	265	3	72	en-US	I am not sure about that. We have a court this Friday. I hope to ask the judge of my divorce case to have the result quickly.
5694	265	3	73	en-US	The court will send social workers to you and your husband’s houses, then evaluate the situation. The court will make the decision according to the social workers’ report. Before that, I want to ask that will you consider the shared custody? The shared custody is that your daughter will respectively live with mom and dad in a certain period.
5695	265	3	74	zh-TW	我個人認為這並不適合，因為我女兒還太小，她只有八個月大，我不想她在我和老婆間換來換去，這對我小孩來說，這會造成我小孩的混亂，當他一下跟爸爸，一下跟媽媽的時候
5696	265	3	75	en-US	At this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young to have the shared custody about rearing together.
5697	265	3	76	en-US	Okay, then we will first arrange for the social workers’ visit. After getting the report from the social workers, we will set the court date. Both of you have the right to state your opinions.
5698	265	3	77	zh-TW	我對於社工的探訪沒有問題

5723	273	3	30	en-US	Yes, I do.
5724	273	3	31	zh-TW	我也有
5725	273	3	32	en-US	Today the judge will want to know your positions of the child rearing. We also want to know why you think you are suitable for rearing this child. Please elaborate it according to this point. I know you are also in the divorce case. So we hope that you could avoid the verbal attack.
5726	273	3	33	zh-TW	我了解
5727	273	3	34	en-US	I understand.
5728	273	3	35	en-US	First, I would like to ask some questions for both of you. The plaintiff, why do you want to strive for the child rearing rights? As I know, you do not have full-time job in Taiwan. And your identity is foreigner. For this situation, why do you think you are more suitable?
5729	273	3	36	zh-TW	考量這2個原因，我希望能將全部撫養權判給我。第一，我的妻子沒有跟我一起住了。我想要看到我小孩長大。此外，我也聽說我的太太現在跟另外一個男人一起住。如果是這樣的話，我很懷疑他能給小孩一個好的成長環境嗎？所以我希望我能擁有全部的撫養權。
5730	273	3	37	en-US	So you mean that your wife is in the divorce case with you, but she does not live with you now? And you doubt that she lives with other man. It is this situation that makes you unwilling to make your children taken care of by her?
5731	273	3	38	zh-TW	是的，這就是我主要的考量緣故
5732	273	3	39	en-US	For your financial status concerns, if you get sole custody, how will you raise your daughter?
5733	273	3	40	zh-TW	的確，我現在沒有全職工作，但是我現在有兼好幾份打工，足以付足…。我想這些收入足夠撫養我的女兒。
5734	273	3	41	en-US	You mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because they are all part-time jobs, could you evaluate how much regular income you will get?
5735	273	3	42	zh-TW	我大概有4到5份的兼職工作。那這樣算起來的話，每個月我大概可以有5萬元的收入，此外我如果還有多一些工作的話，也許收入會增加。
5736	273	3	43	en-US	I have another question. If you have the custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and will not come back to Taiwan? I ask this is because that even if you get the custody, your wife still has the visitation rights. If you take your child back to your country, it means that you cut the tie between the mother and the daughter. What’s your idea about this?
5737	273	3	44	zh-TW	我在台灣已經待5年了，我有居留證號碼，而且我非常喜歡這個地方。目前為止，我沒有要離開台灣的打算。我也覺得我的小孩有需要見到父母。我要強調，雖然我跟我太太現在在打離婚官司，但我從來沒想過要切斷他與我女兒的聯繫。在打離婚官司的過程中，我有寄我女兒的照片給我太太，我還邀請…
5738	273	3	45	en-US	So you mean in the short term, you do not plan to go back to your country?
5739	273	3	46	zh-TW	也許吧。因為我母親已經非常老而且生病了。即使我回去了，我也不會留太久。我也沒想過我要把女兒一起帶回去。
5740	273	3	47	en-US	Now we want to ask the relative party about some questions. You do not live with your husband?
5741	273	3	48	en-US	Yes, we have not lived together for six months.
5742	273	3	49	en-US	So when do you suit the divorce case?
5743	273	3	50	en-US	About two months ago.
5744	273	3	51	en-US	So before you suit the divorce case, you do not live together?
5745	273	3	52	en-US	Yes.
5746	273	3	53	en-US	So who do you live with now?
5747	273	3	54	en-US	I live with my son with my first marriage.
5748	273	3	55	en-US	First marriage? So what’s the…
5749	273	3	56	en-US	He is my second husband.
5750	273	3	57	en-US	So about the child rearing rights, it’s about the daughter with your second husband?
5751	273	3	58	en-US	Yes.
5752	273	3	59	en-US	How old is your son? And your daughter?
5753	273	3	60	en-US	My son is seven years old and my daughter is six months old.
5754	273	3	61	en-US	When you move out, does your daughter live with you or your husband?
5755	273	3	62	en-US	When I move out, my daughter was only two months old, and she needs me, so she lived with me then.
5756	273	3	63	en-US	So where did the daughter live with?
5757	273	3	64	en-US	Now my daughter lives with my husband.
5758	273	3	65	en-US	Is there any agreement between your husband and you? Why does your daughter live with your husband instead of you?
5759	273	3	66	en-US	After I move out, the place I live is smaller than the place that my husband lives. For living environment, it will be better for my child, so I let my daughter live with my husband.
5760	273	3	67	en-US	So if the objective circumstances, that is, the living environment, does not change, it’s still not good for your daughter, isn’t it? So why do you strive for the custody?
5761	273	3	68	en-US	She is my daughter, and I cannot see her. My husband is a Canadian, and his job in Taiwan is not so fixed, he may go back to Canada anytime. Then, in that case, I will not see my daughter forever. So I hope I can strive for the rearing rights for my daughter.
5762	273	3	69	en-US	For your financial status, how will you afford the raising…?
5763	273	3	70	en-US	Now we are still in the divorce case. I hope I can strive for the rights that I can live in the house that my husband lives now. So for the living environment, that house will be good for my daughter. As for my financial status, I have offered my asset list for the court. Besides, I have the fixed job, that I can get NT$40000 per month. I believe I can raise and take care of my daughter.
5764	273	3	71	en-US	So how is your divorce case? When will the divorce case have the result?
5765	273	3	72	en-US	I’m not so sure. We will be in court this Friday. I will express to the judge of the divorce case that the decision can be given as soon as possible.
5766	273	3	73	en-US	So the court will send the social workers to visit both of you, and will make the evaluation for how you interact with your daughter. We will make some decision according to the social workers’ report. Before that, I would like to ask will both of you consider the shared custody? Shared custody means that the daughter will live with the husband sometime and live with mother some time.
5767	273	3	74	zh-TW	我並不太贊成這個安排，因為我的女兒還太小，他只有8個月大，我不想讓他在我跟我太太之間傳來傳去的。對一個這麼小的小孩來說，如果讓他跟爸爸住一段時間，又讓他跟媽媽住一段時間，這樣會讓他感到非常混亂。
5768	273	3	75	en-US	I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small, it is not suitable for this arrangement.
5769	273	3	76	en-US	Ok, we will go through the process of social workers’ visitation. After they do the report, we will set the next court date. Then we will make both of you have the opportunity to state.
5770	273	3	77	zh-TW	好，我同意這個安排。

5796	281	3	31	zh-TW	我也有請律師
5797	281	3	32	en-US	Today my major concern is to clarify your will on child custody. I also concerned with why both of you consider yourself fully capable for the sole custody. Please elaborate your view. Beside the child rearing case, I know you’re also up with a divorce case. So I hope there won’t be any verbal attacks in the court.
5798	281	3	33	zh-TW	我瞭解了
5799	281	3	34	en-US	I understand
5800	281	3	35	en-US	Let me ask you a few question. Plaintiff, why do you want to get the sole custody of your child? Far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan for the time being. And you’re also a foreigner. In fighting for the child rearing right, why do you think you’re more capable? 
5801	281	3	36	zh-TW	我希望能得到我女兒的全部撫養權, 而我有兩個理由. 首先我太太已經沒和我們住在一起了, 我希望能陪伴我女兒成長. 再來我聽說我老婆和另一個男的同居了, 如果這事情是真的, 那我懷疑她可以帶給我們女幸福, 因此我希望能有全部撫養權
5802	281	3	37	en-US	You mean because your wife is still up with a divorce case with you, but she no longer live with you, is that right? Moreover, you think she’s living with another man. Regarding this situation that’s why you don’t want to share custody with your wife, is that right?
5803	281	3	38	zh-TW	對, 這都是我的考量
5804	281	3	39	en-US	Other than that, concerning your financial status, how are you going to raise your daughter? 
5805	281	3	40	zh-TW	確實我現在沒有一份全職的工作, 但是我有兼任好幾份工作並提供我穩定的工作, 我相信我的收入能夠提供我和我女兒足夠的金額
5806	281	3	41	en-US	You mentioned you have several part-time jobs, since all of them are part-time jobs, can you make an evaluation about how much exactly you make each month?
5807	281	3	42	zh-TW	平均來說我大概有四五份兼職工作, 全部加起來的話一個月大概能賺五萬塊有時如果有接到新案子的話可以賺更多錢
5808	281	3	43	en-US	And another question, after you get the sole custody of your child, will you take her to Canada and do not return? The reason why I’m asking this question that even if you get the sole custody, your wife still have the visitation right. So if you take your daughter back to Canada, it means that you’re cutting the tie between your wife and daughter. What do you think about that?
5809	281	3	44	zh-TW	我已經在台灣住了五年, 我有這邊的居留權, 我也很喜歡這邊, 目前我並沒有離開台灣的計畫, 特別是我相信我女兒應該有權力能見到她的父母, 我要強調的是雖然我和我太太在打離婚官司, 但我並沒有打算切斷她們母女倆的聯繫, 在離婚官司的過程中我都會寄女兒的照片給她, 我甚至會安排時間為我們大家見面. 
5810	281	3	45	en-US	You mean you don’t have any plan to return to Canada at the moment?
5811	281	3	46	zh-TW	不, 我回加拿大的原因只有可能是我媽老了病了. 就算如此我回去也不會停留太久, 我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒一起去
5812	281	3	47	en-US	Now I’m going to ask your wife some questions. You no longer live with your husband is that true?
5813	281	3	48	en-US	Yes we’ve been parting for six months already.
5814	281	3	49	en-US	So when did you file the divorce case?
5815	281	3	50	en-US	Well, about two month ago.
5816	281	3	51	en-US	So that means, before you file the divorce, you no longer live together right?
5817	281	3	52	en-US	Yes
5818	281	3	53	en-US	So what is your living condition at the moment? Who do you live with?
5819	281	3	54	en-US	I’m living with my son from my first marriage. 
5820	281	3	55	en-US	First marriage? So what marriage are we talking here?
5821	281	3	56	en-US	He’s my second husband.
5822	281	3	57	en-US	So the child rearing case is about your second child, which is your daughter
5823	281	3	58	en-US	Yes
5824	281	3	59	en-US	How old is your son, and how old is your daughter?
5825	281	3	60	en-US	My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.
5826	281	3	61	en-US	After you move out, did your daughter live with you or your husband?
5827	281	3	62	en-US	After I moved out, my daughter was just two months old, so she still needs me, and live with me.
5828	281	3	63	en-US	What about now? Who does the child live with
5829	281	3	64	en-US	Now my daughter lives with my husband.
5830	281	3	65	en-US	Did you have any agreement? Why did she live with you at first, and now with your husband?
5831	281	3	66	en-US	After I move out, I live in a smaller place, so my husband has a bigger place. The environment is better, so I think she’s better off with my husband.
5832	281	3	67	en-US	Regardless of the objective circumstances, that’s still not…. Is that better for your daughter? So why do you want to get the sole custody of your daughter?
5833	281	3	68	en-US	After all, I’ve had her pregnant for ten months, she’s still my daughter. Besides, my husband is Canadian, and he doesn’t hold a stable job. In this concern, I may never see my daughter again. That’s why I want to get my daughter’s sole custody.
5834	281	3	69	en-US	As for your financial status, can you elaborate how are you going to raise your daughter?
5835	281	3	70	en-US	So far, we’re still up with the divorce case. I’m fighting for the right to live in my husband’s place after the divorce case. Based on the environment, I think my husband’s place would be suitable for my daughter’s growing up. As for my financial status, I’ve provided an asset list for the court. And I also have a job with an income of 40000 NT a month. So I think I’m capable of raising my daughter.
5836	281	3	71	en-US	So may I ask how is your divorce case proceeding? Do you know when will the court’s decision be made?
5837	281	3	72	en-US	I’m not sure, we will be in another court this Friday. I will ask the judge of the divorce case to come up with a court decision as soon as possible.
5838	281	3	73	en-US	How about we send a social worker to see both of you? So the social worker will make an evaluation based on how you interact with your daughter. We will take that evaluation as reference to see what works the best for your daughter. But before that, have you come to think about share custody? Basically, share custody is to have your daughter spend a certain amount of time with her father, and a certain amount of time with her mother.
5839	281	3	74	zh-TW	我個人是不太贊同這種作法, 因為我女兒還太小, 她才八個月大, 我不希望她經歷我和我太太之間的流離失所, 對這麼小的小孩來說, 讓她以這種方式長大的話她會很困惑
5840	281	3	75	en-US	On this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too little, she’s not suitable for a share custody.
5841	281	3	76	en-US	Ok, if that’s the case, we’ll first arrange a social worker to see how it goes. After there’s a result, we’ll arrange the next court time. And that both parties have the chance to elaborate.

Before that, the court would like to make sure that have you ever considered to share the custody? The shared custody means the child will live with the father for some time, and live with the mother for some time.
5911	289	3	74	zh-TW	我個人不太考慮這一點，因為我女兒還太小。他只有八個月大而已。我不想要他跟經歷我和太太的離異過程。對一個那麼小的小孩來講，可能會造成他認知上的混淆，如果他必須跟他的父親住一段時間，又再去跟母親住一段時間的話。
5912	289	3	75	en-US	As to this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young to arrange this way at such a young age.

8209	288	4	76	en-US	Even if it was gold hidden inside that bag, it would still violate the law set by Taiwan.
8210	288	4	77	zh-TW	我只知道黃金在泰國比較便宜，我不知道把黃金帶進台灣是不是違法的。
8211	288	4	78	en-US	Why do you think that it would be no problem for you to bring gold into Taiwan?
8212	288	4	79	zh-TW	黃金就是黃金，不會有什麼大問題，不是嗎？

8250	83	5	28	en-US	do you fully understand your 
8251	83	5	29	zh-TW	是我了解了
8252	83	5	30	en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for adultery. The plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case of today. It’s mainly because her husband John Anderson has an intimate relation with one of the teacher in the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. Plus, the defendant usually tends to go home late and has close relation with Tsai Yen Wang in the cram school and even had video telephoning. The plaintiff found that everything proves that her husband and his coworker are actually beyond coworker’s relationship. That’s why the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, your wife suspects you of committing adultery. What’s your plea?
8253	83	5	31	zh-TW	當然無罪啊
8254	83	5	32	en-US	For today’s preparatory procedure, we are mainly here for the contents of those intimate messages. In order to figure out whether the defendant really has adultery with his coworker. Do both parties understand the procedures?
8255	83	5	33	en-US	Yes, I understand.
8256	83	5	34	zh-TW	我明白
8257	83	5	35	en-US	I have questions for the plaintiff. How long have you been married to your husband? Do you have any children?
8258	83	5	36	en-US	My husband and I have married for four years and we don’t have any children.
8259	83	5	37	en-US	Did you and your husband get married in Taiwan or abroad?
8260	83	5	38	en-US	We met in Taiwan. Four years ago he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
8261	83	5	39	en-US	So in the past few years, your husband’s work in Taiwan was teaching Portuguese?
8262	83	5	40	en-US	Well, when we just met he was an Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued to teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular foreign language to learn in Taiwan so his teaching hours were quite unstable. Sometimes he might have a period between jobs. This period can be long to a month. Afterwards, in order to make his income more stable, he started to teach English. But because his mother tongue is not English, he decides to seek an advanced degree.
8263	83	5	41	en-US	You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. Does this mean a degree in Taiwan?
8264	83	5	42	en-US	No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan so that degree must be related to English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California for teaching English. He doesn’t have to go to America but still can have the courses by on-line learning. In this case, after he finishes all the courses he can get a master degree. His plan is through this degree he got from the United States he can get a job in Taiwan.
8265	83	5	43	en-US	What’s his relationship with this woman that he commits the adultery?
8266	83	5	44	en-US	They are colleagues in cram school. The cram school arranges he to partner with somebody, a Taiwanese, and that woman was his partner. 
8267	83	5	45	en-US	How did you know that they have adultery?
8268	83	5	46	en-US	At first I just found out that my husband stayed quite long after work in the cram school. I have asked him several times that it’s just an English cram school, why did you need to stay so long after work in the cram school? He told me that because he had to partner with a Taiwanese so that they needed a lot of time to communicate and discuss about the course. At the very beginning, I really didn’t suspect him of anything. After I found out he got some phone calls quite often after work and when he received the call, he couldn’t speak in front of me. He always went to the study room. It started to make me curious so I began to check his phone.
8269	83	5	47	en-US	Did you find anything unusual in his cellphone?
8270	83	5	48	en-US	I saw that in his phone book I saw a number quite often. Because of that, I was curious again and started to check his messages. After the checking I found that he had messages of the same woman every day.
8271	83	5	49	en-US	They are just some messages, or are there any problems with the messages?
8272	83	5	50	en-US	If they are just some normal messages then it’s okay. But he’s a married man, how could he receive some intimate messages from others. Before, I did offer some contents of the messages to the court. They should already been included in the documents. 
8273	83	5	51	en-US	Please show the evidence record, page number 13. There are few messages. Please the defendant have a look. Are these messages from your phone?
8274	83	5	52	zh-TW	對，這是我手機裡的簡訊
8275	83	5	53	en-US	I have few questions concerning these messages for you. The first message was at 9:50 on the date 31st November in 2002 from the cellphone number 0958932xxx. The contents were “I really miss you my love.” What did that mean?
8276	83	5	54	zh-TW	喔，這只是我一個同事傳給我的，我記得我那時候大概放了兩天假吧，她大概是有點擔心，這就是為什麼她傳給我這封簡訊啊。我的同事她在美國受教育所以她算是心胸鰻寬闊的，這就是她說話的方式還有自我表現的方式。至於「my love」這個字，只是用來稱呼一些我們關心的人
8277	83	5	55	en-US	Did you mean that because this colleague has spent some time in the united states, her thought was kind of westernized and her way of expressing herself was quite open as well. So “my love” means nothing special, is that right?
8278	83	5	56	zh-TW	不是，這只是一個很平常的稱呼而已，就是用來稱呼我們在乎的人。
8279	83	5	57	en-US	what about the sentence before
8280	83	5	58	zh-TW	我剛剛講過了，她很擔心我，我們是工作上面的同事，當我沒去工作兩天，她當然會想我啊。
8281	83	5	59	en-US	Do you mean she’s just because you hadn’t been to work for two days, that’s why she sent you this message; because without your assistance in the class so she misses you? Is that all?
8282	83	5	60	zh-TW	對，這就是簡訊的內容，這沒有什麼大不了的。
8283	83	5	61	en-US	The second text was at 11:55pm on 13rd January in 2003. This message was from the same number as the first one. The content was “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together我希望你在我身邊 我們什麼時候才能真正在一起呢”. What does this message mean? Why is it possible to have this kind of contexts?
8284	83	5	62	zh-TW	她寫給我這句話是因為想告訴我一個課本上面出現的句子。
8285	83	5	63	en-US	Do you mean she send you this message because she wants you help from the text book? What does that mean?
8286	83	5	64	zh-TW	因為我太太幫我申請這個課程，所以我有一個線上教學的課程。在這個課程裡我需要修滿30個學分才可以拿到學位。當然我會需要完成一些練習啊，還有作業。
8287	83	5	65	en-US	Can you please explain what’s your master degree about?
8288	83	5	66	zh-TW	我的課程是英語教學，這個課程裡爸都是跟英語教學有關的，但有些其他課程是跟文化還有語言能力相關。
8289	83	5	67	en-US	So the master degree is mainly about English teaching but there are some courses about language competence and culture, is that right?
8290	83	5	68	zh-TW	對，我記得大概有三門課都和文化還有溝通相關吧。
8291	83	5	69	en-US	So how do the courses related to communication? What kind of assignments they gave you?
8292	83	5	70	zh-TW	關於文化與溝通的作業呢，針對每個學生都是不一樣的，以我自己為例，我是一個在台灣想獲得英語教學資格的人，為了達成這個要求，我需要符合一些資格，必須要具備一定的中文能力，所以我有一些作業都是中文和英語之間的翻譯。
8293	83	5	71	en-US	you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan so you have to prove yourself with enough Chinese competence, is that right? Thus, you have to finish some assignments from the course and these assignments are translation between English and Chinese. Is that true?
8294	83	5	72	zh-TW	對，就是這樣，我真的很想增進自己的寫作能力還有說的能力。
8295	83	5	73	en-US	Let’s go back to what we discussed before that it’s your assignment right?
8296	83	5	74	zh-TW	對，我記得這個句子啊，當我拿到這個中文句子的時候，我實在不知道怎麼樣用英文表達，你們都知道吧，有些中文字對外國人來說真的很難。我需要一些幫助，所以像我同事求救，我請她翻譯這個句子然後用簡訊傳給我。
8297	83	5	75	en-US	You meant that you sent her the Chinese sentence and she sent you back the English translation of that sentence. So this message was just the answer for your assignments?
8298	83	5	76	zh-TW	對，這封簡訊就只是我作業的答案而已。
8299	83	5	77	en-US	Again, let’s have a look at the record from page 14 to 16. Here are some contents of the messages. Please have a careful look at the contents. Were all of these the answers of your assignments so that she sent you these messages?
8300	83	5	78	zh-TW	對，全部的簡訊都是我作業的答案。
8301	83	5	79	en-US	what’s your explanation for your wife’s suspect of you having adultery with your colleague Tsai yen Wang?
8302	83	5	80	zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了啦，我知道她對我對這個家的貢獻不太滿意，我希望庭上了解，在我開始修這個遠距課程的時候，她就沒有提供我任何課業上的幫助，她根本一點都不想幫我完成這個學位，如果她當初願意多幫助我一些，我就不用像我同事尋求協助啦，我覺得他應該要為這一切、這個事件負責。
8303	83	5	81	en-US	According to you saying, it seems that you and your wife are not getting along too well, right?
8304	83	5	82	zh-TW	在我們一開始結婚的時候，的確是處的蠻不錯的，但問題是在於我失業了，剛我想在台灣教葡萄牙語但工作時數很不穩定，所以我工作的問題就變成我們倆爭執的來源，我們常常為了這個問題吵架，她不相信我已經盡力了，我實在無法讓她了解我現在這個時期有多痛苦多難熬。
8305	83	5	83	en-US	Let’s go back to the master degree we just discussed. When did you start the master degree? Has it ended already? When will you get the degree?
8306	83	5	84	zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始上這個課，這個課程是兩年制，我應該要在2012年年底完成。我沒有辦法完成這個學位，因為我一邊上課一邊工作，沒有時間完成所有的作業。我剛剛前面有說過了，我太太完全不想幫忙，我覺得我好像一個人孤身奮戰想取得這個學位，我變得很累而且很沮喪。
8307	83	5	85	en-US	You mean that it’s a two-year course but you didn’t finish it at the end. Why?
8308	83	5	86	zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有課程的要求。
8309	83	5	87	en-US	When did you last register for the courses? When will it end?
8310	83	5	88	zh-TW	上一次註冊的課程是在2012年秋季班。
8311	83	5	89	en-US	According to what you just mentioned, the last day of your course will be December 5th, 2012 so after that you shouldn’t have any more assignments right? But the messages were actually six months after the course ended. What’s your explanation?
8312	83	5	90	zh-TW	我可能的確是沒有完成這個課程啦，但這不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。即使我沒有辦法取得學位，但我持續想精進我的中文能力，這就是為什麼我還是繼續練習啊
8313	83	5	91	en-US	You what you meant is that even you couldn’t get the degree, you still want to continue learning Chinese to make it become more fluent. Is that right?
8314	83	5	92	zh-TW	對，這就是我向我同事尋求協助的原因
8315	83	5	93	en-US	So your colleague is actually serving as a tutor for you right?
8316	83	5	94	zh-TW	她不只是像一個家教還是一個真正的朋友
8317	83	5	95	en-US	Did you pay her?
8318	83	5	96	zh-TW	我曾經想付錢給她，但她拒絕了
8319	83	5	97	en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why did she need to send you messages that it’s the time that she should already fall into sleep? Wasn’t that beyond what a colleague should do?
8320	83	5	98	zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個真的想幫忙我的朋友啊，她用她自己的時間來幫我學習中文。
8321	83	5	99	en-US	Are you still at the same cram school teaching English?
8322	83	5	100	zh-TW	對 我還在那裏工作
8323	83	5	101	en-US	What about the colleague Tsai yen Wang? Is she still there?
8324	83	5	102	zh-TW	對，她還在這家補習班任職，但是我們不再是搭檔了
8325	83	5	103	en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any further evidence to investigate?
8326	83	5	104	en-US	I want to subpoena Tsai yen Wang who teaches in Powen cram school to come to the court to give us some information. I would like her to clarify her relationship with the defendant and the background of writing all these messages.

8425	91	5	98	zh-TW	所以我就說她是一個一個很支持我的朋友。她都用她自己的時間來幫我學中文。
8426	91	5	99	en-US	Do you still teach english in that cram school?
8427	91	5	100	zh-TW	對我還在那邊工作。

8513	99	5	81	en-US	According to your statement, there seems to be some unhappy things between you and your wife?
8514	99	5	82	zh-TW	剛結婚的時候 真的很開心 但是問題是我的工作 我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文 可是卻沒有辦法獲得足夠的工作時數 所以我的工作就變成我們兩個之間的問題 我們為此一直吵架 他不相信我有努力 而且他對於我的挫折還有困境完全不了解

8522	99	5	90	zh-TW	我沒有完成學位也不代表我不想增進我的語文能力阿 就算我沒有拿到學位我也想要增進我的中文 所以我還是自己繼續念
8523	99	5	91	en-US	You mean despite the failing of the course, you still wanted to improve your Chinese ability, right?

8539	99	5	107	en-US	Defendant, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? The situation now is that your master program has ended, so it should not be taken as an excuse for the interaction between you and Wang Tsai-Yen. Especially, your interaction was always after 9pm, I think it suspectful. Do you have any evidence that may help you with your case?
8540	99	5	108	zh-TW	我想不出法院可以幫我偵查什麼耶 就像我之前說的 我們之間的互動是很單純的 我只是想要增進我的語言能力繼續學中文

8575	107	5	38	en-US	 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.
8576	107	5	39	en-US	Is his job teaching Portuguese for past years?
8577	107	5	40	en-US	The time we just met, he was a Portuguese teacher. And he still kept teaching Portuguese when we just married. But there’s not many people want to learn Portuguese so his teaching hours was not stable. Sometime the period between jobs would be one or two months. To make the income more stable, he started to teach English. But English is not his mother tongue, he decided to take an advanced degree.
8578	107	5	41	en-US	You just mentioned he wanted to seek an advanced degree, is that mean he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?
8579	107	5	42	en-US	No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he need to get a TESOL degree. He found a distance learning from California, U.S. so that he doesn’t need to go to California, U.S. but get the degree by the distance learning program. His plan is to get the English teacher job by the American degree.

8581	107	5	44	en-US	They are co-workers in cram school. They are partner. One is foreign teacher, one is mandarin teacher. The person he has an affair with is the mandarin teacher.
8582	107	5	45	en-US	How do you know that they have an affair?
8583	107	5	46	en-US	In the beginning, I just noticed my husband stayed in cram school over-time. I asked him for several times why have to work over-time in English cram school? He told me that he had to communicate with his partner. I didn’t doubt him at the beginning. But I found that he sometimes had some call after he finish his job. He didn’t talk in front of me. He would talk in his study room. That made me start doubting so I went check his phone
8584	107	5	47	en-US	What’s the unusual in his cellphone?
8585	107	5	48	en-US	There are usually the same number shows up in his phone book. I was so curious so I go check his messages. And I found out that he message with a woman every day.
8586	107	5	49	en-US	I don’t think text messages matter. Was there any unusual content?
8587	107	5	50	en-US	If that just usual message, that is okay. But he is married, how can he have intimate messages with another woman? I’ve provided some text messages and I think it’s in the file.
8588	107	5	51	en-US	In the file one, page thirteen. Here are some message content for the defendant. Are those the messages in your phone?

8591	107	5	54	zh-TW	這是我同事傳給我的啊。我記得我那時候休了兩天假，她那時有點焦慮。所以她才發給我這樣的簡訊。我同事是在美國念過書所以她很開放，那是她表達的方式。至於我的愛這句話，這是我們稱呼我們所在乎的人的方式。
8592	107	5	55	en-US	You mean she text you because she was westernized for being educated in U.S.? She is more open minded to express, so “my love” doesn’t mean any special?
8593	107	5	56	zh-TW	沒啊這就只是好朋友老朋友之間互相表達我們很在乎對方。
8594	107	5	57	en-US	How about former sentence?
8595	107	5	58	zh-TW	就像我講的 她有點擔心，因為我們是工作上的搭檔啊。當我兩天沒上班她當然會想念我。
8596	107	5	59	en-US	You mean you text you that kind of message just because you had two days off? She missed you because of without you in the class? Just that
8597	107	5	60	zh-TW	對啊就只是這樣啊。對啊就跟內容講的一樣啊這根本就沒甚麼。
8598	107	5	61	en-US	The second message is at 23:55 PM, January thirteenth, 2013, from the same number to your phone. The content is “我真的好希望你在我身邊，為什麼我們不能真正的在一起?” What does that mean? Why the content?
8599	107	5	62	zh-TW	她之所以會傳給我這樣的簡訊主要是為了表達中文句子。這是我的作業。
8600	107	5	63	en-US	You mean she text you the message just for helping you the assignment? What does that mean?
8601	107	5	64	zh-TW	就像我老婆告訴庭上的。我開始了這個遠距教學程，在這遠距教學課程裡我得完成30個學分。自然，我需要完成一些功課與習題。
8602	107	5	65	zh-TW	Can you explain what is your master degree for?
8603	107	5	66	en-US	我的課程主要是英語教學。在課程裡，大部分是英語教學的部分，其他則是文化及語言能力相關。
8604	107	5	67	en-US	So you mean you get the TESOL degree, but there’re some courses about cross-culture communication?
8605	107	5	68	zh-TW	我記得大概有三棵是關於跨文化溝通課程。
8606	107	5	69	en-US	What’s the assignment in cross-culture communication courses?
8607	107	5	70	zh-TW	每個學生的作業都不太一樣，拿我舉例來說，我人在台灣，尋求教師資格，為了顯示我有這個這個能力勝任教師，所以有很多是關於中英語句的翻譯轉換。
8608	107	5	71	en-US	You mean to get the degree you have to prove that you have Chinese competence, so you have to complete the assignment in the course. And the assignment is to translate sentences? Is that right?
8609	107	5	72	zh-TW	對啊當然，而且我還得加強我的說和寫的能力。
8610	107	5	73	en-US	Okay let’s back to the former sentence, you said that is your assignment?
8611	107	5	74	zh-TW	對啊我還記得那句，當我知道中文句子時，我不知道如何變成英文。你懂的，有些中文對外國人而言實在很難分辨差別。我實在需要幫忙所以我找了我的同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯並傳簡訊給我。
8612	107	5	75	en-US	Your mean you told your colleague that Chinese sentence so she text it into English and send it to you? That’s only the answer to your assignment
8613	107	5	76	zh-TW	那封簡訊就真的只是作業的答案而已。
8614	107	5	77	en-US	Messages in file one, page 14 to 16. Please have a look. Are those message also the help for your assignment?
8615	107	5	78	zh-TW	是的所有簡訊都是為了完成我的作業。
8616	107	5	79	en-US	So what’s your explanation for your wife said that you have an affair with your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang?
8617	107	5	80	zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了。我知道她對於我對家計的幫助一直很不滿意。我必須告訴庭上，從一開始修這門課，她就沒表現任何想支持我的意思。她根本就不想幫助我完成這個學位，如果她表現出她有點想幫助我的樣子，我就不會想請我同事幫助我。我覺得這一切的誤會都得怪她。
8618	107	5	81	en-US	As you just said, there are some unhappy between you and your wife?
8619	107	5	82	zh-TW	一開始我們剛結婚時的確還滿快樂的，但問題在於我的工作。我試著在台灣交葡萄牙語但我的工時實在太不穩定了。所以我的工作成為我們的大問題，我們為了這個問題一直爭吵，她一直不相信我的努力。我也沒辦法讓她明白我的艱困處境及我的沮喪。
8620	107	5	83	en-US	Okay, let’s back to the degree issue. When did your advanced degree start? Did that finished? Did you get the degree?
8621	107	5	84	zh-TW	我大概是2010年春天開始的，這是兩年期的課程。我應該在2012年的12月完成這門課程。但我並沒有如期完成因為我有兼職要做而且我也沒有完成這門課的作業。就像我講的，我老婆一點都不想幫
8622	107	5	85	en-US	You said that program is for two years, but you didn’t complete, why?
8623	107	5	86	zh-TW	我無法完成所有課程的要求。
8624	107	5	87	en-US	When does the last semester you registered complete?
8625	107	5	88	zh-TW	我註冊在學的最後一個學期事2012年的秋季。

8627	107	5	90	zh-TW	我雖然沒有完成這門課程，但不代表我就不想精進我的語言能力。就算我沒有得到我的學位，我還是想要我的中文能力進步，所以我持續自行學習。
8628	107	5	91	en-US	You mean though you didn’t complete the degree, you still want to improve your language competence to make your Chinese more fluently?
8629	107	5	92	zh-TW	是的這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫我。
8630	107	5	93	en-US	So the position that your colleague is your tutor?
8631	107	5	94	zh-TW	她不僅是家教也是我的好朋友。
8632	107	5	95	en-US	Did you pay her?
8633	107	5	96	zh-TW	沒有啊我原本想付錢給她但她拒絕了。
8634	107	5	97	en-US	If you didn’t pay her why she still text you in midnight the bed time for answering your questions? Don’t you think that is beyond the co-worker relationship
8635	107	5	98	zh-TW	就像我剛剛講過的，她是一個非常支持我的好朋友。她用她自己的時間幫助我學中文。
8636	107	5	99	en-US	Do you still work in that cram school?
8637	107	5	100	zh-TW	是的我仍在那邊任教。
8638	107	5	101	en-US	Is the co-worker, Tsai-Yen Wang still working there, too?
8639	107	5	102	zh-TW	她仍在那邊工作但我們不再是搭檔了。
8640	107	5	103	en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any person you want to subpoena or investigate any further evidence?
8641	107	5	104	en-US	I want to subpoena Tsai-Yen Wang, who was the co-worker in BoYuan cram school to clarify the relationship between the defendant and those messages. 
8642	107	5	105	en-US	Plaintiff, do you want the court to investigate for you
8643	107	5	106	en-US	 I’ve heard that cram school took some action for the relationship between my husband and her. Also I heard the cram school tried to persuade Tsai-Yen Wang to quit. Can we modify it from the cram school?
8644	107	5	107	en-US	 Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you? The situation is, your degree finished on December fifth, 2012. You don’t have any reason to explain the intimate messages between you and Miss Wang. Especially, the message communication is mainly after 9PM, it’s very doubtful. Do you have any evidence which can help you?
8645	107	5	108	zh-TW	我覺得我的行為已經夠可以表現出我的清白了。就像我說的，我跟我同事間的簡訊來往是非常單純的。我只是想增進我的中文能力並持續的學中文。

8801	123	5	54	zh-TW	恩這是我一個同事傳給我的，我記得我那時請了兩天的假，她有點擔心我的狀況，所以她才傳給我這個簡訊。我同事在美國讀過書所以她也比較開放。她就是這樣子講話來表達自己的情感的。至於那句”my love”，那只是我們叫彼此之間的方式罷了。
8802	123	5	55	en-US	Do you mean that because your co-work has ever received education in America so she might be westernized? So…she might be open-mind to express her thoughts? So, as to “my love”, there isn’t any meaning behind it?

8804	123	5	57	en-US	How about the prior sentence? 
8805	123	5	58	zh-TW	就像我剛剛說的啊，她很擔心我，我們又是工作上的搭檔。當我請了兩天的假，她當然會很想我啊。

8817	123	5	70	zh-TW	文化溝通課程的作業是因人而異的，舉我的例子來說，我在台灣然後我又想當一位英文老師，為了成為英文老師，我必須有足夠的中文能力，因此我的作業大多是和中英文翻譯有關。
8818	123	5	71	en-US	Do you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, this program ask you to show the good Chinese competence? As a result, you have to finish the assignments given by the program, and the assignments are about translations.

8822	123	5	75	en-US	Because you ask your co-worker to translate, she sent you the Chinese answer. Is this what you mean? That is to say, the message is only the answer to the assignment, do you mean this?

8828	123	5	81	en-US	According to what you just say, it seems that there are some unpleasant relationship between you and your wife?
8829	123	5	82	zh-TW	我們剛結婚時，我們的確過得很愉快，但問題在於我的工作，我想在台灣教葡萄牙語但是工作卻不穩定，於是，我的工作問題成為我們兩個之間不佳關係的導火線，我們因為我工作的問題已經吵架很多次了。她不相信我已經盡力了，她也不能理解我所遇到的沮喪或是困難。
8830	123	5	83	en-US	So, let’s go back to the master degree you just mentioned. When did your master degree start, did your master degree finish, did you get the degree?
8831	123	5	84	zh-TW	我在2010年春天開始上這個課，這是兩年的課程，我應該在2012年12月得到學位，我沒有得到學位是因為我必須兼職而我沒有時間好好寫我得作業。就像我剛剛說的，我太太對我沒有很支持，我覺得我修這個課的時侯都只是靠自己的努力。我覺得很累也很難過。

8833	123	5	86	zh-TW	我沒辦法完成課程的要求。

But later I found he had some phone calls after he came home. He never answers the phone in front of my face. He just went to the study room to answer the phone call. What I said made me feel confused and I try to check his phone.

8934	131	5	82	zh-TW	在我們最一開始的婚姻時，我們確實有一段不錯的時光。但問題在於我的工作。 我嘗試在台灣教葡萄牙語維生但我沒辦法得到穩定的教學時數。所以我工作的問題變成我與我老婆之間的問題。我們時常針對這個問題吵架。她不信我已經盡了我的全力，我沒棒法讓她知道我所受的挫折以及我所處的困境

When he picked up the phone, he would not tell in front of me and choose to talk in his study room. This action makes some doubts on him and I started to check on his phone.

9011	139	5	54	zh-TW	這是從我一個同事發過來的，我記得他因為我休假想念我所以才發過來的。她有點擔心我，這就是為什麼他發簡訊給我。我同事在美國接受，她覺得這樣是很正常的，這就是她這樣表達自己想法。而這封簡訊”我很想念你的愛，這只是我們表達關心的方式。
9012	139	5	55	en-US	You just mention that she stayed in the States so her thought is more westernized, right? Her emotional expression is more deliberate, tight? So ,“My love” does not mean so much, right?

9014	139	5	57	en-US	How about the meaning she just mentioned before?
9015	139	5	58	zh-TW	就像我前面說的，她只是擔心我，而且我們只是工作上的同事。我這樣請假兩天，她擔然會擔心我啊。

9023	139	5	66	zh-TW	我的學位主要是有關英語教學。在這學位的課程之中，有些是關於英語教學，也有一部分文化有關，但是有些和語言能力有相關。
9024	139	5	67	en-US	You mean that your degree is about TESOL but there are some courses about culture communication, is that correct?

9049	139	5	92	zh-TW	那也就是為什麼我持續問我同事問題
9050	139	5	93	en-US	So, your colleague play role with tutor in your learning.
9051	139	5	94	zh-TW	他扮演不僅是家教而且要是很要好的朋友

9065	139	5	108	zh-TW	我覺得庭上好像沒辦法查到任何幫助我案情的證據。就像我剛才說的，我們之間傳簡訊的目的是非常單純的。這樣做只是為了完成語言能力和完成我的作業。

The contents between her husband and his colleague collected by the plaintiff was too intimate, and it’s beyond the normal colleague relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. Defendant, your wife doubt you that you have adultery with other women. What’s your plea?

9096	147	5	34	zh-TW	我了解。

9100	147	5	38	en-US	We met in Taiwan. He came to Taiwan four years ago. And at that time, he came to teach Portuguese.
9101	147	5	39	en-US	Has he taught Portuguese in the last (few) years?
9102	147	5	40	en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not really popular in Taiwan, so my husband’s working situation is not really stable. Further, sometimes he would have a period between jobs (which) lasts for month. Then, he wants to have a stable income. He started to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he wants to pursue advanced study
9103	147	5	41	en-US	You just said that that he wants to pursue advanced study, so does he want to get another degree in Taiwan?
9104	147	5	42	en-US	No. he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he needs to get a degree for English teaching. He found a distance program online from California. Consequently he doesn’t have to go to the United States. He can complete the program at home. After he finish(es) all the courses, he can get the degree. If he receives the degree from California, the US, then he would find a job of English teaching in Taiwan
9105	147	5	43	en-US	What’s his relationship with his colleague
9106	147	5	44	en-US	They are colleagues in the cram school. At that cram school, they assign a foreign teacher to match with another local teacher and that person is his partner.
9107	147	5	45	en-US	How do you know they two have intimate relationship?
9108	147	5	46	en-US	At first, I just noticed that my husband usually worked really late at cram school. I’ve asked him for many times. “It’s only a small cram school. Why would you need to work so late?” he told me that because we need to teach with another teacher at the same time, so we need to cooperate and need to discuss something. I didn’t doubt him at first. Later, he would receive some calls even when he arrived home. Further, he would answer the call not in front of me and he would go(es) back to his room to answer the call. This aroused my curiosity, so I checked his cellphone
9109	147	5	47	en-US	Do you see any abnormal message in his cellphone?
9110	147	5	48	en-US	I saw the same number calls him or he calls that number in his cellphone. So I checked his text messages. After that, I found out that, he sent messages with a woman almost every day.
9111	147	5	49	en-US	I think frequently texting with another person is quite normal. Is the message content abnormal ?
9112	147	5	50	en-US	 If the content is normal, I would not doubt him. However, he’s already married, how could he make others send him some intimate messages? I provided the contents of the text messages. I think all of them is (are) in the documents.
9113	147	5	51	en-US	Please see the Document One, page13. Defendant, here are some pieces of your text massages. Please check it. Are they the same (as) the ones in your cellphone?
9114	147	5	52	zh-TW	是的，它們和我手機裡的一樣。
9115	147	5	53	en-US	Then I would like to ask you some questions according to these messages. The first one is sent from the number 0958932*** at nine fifty p.m. on November 31st 2012. The content is I really miss you…(what do you mean by this sentence?)
9116	147	5	54	zh-TW	我記得我那時候休假了兩天。她有點擔心我。所以她才會發這則簡訊。我的同事是在美國受教育的所以她待人比較隨和， 所以她講話比較直接就像簡訊上那樣。「親愛的」只是我們稱呼自己在乎的人的方法。
9117	147	5	55	en-US	Do you mean that the person who sent you this message was educated in America, so she’s quite open-minded and westernized? Then she’s quite open to express her emotions and affections. Therefore, “my love” means nothing. Do you mean that?
9118	147	5	56	zh-TW	對阿，這就只是認識很久朋友互相的稱呼或是互相關心的人會這樣稱呼。
9119	147	5	57	en-US	How about another sentence?
9120	147	5	58	zh-TW	我說過了，她很擔心我。但我們就只是同事的關係。當我有兩天沒去上班的時候，她當然會想到我。
9121	147	5	59	en-US	Did you mean that she sent you this message just because you were two day off from work? Without your assistance and cooperation, so she missed you? Is that this simple?
9122	147	5	60	zh-TW	對阿就只是這樣而已，並沒有甚麼大不了的。
9123	147	5	61	en-US	Then, please check the second message. It’s from the same number at 11:55 p.m. on January 13th 2013. The content is something intimate, what does that mean? What does that mean by these lines?
9124	147	5	62	zh-TW	她寫這樣的訊息給我只是想要教我中文。
9125	147	5	63	en-US	You mean that she sent you this kind of messages to help you with your Chinese assignment?
9126	147	5	64	zh-TW	就像我太太先前說的，我正在唸一個學位。要完成學位我要在畢業前修完30個學分，那當然我需要做一些作業來拿到學分阿。
9127	147	5	65	en-US	Can you explain further for your master degree? What do you study for?
9128	147	5	66	zh-TW	我的學位是有關英語教學的。要完成這個學位，裡面有些關於教學的課程也有些關於中英語文能力的訓練。
9129	147	5	67	en-US	So you pursue for the English teaching mater degree; however there are still some further culture courses in that degree?
9130	147	5	68	zh-TW	是的，至少有三門課是跟文化和溝通相關的。
9131	147	5	69	en-US	You used the tem culture, so what would the teacher give you as assignments in the course?
9132	147	5	70	zh-TW	這門課的功課可能會因學生而異。像我自己的話，我來台灣然後想要找一個英語教學的教師職位，為了要達成這個目標然後顯現這個能力，所以我必須要有足夠的中文能力。因此我很多作業都是關於中英句子的翻譯。
9133	147	5	71	en-US	You mean that your goal is to teach English in Taiwan, so the course would ask you to proof your Chinese competence? Therefore, you had to complete some assignments and these assignments are about English and Chinese translation?
9134	147	5	72	zh-TW	當然阿，而且我還需要磨練我的口說和寫作技巧
9135	147	5	73	en-US	Okay, so you said that this message content was your assignment right?
9136	147	5	74	zh-TW	對阿，我還記得那個句子是甚麼。當我看到一個中文句子的時候我可能會不知道如何用英文來表達。你也知道吧，中文字有些時候對於外國人來說很難辨認阿，所以我需要別人的幫助，所以我就問我同事，我請她幫我翻譯然後請她把答案以簡訊寫給我。
9137	147	5	75	en-US	You mean that you ask your colleague this sentence in Chinese and she sent it back in English? Is this the situation? You mean that this message was just all about assignment?
9138	147	5	76	zh-TW	那則簡訊真的就只是作業答案而已啦。
9139	147	5	77	en-US	Then, how about the contents in Document One from page 14 to 16? Please check these messages. Are they all for your assignments? Just because you want your colleague to answer you in English?
9140	147	5	78	zh-TW	對，它們的目的都相同，就只是要幫我完成作業而已。
9141	147	5	79	en-US	Then how about the adultery between you and 王彩燕 from you wife?
9142	147	5	80	zh-TW	對於這件事我太太真的是想太多了。我知道她對於我可以照顧家庭的能力不滿意。我想讓您知道的是，從我開始念學位開始，她都很不支持，她甚至一點都不想要幫助我完成學位。如果她多幫我一點忙的話，我也不用問我同事啦，我想她應該要為這樣的誤解負責。
9143	147	5	81	en-US	According to your statement, you two don’t get along quite well?
9144	147	5	82	zh-TW	在婚姻初期我們是相處得滿愉快的。但她一直對我的工作有微詞。我也嘗試要教葡萄牙語來維生，但工作不穩定。所以我們有時候會為了這件事有口角，我們常為了這件事情不合，她都不相信我有努力找工作，我也很難讓她理解我有多沮喪和挫折。
9145	147	5	83	en-US	Let’s go back to the mater degree you mentioned. When did you start your master degree? When did you end it? Did you receive the degree?
9146	147	5	84	zh-TW	我是在2010的春季開始上課。它是一個兩年的課程，我應該要在2012的12月完成這個學業，但是我並沒如期完成，因為我有一些兼職，還要寫作業，這樣有點困難。就想我先前說的，我太太不太支持我，所以我會覺得我自己在念書的時候好像只有一個人在奮鬥，所以我相當疲憊跟挫折。
9147	147	5	85	en-US	You mean that it’s two-year-long program and you didn’t finish it, why?
9148	147	5	86	zh-TW	我無法達成每堂課的要求。
9149	147	5	87	en-US	When was(did) the last semester you registered end?
9150	147	5	88	zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋季班。
9151	147	5	89	en-US	If what you said I is true, and the last semester of your registration ended on December 5th 2012; then after that you would not have to contact your colleague for the assignment right? However, you two, you and your colleague, had been contacting with each other for over six months after that.
9152	147	5	90	zh-TW	我可能真的無法完成學業，但並不代表我不想學習阿。雖然我無法完成學業，但我想持續精進中文，所以才會繼續和她聯絡。
9153	147	5	91	en-US	You mean that even that you didn’t complete your degree, you still want to sharpen your Chinese by your own?
9154	147	5	92	zh-TW	是的，這就是我繼續和我同事尋求協助的原因。
9155	147	5	93	en-US	Your colleague is just like your tutor right?
9156	147	5	94	zh-TW	她不只是家教的角色她還是我真心的朋友。
9157	147	5	95	en-US	Did you pay her?
9158	147	5	96	zh-TW	沒有，我曾經有提過，但她拒絕了。
9159	147	5	97	en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why would she like to teach you Chinese so late at night, even it’s time for bed? Is it beyond the normal relationships between colleagues?
9160	147	5	98	zh-TW	我說過啦，她是一個很好的朋友，很支持我。她用她自己私人的時間來教我中文。
9161	147	5	99	en-US	Do you still teach at that cram school?
9162	147	5	100	zh-TW	是的，我還在那裏工作。
9163	147	5	101	en-US	Does 王彩燕 also work there till now?

9432	171	5	55	en-US	You mean that because the person who text you is educated in the United States, she is westernized.And the way she expressed herself is more openSo “my love” doesn’t mean anything special, right?

9520	179	5	38	en-US	i met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.
9521	179	5	39	en-US	So in the past few years, he works as a Portuguese teacher in Taiwan. Is that right?
9522	179	5	40	en-US	He was a Portuguese teacher when we met. After our marriage, he kept on being a Portuguese teacher. But since Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so he stopped teaching. Sometimes he didn’t work for one or two months. Later on, because he wanted to have a stable income, he started to teach English. Because his mother tongue is not English, he seeked an advanced degree.
9523	179	5	41	en-US	You just mentioned he’s seeking an advanced degree, so he decided to study in Taiwan?
9524	179	5	42	en-US	No. he hopes to teach English in Taiwan. What he really wants to obtain is an TESOL degree. He found a distance learning program in California online. So that he wouldn’t have to go to the states in order to get the degree. He only has to get it through distance online learning. After the program, he will obtain the master degree. His plan is through this program of TESOL, he could find a job as an English teacher.
9525	179	5	43	en-US	So what’s the relationship between him and the person he has affair with?
9526	179	5	44	en-US	They’re colleague in the same cram school. The school arranged a system. They require a Chinese teacher to work with a foreign teacher, and she is his partner.
9527	179	5	45	en-US	How did you know their affair?
9528	179	5	46	en-US	At the very beginning, I noticed that he usually worked extra hours. I’ve asked him about this several times. It is a cram school. Why did he work that late? He told me that because he has a Chinese partner, he needs to negotiate some issues with her. At the very beginning, I trust him. Later on, I found that he often got some phone calls. He wouldn’t take them until he is away from me. Then I started to doubt everything, so I checked his phone book. 
9529	179	5	47	en-US	Is there anything weird you found?
9530	179	5	48	en-US	In his calling history, I usually saw the same number. Then I was curious about his messages. After that, I found he texted a girl almost every day.
9531	179	5	49	en-US	Even if they texted each other every day, is that really wrong? Or you found something wrong in their message content?
9532	179	5	50	en-US	If they were normal messages, I’ll just get through it. But he’s a married person, how can he receive intimate messages from a girl? Previously I have provided the court with some messages. They should be in the file.

9534	179	5	52	zh-TW	是的它們是
9535	179	5	53	en-US	I would like to ask some questions about the messages. The first one was sent on 9:50 PM, November, 31 in 2012, and it is from the number 0958-932. It wrote 我真的很想你 I really miss you. What’s your explanation?
9536	179	5	54	zh-TW	是我同事傳來的。我記得那時候我請了兩天假，他有點擔心。也就是為甚麼他傳這封簡訊給我，他在美國接受教育，所以她比較開放。這就是他講話的方式，至於我所說的「愛」，這就是我們關心別人的方式。
9537	179	5	55	en-US	Do you mean that the message sender was educated in the states, so her ideas were quite westernized. Then she was quite open-minded about expressing her love. So the word “our love” doesn’t mean too much. Is that right?
9538	179	5	56	zh-TW	當然啊，這在好朋友之間很平常，我們都是這麼說的。
9539	179	5	57	en-US	How about the last sentence?
9540	179	5	58	zh-TW	就像我說的，他有點擔心我，我們是工作上的搭檔耶。當我離開工作兩天，他當然會想我啊
9541	179	5	59	en-US	So do you mean that because you had two days off and away from work. So she’s worried. Without your assistance at work, so she misses you. That’s all?
9542	179	5	60	zh-TW	對啊，那就是當時的情境，整個簡訊並沒有甚麼大不了
9543	179	5	61	en-US	Then the second message that we’re showing is sent at 11:55 PM on 13, January on 2013. It’s also from the same number. The content is “I want to..我想要你在我身邊，我們甚麼時候可以真正在一起？” can you tell me why she wrote like this?
9544	179	5	62	zh-TW	他寫這封簡訊給我因為他想要問我這個句子的…
9545	179	5	63	en-US	So she wrote the message to you because you asked her to help you with a project?
9546	179	5	64	zh-TW	就像我太太先前所說的，我正在進修碩士。在那個學程之中，我要修三十學分才能取的學位。很自然地，我就要寫作業。
9547	179	5	65	en-US	Could you make it clear that what is your master degree about?
9548	179	5	66	zh-TW	是英語教學。在這個課程中，大部分的課程都跟英語教學有關，然後其中一部分是跟語言及文化的能力。
9549	179	5	67	en-US	So you’re seeking a master degree on English teaching, and there’s some courses about cultures and languages. Is that right?
9550	179	5	68	zh-TW	對，至少有三門課跟文化還有語言相關。
9551	179	5	69	en-US	And this kind of cultural courses, what’s the assignment like?
9552	179	5	70	zh-TW	文化及溝通課程的作業每個人都不一樣。以我自己為例，我目前人在台灣，然後正在攻讀英語教學的碩士學位。為了要達成這個目標而且證明我的能力，我必須要證明我有中文的能力。所以很多我的作業是翻成中文的句子。
9553	179	5	71	en-US	You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan. So the exercise in the courses ask you to show… that’s the reason why you need to finish some homework. And the homework is mainly about Chinese and English translation.
9554	179	5	72	zh-TW	對，我要磨練自己的口說還有寫作技巧。
9555	179	5	73	en-US	So let’s go back to the message. This is your homework, right?
9556	179	5	74	zh-TW	對，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這個句子的時候，我不知道怎麼用英文表達。因為有些中文字對外國來講，很難去辨認。我需要幫助，所以我就請我同事幫我。我請他幫我翻譯這個句子，然後用訊息傳給我。
9557	179	5	75	en-US	You mean that because you had an assignment, and you turned to her for help, so she sent the message for you. Is that right? In other words, the message is the answer of the homework, right?
9558	179	5	76	zh-TW	對，那只是作業的答案。
9559	179	5	77	en-US	Then we’re going to see on page 14 to page 16. All the messages. Please verify the content. Are they all the answers of your homework?
9560	179	5	78	zh-TW	對，他們都是我的作業，全部都只有一個目的，就是為了完成我的作業。
9561	179	5	79	en-US	For the point of your wife saying you have an affair with your colleague 彩燕王. What’s your explanation?
9562	179	5	80	zh-TW	她想太多了，我知道他對我支持家庭並不滿意。我想讓庭上了解的是，在我碩士課程的剛開始，他就沒有提供任何協助。她不想要幫我完成學位。如果他願意幫一點點忙的話，我就不用請我同事幫忙。關於這一切的誤解，他要負最大的責任。
9563	179	5	81	en-US	According to your statement, the relationship between both of you doesn’t seem good.
9564	179	5	82	zh-TW	剛結婚的時候，我們的確有段開心的日子。但我的就業造成了一些問題。我想要在台灣交葡萄牙文，但是授課時數並不穩定。所以我的工作便造就了一切問題。我們常為這件事吵架。他不相信我已經盡了全力，我也不知道怎麼讓他了解我的挫折還有困難。
9565	179	5	83	en-US	So let’s go back to the master degree program. When did the program start?
9566	179	5	84	zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始的。是兩年的課程。我在2012的十二月應該要結束。因為我那時候有兼職的工作，沒有足夠的時間完成作業，所以沒有準時畢業。如我先前所說的，我太太不願意幫忙。我覺得我是獨自一人追求那個學位。我很累也很挫折。
9567	179	5	85	en-US	You mean it is a two-year degree, and you didn’t finish it in time. Why is that?
9568	179	5	86	zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成課堂作業。
9569	179	5	87	en-US	So when was the last semester you registered?
9570	179	5	88	zh-TW	是在2012年的秋天。
9571	179	5	89	en-US	If what you have said is true, the last day of your semester should be on December 15th, 2012. So after the program, you won’t have any assignment. Is that right? But the intimate messages continued even six months later after your program. 
9572	179	5	90	zh-TW	就算我沒有作業了，我也想要精進我的中文。雖然我沒有辦法取得那個學位了，我還是想要持續進修，成為獨立學習中文的人。
9573	179	5	91	en-US	You mean that even if you don’t have the courses, you still want to improve your Chinese, right?
9574	179	5	92	zh-TW	對，這就是為甚麼我請我同事幫忙。
9575	179	5	93	en-US	So she is like a tutor for you? 
9576	179	5	94	zh-TW	他不只是像一個家教，他也像一個真正的朋友
9577	179	5	95	en-US	Did you pay her?
9578	179	5	96	zh-TW	我想要付錢，可是他拒絕了
9579	179	5	97	en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why does she want to send the messages at midnight when most people are asleep. Isn’t it beyond what a co-worker would do?
9580	179	5	98	zh-TW	所以我說他非常支持我啊。他用他自己的時間幫我學中文
9581	179	5	99	en-US	Did you still work in the same cram school?
9582	179	5	100	zh-TW	對
9583	179	5	101	en-US	So your colleague 彩燕王also work there now?
9584	179	5	102	zh-TW	他還是在那邊上班，可是我們不是夥伴了。
9585	179	5	103	en-US	Prosecutor, is there anything that you want the court to investigate? Or any person to subpoena?
9586	179	5	104	en-US	I would like to subpoena his colleague 彩燕王 who is working at 伯元 cram school as a witness. I would like to ask her to explain the messages and her relationship between the defendant.
9587	179	5	105	en-US	Plaintiff, is there anything that you want the court to investigate?
9588	179	5	106	en-US	I heard that the cram school has taken some action for the affair of them. And I also heard that they persuaded the woman 彩燕王 to resign. Is there the possibility to ask the cram school to explain about that?
9589	179	5	107	en-US	Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate? The thing is the program ended on December 15, 2012. You can’t just explain your relationship with 彩燕王 through the purpose of finishing the homework. Especially your messages were usually sent during 9 to 12 PM. That is really doubtful. Do you have any evident that may help you in the case.
9590	179	5	108	zh-TW	我想不到法庭能替我調查的事情。如我所說的，我和我同事的通訊，理由都很簡單。我只想要精進我的中文。
9591	179	5	109	en-US	The next court date would be on 4:30 PM, June, 9th, 2014 for the inquiry procedure. Please make sure that you will be here. If necessary, you can have a lawyer with you.

9626	187	5	39	en-US	For these years, did your husband just teach Portugese?
9627	187	5	40	en-US	When we just meet each other, he was teaching Portugese. After we got married, he was still teaching Portugese. However, the Portugese class is not very common in Taiwan, so his teaching hours is not very stable. Sometimes, a period between the class will be 1~2 month. For fixed income, he started want to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he wanted to get an advanced degree. 
9628	187	5	41	en-US	The advanced degree that you just mentioned means that he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?
9629	187	5	42	en-US	No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he tried to get a degree of teaching English. He found a learning program on the internet from California. This program makes him can have on-line learning, and he didn’t need to go to Unite States for these classes. After the classes, he can get the degree.

9633	187	5	46	en-US	In the beginning, I just know that my husband would stay in the school for more hours. I asked him so many times: why he should stay in the school for more hours. It’s just a cram school. He told me that he has a partner, and he has to communicate with his partner for long time. In the beginning, I didn’t think too much. After that, I found he would get some calls in home. And he would avoid get the phone call around me, and he would get the phone call in study room. It made me very suspicious, and I started to check his cell phone. 
9634	187	5	47	en-US	Did you find any evidence in his cell phone?
9635	187	5	48	en-US	I used to see the same number in his cell phone. I am so suspicious, so I started to check his message. After that, I found that he almost sent the message to same woman every day.
9636	187	5	49	en-US	What’s inappropriate thing in the message?
9637	187	5	50	en-US	If that’s a common message, it’s alright. But he got married, how can he have intimate message with others? I just provided some message to the court, and it supposed to be in the file.

9641	187	5	54	zh-TW	恩，那是由我同事傳給我的簡訊。我記得那時候我有兩天的休假，他非常擔心我，這就是為什麼他傳這個簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國接受教育，她非常開放。那就是她說話的方式。關於簡訊裡面的字眼，那只是我們稱呼對方的一種方式。
9642	187	5	55	en-US	So, you mean that because she stayed in the foreign country, her thinking way is westernized. And the way she showed the feeling is open-minded. So, there is no further explanation for “my love,” is that right?
9643	187	5	56	zh-TW	並沒有甚麼其他的意思，那只是好朋友之間的一種稱呼，就僅只於這樣而已。
9644	187	5	57	en-US	How about the sentence before that?
9645	187	5	58	zh-TW	就如同我之前所說，她很擔心我，而且我們只是同事當我連續休了兩天假後，她只是很擔心我。
9646	187	5	59	en-US	So, you mean that because you had two days off, she was worried about you and sent that message for you? Because she didn’t have your assistance, she missed you. That’s all?
9647	187	5	60	zh-TW	沒錯，就是這樣。簡訊的內容並不是甚麼大問題。
9648	187	5	61	en-US	The second message was from the same person. It was sent at 11:55 PM, in January 13 2013. 訊息內容是〝我好希望你在我身邊，我們甚麼時候才能有正當的關係呢?〞What that sentence means?
9649	187	5	62	zh-TW	她發這樣的簡訊給我只是想要讓我知道，這樣的句子如何用另外一個語言來表達。
9650	187	5	63	en-US	So you mean that the purpose of message just want to help you to do the assignment, what’s that mean? 
9651	187	5	64	zh-TW	就像我之前所說的，我有一個遠距教學的課程。在那個課程中我需要修習三十個學分才能完成那個課程。當然在課程中，我必須要完成一些作業。
9652	187	5	65	en-US	Can you just explain about your degree?
9653	187	5	66	zh-TW	我修習的課程是英語教學。課程主要的內容是英語教學、文化以及語言能力。
9654	187	5	67	en-US	So, the degree that you got is TESOL, and there are some culture classes in that degree, is that right?
9655	187	5	68	zh-TW	沒錯，我記得大概有三個課程是有關於文化和溝通的部分。
9656	187	5	69	en-US	What’s the assignment about these classes? 
9657	187	5	70	zh-TW	在課程中，指派的作業對於每個人來說都不太一樣。舉我的例子來說，我是一個在台灣想要教英文的人。為了這個目的我必須在課程中展現我有能力表達好中文。因此，我的作業中有很多是關於中文翻譯的部分。
9658	187	5	71	en-US	So, you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to have the competence of … For that purpose, you had to complete the assignment about translation, is that right?
9659	187	5	72	zh-TW	沒錯，我必須增進我的說和寫能力。
9660	187	5	73	en-US	So, we just go back to that sentence. You mean that the sentence is just for your assignment, is that right?
9661	187	5	74	zh-TW	沒錯我記得那個句子。當我看到那個中文句子後，我並不知道那句子的中文意思是甚麼意思，你知道的阿!有些中文句子對於外國人來說是非常困難的，我需要一些幫助，所以我請我同事幫忙，我請我的同事幫忙翻譯並以簡訊方式寄給我。
9662	187	5	75	en-US	So, you mean that you just asked her to translate. And she just translated it and sent it to you, is that right? This message is just the answer for the assignment, is that right? 
9663	187	5	76	zh-TW	那封簡訊只是作業的答案而已。
9664	187	5	77	en-US	Now, we are going to show you the investigatory file one page14~16. Please see the content of these pages. So, the main purpose of these messages just for the assignment, so she sent that messages for you, is that right, is that right?

9666	187	5	79	en-US	What’s your explanation of adultery between your colleague and you filed by your wife?
9667	187	5	80	zh-TW	我的太太對於這件事情非常感冒，我知道她對於這件事情危害家庭有很大的不悅。我想要告訴庭上的是，她其實對於我的這個並沒有甚麼太大的幫助，他並不希望我得到學位，要是如果她有一點意願幫助我，我也不用去請我的同事幫忙，我覺得她應該因為這件事情遭到譴責。
9668	187	5	81	en-US	According to what you said, both of you didn’t get along with each other …
9669	187	5	82	zh-TW	在我們剛結婚不久時，我們過得很開心。但問題就出在我的工作，我只是想要在台灣教葡萄牙文。但我的授課時數真的很少，所以我的工作成為我們相處之間的問題，我們為了這件事情一直爭吵，他不相信我已經盡了最大努力，我不知道要怎麼跟她說我的挫折。
9670	187	5	83	en-US	We just go back to the degree that you mentioned. When did you start you your program? Did you get the degree?
9671	187	5	84	zh-TW	我在102的春季課程開始的，那是一個為期兩年的課程。我必須在103年的12月完成課程。我並沒有完成我的課程，因為我有一個兼職工作，所以我時間不夠去做那些作業。就如同我之前所說，我的老婆並不支持我，我覺得我一直在靠我自己的能力去追求那些課程，我開始感到很疲倦而且挫折。
9672	187	5	85	en-US	So, you mean that the program is for two years. And you didn’t finish that program, what’s the reason?
9673	187	5	86	zh-TW	我不能完成課程中的所有作業。

9677	187	5	90	zh-TW	恩，我沒有完成那個課程並不代表我想要停止精進我的語言能力。即使我沒有完成那個課程，我還是想要精進我的中文能力
9678	187	5	91	en-US	So, you meant that even if you failed to get that degree, you want to make your Chinese more fluent by yourself, is that right?
9679	187	5	92	zh-TW	沒錯，那就是我為什麼要請我同事幫忙的原因。
9680	187	5	93	en-US	You mean that your colleague is just a role of tutor, is that right?
9681	187	5	94	zh-TW	她並不只是一個家教而已，她也是我的好朋友。
9682	187	5	95	en-US	Did you pay for her? 
9683	187	5	96	zh-TW	沒有，我曾經試圖給她錢，但是她拒絕了。
9684	187	5	97	en-US	If you didn’t pay to her, why would she send that message for you even if in the mid-night. Is that beyond co-worker relationship?
9685	187	5	98	zh-TW	就像我之前所說，她只是一個熱心助人的朋友。她運用很多時間來幫助我學習中文。
9686	187	5	99	en-US	Are you still in that cram school?
9687	187	5	100	zh-TW	沒錯，我還在那裡教書。

9692	187	5	105	en-US	Does the defendant want the court to find some evidences for you? 
9693	187	5	106	en-US	I just heard that the cram school took some steps for them. And they tried to persuade his colleague to leave the cram school. Can we check this? 
9694	187	5	107	en-US	Defendant, do you want the court to find some evidences for you? The situation is that you finished the program on December 5 2012. You should not have the excuses of doing homework for sending the message. Particularly, both of you sent the message for each other after 9:00 PM, it’s very doubted. Do you have any evidence for your case?
9695	187	5	108	zh-TW	我無法想到有甚麼證據可以幫助我的案子，就如同我之前所說，我和我同事之間的簡訊只是平凡的簡訊而已。我只是想精進我的中文能力而已。

In addition, the defendant will always make up reasons for going out in the with Wang Cai Yan and also has the tele-conference with her in the midnight. According to the information found by the plaintiff, she found that their relationship is beyond co-worker’s relationship. Therefore, she filed for this case.

9725	195	5	33	en-US	 I understand.
9726	195	5	34	zh-TW	我明白

9728	195	5	36	en-US	We have already married for four years, and we do not have kid.
9729	195	5	37	en-US	Do you marry your husband in Taiwan or in other country?
9730	195	5	38	en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan as a Portuguese teacher.
9731	195	5	39	en-US	During those years, did he teach Portuguese?
9732	195	5	40	en-US	When we met, he was a Portuguese teacher, and after we married, he still taught Portuguese. But Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan; therefore his teaching hours are not stable. Sometimes he might did not have any class between one or two months. Because he wanted to make our financial status more stable, therefore he started to taught English. But his mother tongue is not English; therefore, he sought an advanced degree.
9733	195	5	41	en-US	You mention before that he sought an advanced degree, do you mean he studies a degree in Taiwan?
9734	195	5	42	en-US	No. Because he hoped to teach English in Taiwan, therefore, he have to get the degree of the TESOL. On the Internet, he found a distance learning program provided by California school. He did not have to go to the US, and can learn on-line. After he finishes the classes, he can get the degree. His plan is to find an English teacher job in Taiwan by getting an US degree.
9735	195	5	43	en-US	Can you explain the relationship between your husband and the woman in this case?
9736	195	5	44	en-US	They are co-workers in cram school. In the cram school, they have the system of a foreigner teacher partner with a Chinese teacher, and they are partners.
9737	195	5	45	en-US	How did you know they are having an affair?
9738	195	5	46	en-US	At first, I found that my husband started to stay at the cram school for a long time. I asked him many times “It is just a cram school, why did you have to stay there so long?” He told me that because he had to partner with a Chinese teacher, and they had to cooperate with each other. At first, I did not suspect he is having an affair with her. But after a while, I noticed that, my husband would get some phone calls after he came home. When he received those phone calls, he did not speak the phone directly in front of me, instead going to the study room. That is the reason why I checked the information in his cell phone.
9739	195	5	47	en-US	Did you find anything strange in his cell phone?
9740	195	5	48	en-US	 I saw his phone calls always from one number, so I was curious about the text messages and I checked them. After I checked the messages, I found that he almost chatted with a woman everyday.
9741	195	5	49	en-US	I think it is okay to text messages, is anything wrong in the content?
9742	195	5	50	en-US	If those messages’ content are normal, that will be okay. But he is a married man, how could he let a girl to text him some intimate messages? I have provided some content of the messages, I think they might in the investigation file.

9744	195	5	52	zh-TW	對，這些是我電話中的簡訊。
9745	195	5	53	en-US	Now I have some question about the message content. The first message is from the cell phone 0958-932xxx at 9:50 p.m., on December thirty first, 2012. The content is 我非常想你 可以請你解釋一下嗎?
9746	195	5	54	zh-TW	這是我同事發來的。我記得那陣子，我休了兩天的假。她可能有點擔心吧。這就是她發給我這封簡訊的原因。我同事在美國受過教育，他非常開放，這是她的講話方式啊!至於她稱呼我是她的愛人，這只是她的一個稱呼罷了。
9747	195	5	55	en-US	You mean that because the people was educated in the USA, and she is westernized, and she is open minded to express her feeling, so the name, my love, does not mean a lot?
9748	195	5	56	zh-TW	這只是普通朋友間很常見的稱呼，或者是表達你對你很親密朋友的關心罷了
9749	195	5	57	en-US	How about the previous line?
9750	195	5	58	zh-TW	我說啦，她很擔心我，我們是夥伴啊!當我請了兩天的假以後，她當然會開始想我阿。
9751	195	5	59	en-US	You are saying that because of your two days off, she texted you this kind of message. Without your help in the work, she missed you a lot. Is that all?
9752	195	5	60	zh-TW	這封簡訊就沒甚麼大不了的，內容是很普遍的， 這只是很單純的簡訊。
9753	195	5	61	en-US	The next message was from the same cell phone at 11:55 p.m., on January thirteenth, in 2013.內容是我想要你在我身逼，甚麼時候才能在一起呢? Can you explain the content?
9754	195	5	62	zh-TW	她發簡訊給我，只是為了告訴我功課的中文該如何表達的一句話
9755	195	5	63	en-US	Do you mean that she sent this message to you just to help you with your homework can you explain that?
9756	195	5	64	zh-TW	我太太之前有跟庭上報告過，我正在上遠距離教學。為了得到學位，我必須完成30學分，當然啦，我就必需完成一些功課或者是作業。
9757	195	5	65	en-US	Can you explain that what is your master degree for?
9758	195	5	66	zh-TW	我的碩士學位是有關英語教學的。這個學位的課程內容有些是有關英語語言能力的、有些是有關文化跟英語教學。
9759	195	5	67	en-US	So you are saying that in your master degree, the main program is for English competence, but there are some culture classes?
9760	195	5	68	zh-TW	對，我記得課程裡有3門課程是有關文化溝通的。
9761	195	5	69	en-US	Can you tell me the homework of the culture communication classes?
9762	195	5	70	zh-TW	這門課裡，每個學生的作業都是因人而異的。以我自己為例的話，我在台灣想要當一名英文老師，為了達到這個目的，我需要證明我有足夠的語言能力，尤其是對中文的掌握。所以我的功課內容很多是有關中英語間的翻譯。
9763	195	5	71	en-US	Your plan is to teach in Taiwan. Therefore, you have to prove you have the Chinese competence. So you have to finish some assignments, and that is about translation between Chinese and English, is that right?
9764	195	5	72	zh-TW	我還必須加強我的寫作和口語能力。
9765	195	5	73	en-US	Okay, let’s go back to the next point. You said that is your homework, is that right?
9766	195	5	74	zh-TW	我記得這句話。當我拿到這句話的中文時，我不知道要怎麼把它翻成英文。你知道的，中文對外國人來說是很難辨識的，它們都長得一樣。我需要一些幫助，所以我就請我的同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯這句話，再把這句話寄給我。
9767	195	5	75	en-US	You are saying that you gave your college the Chinese sentence, and she translated it into English and sent it back to you. Is that right? In other words, the content of this message is just a part of your assignment, is that right?
9768	195	5	76	zh-TW	這封簡訊的內容，就只是我作業的答案。
9769	195	5	77	en-US	Now, please check page 14 to 15 of file one, the content of all messages. Please check those messages. Are they all your assignments, and you ask your co-workers to help you?
9770	195	5	78	zh-TW	這些簡訊都只有一個目的，就是為了幫助我完成我的作業。
9771	195	5	79	en-US	So, as for the accuse from you wife that you are having affair with Cai Yan Wang, what is your explanation?
9772	195	5	80	zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了。我知道她覺得我對家庭的付出不夠。我想要強調，再我求學的這段過程，我太太一開始完成沒有支持我。她不希望幫助我完成我的學業，如果她願意幫助我的話，我根本就不需要請我的同事幫我。我覺得她應該為造成這種誤解負責。
9773	195	5	81	en-US	According to what you said, I think there might be some misunderstanding between you and your wife.
9774	195	5	82	zh-TW	我們剛結婚時真的很甜蜜。但我的工作造成我們之間的問題，我試著在台灣教葡萄牙，但我的授課時數一直很不穩定，所以我的工作問題就造成我們兩個之間的不和，我們為了我的工作常常吵架。她不相信我已經近全力在工作了，我也不知道我要怎麼表達我己經…我的沮喪、我的難過
9775	195	5	83	en-US	Okay, let’s back to your master degree. When did you start your master degree? Did you finish? ….When was it?
9776	195	5	84	zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始課程的。這是一個兩年的課程。我本來應該在2012年的12月拿到學位。可是我並沒有拿到學位，因為我必須在台灣做兼職工作，而我沒有很多時間來做我的作業。像我之前說的，我太太並不支持我。我覺得我在追求學位的時候是一個很孤單的過程，我覺得太疲累、太沮喪。
9777	195	5	85	en-US	Did you mean the program is a two-year program but you did not finish the course? Why?
9778	195	5	86	zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成課程的要求。
9779	195	5	87	en-US	When was your last semester registration? 
9780	195	5	88	zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋天。
9781	195	5	89	en-US	If you are telling the truth, the last day of your registration was December fifth, 2012. So after the day, basically you do no have any homework, is that right? Can you explain why you kept contacting with your co-worker after the last day of your registration for six months?
9782	195	5	90	zh-TW	恩..我沒有拿到學位，但不代表我不想增進我的中文能力。雖然我沒有拿到學位，我也想要練習我的中文，所以我一直自學。
9783	195	5	91	en-US	You mean that even though you fail to finish the degree, but you still want to improve your Chinese and make you speak Chinese fluently?
9784	195	5	92	zh-TW	對，所以我才請我的同事幫忙。
9785	195	5	93	en-US	So, the role of your co-worker is as your tutor?
9786	195	5	94	zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，還是我一個貼心的朋友。
9787	195	5	95	en-US	Did you pay her?
9788	195	5	96	zh-TW	沒有，我有試著付她錢但是她拒絕了
9789	195	5	97	en-US	So, if you did not pay her, why did she need to text you in the midnight when everyone is sleeping? Does that far beyond co-worker’s relationship?
9790	195	5	98	zh-TW	所以我才說他是一個很支持我的朋友。她用她自己私人的時間來幫助我學習中文。
9791	195	5	99	en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?
9792	195	5	100	zh-TW	對，我還在那家補習班工作
9793	195	5	101	en-US	And, does the co-worker, Cai Yan Wang, still work there?
9794	195	5	102	zh-TW	她也還在那家補習班工作，但我們現在已經不是夥伴的關係了。
9795	195	5	103	en-US	Prosecutor, is there any evidence you need to investigate or any witness to subpoena?
9796	195	5	104	en-US	I would like to subpoena Cai Yan Wang, who is still working at the Bo Yuan cram school, as a witness. We want her to explain the reason why she texted those messages, and explain the relationship between she and the defendant.
9797	195	5	105	en-US	Plaintiff, is there any evidence you want the court to investing for you?
9798	195	5	106	en-US	 I heard that the cram school has do some action because of their relationship. And there even someone was trying to persuade Cai Yan Wang to leave the cram school. Is it possible to verify the truth?
9799	195	5	107	en-US	Defendant, is there any evidence you want to court to investigate for you? The situation is your program was ended on December fifteenth, 2012. There is still no reason for you to keep texting messages with Cai Yan Wang for helping the homework. Especially, most of your messages are after nine o’clock, it is very suspicious. Do you have any evidence to prove your innocence?
9800	195	5	108	zh-TW	我現在想不到有任何證據可以提供給法院來證明我的行為。我說過了，我和我同事間的簡訊互動是非常平常。我只是想要繼續學中文，並且增進我的中文能力。
9801	195	5	109	en-US	So the next court will be at four o’clock p.m., on July ninth, 2014. The main purpose of the court is to examine the witness’s statements. Plaintiff and defendant please show up on that day. If necessary both of you can have your lawyers. Do you understand?

9852	203	5	55	en-US	As you said, the one who sent the message was educated in America, so she is very open mined or westernized. So the way she express herself is more open minded. So the term “My Love” do not mean anything, right?

9947	211	5	45	en-US	So how did you know about this affair?
9948	211	5	46	en-US	 At first, I just noticed that my husband always stay in the cram school to do over-work, I think. I had asked him so many times: it’s just a cram school, how did you have so many works to do? He told me that because this partner teaching, he has to discuss with his partner a lot.

9956	211	5	54	zh-TW	這是一個我的同事傳給我的。我記得那個時候我請了兩天假。她有點擔心。這就是為什麼他要傳這封簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，她的思想非常開放。那就是她講話和表達感情的方式。那至於”我的愛”，我們就是這麼稱呼所在意的人。
9957	211	5	55	en-US	You mean this message sender… because she was… was in the United State, so she’s more westernized? So he…so her way to show her express… to express his emotions is more… open? So, “my love” didn’t mean anything, is that right?
9958	211	5	56	zh-TW	當然沒有啊。這就只是兩個感情很好的朋友，或者是很關心彼此的朋友之間的表達方式阿。
9959	211	5	57	en-US	So the former sentence she said?
9960	211	5	58	zh-TW	就像我說的，她很擔心我，我們是工作上的夥伴。我請假兩天，她當然會想我啊。
9961	211	5	59	en-US	You mean, she sent these messages just because you took two days off? Without your help in the class, she missed you a lot, is that so?
9962	211	5	60	zh-TW	對，最主要就是那個概念，簡訊內容並不重要。
9963	211	5	61	en-US	The second message, is sent in 2012, Jan. 13th, and is in evening 11:15…11:55, and is from the same person. (後面又翻成中文了orz) Can you tell me what these means? Why would she say something like this?
9964	211	5	62	zh-TW	她寫這封簡訊給我，主要是為了表示…主要是為了表達……怎麼用中文的方式表達。
9965	211	5	63	en-US	You mean that she sent you these messages to help you on your assignment?
9966	211	5	64	zh-TW	就像我太太曾經跟庭上所講過，我正在學習一個美國學位…一個碩士學位。在這個學程裡面，我被要求要完成三十個
9967	211	5	65	en-US	Can you just explain what exactly you’re study for you master program? For you master degree?
9968	211	5	66	zh-TW	我的學位是英語教學。在這個學位裡面，主要是教有關英語教學，但是也會參雜著有關英語能力的學習，以及文化。
9969	211	5	67	en-US	So you mean you’re getting a TESOL degree, but that can include some English competence, is that right? ……some course about the culture, not English competence.
9970	211	5	68	zh-TW	對，我記得至少有三門課是有關於文化和溝通。
9971	211	5	69	en-US	In these culture and communication courses, what assignments did you have?
9972	211	5	70	zh-TW	對每個學生來說，文化與溝通功課可能…對每個學生來說，都不一樣啊。就以我自己來舉例，我是一個在台灣試圖教…取得英語教學證明的外國人。為了證明我的能力，我必須證明我的中文能力。所以我有很多中英互翻譯的作業。
9973	211	5	71	en-US	You mean because you wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so this degree ask you to prove your ability to use… Chinese? So you have to finished the assignment, and this assignment included sentence translation, is that right?
9974	211	5	72	zh-TW	對。而且我還被要求要加強我的口說和寫作能力。
9975	211	5	73	en-US	So back to the former sentence… the former line, you said this is your assignment, is that right?
9976	211	5	74	zh-TW	對，我記得這個句子。當我拿到這個中文句子的時候，我不知道怎麼把他翻成英文。你知道，有些中國字對外國人來說是很難認的。我需要一些幫助，所以我請我同事幫忙。我請她幫我翻譯這個句子，然後傳簡訊給我…傳答案給我
9977	211	5	75	en-US	You mean because you asked her how the sentence was said in…you send her the sentence in Chinese, and she translated it into English for you, and send you the answer, is that right? So this message is an answer for your assignment?
9978	211	5	76	zh-TW	對，那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
9979	211	5	77	en-US	And now please see the p.14 to 16 in the record. Please see the content. Are these all because you ask for help to your assignment, so the other person sent these to you?
9980	211	5	78	zh-TW	對，這些簡訊全都是為了我的作業。
9981	211	5	79	en-US	So back to the point that you wife said you have an affair with your co-worker, Tsai-yian Wang, what’s your saying?
9982	211	5	80	zh-TW	我太太真的事對這件事想太多了。我知道她對於支撐這個家的能力並不是非常滿意。但我希望法院…我希望庭上知道，在我的學習過程中，她從來沒有支持過我。她根本就不願意幫我完成我的學位。如果她能多支持我一點的話，我就不用向我同事求助了。我覺得她才是這整起誤會需要被…最需要…最主要負責的人。

9992	211	5	90	zh-TW	我沒有完成那個課程，並不代表我不想增進我的中文能力…我的語言能力呀。雖然我沒有完成指定課程，但我還是想增進我的中文能力，所以我決定自修。

9998	211	5	96	zh-TW	沒有。我曾經提供過這個想法，但她拒絕了。
9999	211	5	97	en-US	So, if you didn’t pay her, then why would she still send these message at the hour, at this late hour that she supposed to be rest, to be sleeped, to you? Is that beyond the co-worker obligation?
10000	211	5	98	zh-TW	就像我說的阿，她是一個非常真誠、非常支持的朋友。她利用她自己的私人時間來幫助我學習中文。
10001	211	5	99	en-US	Do you still teaching English at that cram school?

And this is something normal people won’t… wouldn’t do. Do you have any evidence can help this case.
10010	211	5	108	zh-TW	我覺得庭上沒有甚麼可以為我調查的證據了。就像我說的，我和我同事之間的關係非常簡單，只想增進我的語文能力，學習中文。

10036	219	5	29	zh-TW	我了解了
10037	219	5	30	en-US	Today we are her for the preparation procedure for adultery. The plaintiff sued up for the case. It is because her husband John Anderston is in a relation with a teacher from his colleague. The plaintiff found some intimate messages from her husband’s phone. Plus, her husband, the defendant, usually have some excuses to stay in the cram school with his colleague王彩燕, and sometimes has some tele-conferencing. What the plaintiff has collected of the information are actually beyond the colleagues’ relationship. As a result, the plaintiff sued up. Defendant, your wife thinks you have affairs with you colleague. What’s your plead?
10038	219	5	31	en-US	當然沒有阿
10039	219	5	32	en-US	In today’ preparatory procedure, we are here for asking the messages between the defendant and his colleague. The purpose is to understand the defendant and his colleague really have intimate messages and even adultery. Do both parties of you fully understand your rights?
10040	219	5	33	en-US	I understand
10041	219	5	34	zh-TW	我明白
10042	219	5	35	en-US	Plaintiff, how long do you marry your husband. Do you have children?
10043	219	5	36	en-US	We have married for 4 years, and we have no kids.
10044	219	5	37	en-US	Did you marry you husband in Taiwan or foreign countries?
10045	219	5	38	en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
10046	219	5	39	en-US	In the past a few years, did he only work for teaching Portuguese?
10047	219	5	40	en-US	When we first met, he is a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued his teaching. However, in Taiwan, Portuguese is not a famous English language, which is like English, so his teaching hours is not stable. Sometimes he will have even a period between jobs about two months. Afterwards, in order to make stable income, he started to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English. As a result, he seeks an advanced degree.
10048	219	5	41	en-US	You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean he want to study a program in Taiwan?
10049	219	5	42	en-US	No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he has to have a degree of English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California on the internet. So he don’t have to go to school but can have an on-line learning at home. After he finished all he course, he can got the master degree. His plan is that if he got the master degree in Taiwan, then he can also teach English. So what is the relationship between him and the person he has affair with?
10050	219	5	43	en-US	They are colleagues of cram school.
10051	219	5	44	en-US	The cram school plans a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher working together for a program, and the woman is his partner. 
10052	219	5	45	en-US	How do you know they have some affairs?
10053	219	5	46	en-US	At first, I just noticed that my husband usually stayed at cram school for over work. I have asked him for many times. It is just a cram school. How could he work so much? He told me because he needs to partner with the Chinese teacher, so they need a lot of time to communicate and discuss. At first, I really didn’t think too much. But later I found he usually got some phone calls after he was home. And he usually picked up his phone in the study room rather with me. It seems like he wants to hide something, so I check his phone book.
10054	219	5	47	en-US	Do you find anything weird in his phone?
10055	219	5	48	en-US	In his phone records, I found there is a number showing up for many times, Because I am curious about that, I check his test messages, too. After I checked his text messages, I found they text each other almost every day.
10056	219	5	49	en-US	Just texting, it is not that serious. Is the content not appropriate?
10057	219	5	50	en-US	If that is just a common message, it’s okay. But he has got married, how could he text the kind of messages with other woman? I have provided some messages to the court. I think they are in the files.
10058	219	5	51	en-US	Please show the evidence record, number 13. Here are some text messages. Defendant, please check it. Are these from your phone’s text messages?
10059	219	5	52	zh-TW	是的，這是我手機裡面的簡訊內容
10060	219	5	53	en-US	Now I have a few questions about these messages. The first message is from 0958-932-XXX at 9:50 PM on December 31th, 2012, is that right? The content shows “I really miss you, my love.” What did it mean?
10061	219	5	54	zh-TW	那只是我同事傳給我的訊息，我記得那時候我請了兩天假，她只是太擔心了而已，這大概就是她為什麼會傳這樣的簡訊給我的原因，我同事是在美國受教育的，所以她比較開放一點，這就是她平常的說話方式跟表達方式，至於所提到的「我的愛」，只是我們平常用來稱呼我們比較親密在乎的人而已
10062	219	5	55	en-US	You mean the sender is that westernized because she stayed in United State for many years and the way she expresses herself is quietly open as well. So “my love”, this word means nothing. Is that right?
10063	219	5	56	zh-TW	對阿，這在好朋友之間是很常見的，而且我們又是這麼熟的朋友
10064	219	5	57	en-US	What about the sentence she just mentioned?
10065	219	5	58	zh-TW	就如同我所說的，她只是擔心我，因為我們是工作上的同事阿，所以我沒去上班幾天，她想我也是滿正常的
10066	219	5	59	en-US	You mean that she sent this message to you just because you are not for work for two days. Because without your assistance, so she missed you a lot. That’s all?
10067	219	5	60	zh-TW	對阿就是這樣，簡訊內容根本沒有什麼問題啊
10068	219	5	61	en-US	The second message is from the same number at23:55 PM on January 13th in 2013. The content of the message is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this message mean?
10069	219	5	62	zh-TW	她傳這封簡訊的目的只是要問我在中文裡面要怎麼表達這個句子的意思
10070	219	5	63	en-US	You mean she sent this message to you just to help you finish your homework? What does that mean?
10071	219	5	64	zh-TW	在我太太提告之前，我正準備要完成我的碩士學位，在這課程當中，我必須修滿30個學分才能結業，所以很自然地我當然必須完成一些練習還有作業阿
10072	219	5	65	en-US	Can you explain what’s your master degree about?
10073	219	5	66	zh-TW	我學的是英語教學，在這課程當中，大部分跟英語教學有關，但有些也跟文化還有語言能力有關
10074	219	5	67	en-US	So what you got your master degree is a TESOL, and there are also some culture programs, right?
10075	219	5	68	zh-TW	是阿，我記得當中至少有三門課程是跟文化有關係的
10076	219	5	69	en-US	So this kind of culture program… what kind of homework will it has?
10077	219	5	70	zh-TW	關於文化與溝通這方面，可能會因為不同學生而因人而異，拿我自己為例子，我是打算在台灣尋求英語教學資格，為了證明跟表達我自己能力，我必須展現出我對中文的掌握能力，因此在我的作業當中有很多中英互相翻譯的作業
10078	219	5	71	en-US	You mean you want to teach English in Taiwan so that the program ask you to prove the language competence of Chinese, is that right? So you have to finish some homework, and the homework is about sentence translating. Is that right?
10079	219	5	72	zh-TW	對阿就是這樣，而且我也同時被要求要精進我自己的聽跟口說能力
10080	219	5	73	en-US	OK that’s go back to what we just mentioned. You mean that this is your homework right?
10081	219	5	74	zh-TW	對阿，我還記得那個句子，當我拿到這個中文句子時，我實在不知道怎麼去翻譯，你知道有些中文的字對外國人來說是非常難去理解的，我需要一些協助所以我就請我的同事幫忙，我請她幫我翻譯並把句子傳給我
10082	219	5	75	en-US	You meant that you ask your colleague to tell you what’s the meaning, and she translates into English form and send it to you? In other words, the message is just the content of your homework?
10083	219	5	76	zh-TW	對，這封訊息真的只是我作業的答案
10084	219	5	77	en-US	That’s take the documentary, the file from page 14 to page 16. Here are some contents of the messages. Please check these messages. Are these all out of your homework so you seek for your colleague’s help and she sent them back to you?
10085	219	5	78	zh-TW	對，所有的簡訊內容都只是幫助完成我的作業
10086	219	5	79	en-US	So what’s your explain about your wife charged you and your colleague王彩燕have an affair?
10087	219	5	80	zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了，我知道她覺得我能力不足以養整個家，我希望庭上了解，在我開始修課之後的所有期間，她從未提供我任何協助，她根本沒有想要幫助我完成學位的意思，如果她願意幫助我的話，我根本不需要向我的同事求助，我覺得她應該為這些所有誤會道歉
10088	219	5	81	en-US	According to your words, it seems like you and your wife have some misunderstanding and even unhappy?
10089	219	5	82	zh-TW	在我們剛結婚時，一開始我們確實過得很開心，但問題出在我的工作，我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但沒有辦法有穩定的教學時數，所以我的工作變成我們之間的問題、導火線，我們為這件事情吵了很多次，她不肯相信我已經盡全力了，我也沒有辦法讓她了解我所面臨的困境和無力
10090	219	5	83	en-US	Ok let’s go back to your master degree you just mentioned. When did you start your master degree? Did it end already? 
10091	219	5	84	zh-TW	我是在2010年的春季開始上課的，我必須要在12月22日完成這個課程，我並沒有完成我的學業，因為我同時在打工，而且沒有時間做我的作業，
10092	219	5	85	en-US	You mean the term of this program is two years long, but you didn’t finish it. Is that right?
10093	219	5	86	zh-TW	我沒有辦法修完所有的課程
10094	219	5	87	en-US	So when did you finish the course?
10095	219	5	88	zh-TW	我最後一次註冊的時間點是2012年的秋季
10096	219	5	89	en-US	As you just mentioned, you course ended on December 5th in 2012, which means you won’t have any homework afterwards. Is that right? But you and your colleague still have some inappropriate messages after you finish your course for six months. What does that mean?
10097	219	5	90	zh-TW	即使我沒有繼續修課了不代表我沒有繼續增進我語言能力的意思，為了增進我的中文能力，我只能夠靠自己繼續練習下去
10098	219	5	91	en-US	You mean even you didn’t finish the program you still want to sharpen your Chinese skills?
10099	219	5	92	zh-TW	對，這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫忙
10100	219	5	93	en-US	So your colleague is just like your tutor, tight?
10101	219	5	94	zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，她也是我的真心朋友
10102	219	5	95	en-US	Did you pay her?
10103	219	5	96	zh-TW	沒有，我曾經想過但是被她拒絕了
10104	219	5	97	en-US	If you didn’t pay her anything, why did she send these messages to you so late? Was that too much for a colleague doing this for you?
10105	219	5	98	zh-TW	這也是為什麼我說她是一個…很挺我的朋友阿，她用她自己的個人時間來幫助我學習中文
10106	219	5	99	en-US	Are you still teaching in that cram school?
10107	219	5	100	zh-TW	是的，我還在那裡上班
10108	219	5	101	en-US	What about your colleague, 彩燕王? Is she still working there?
10109	219	5	102	zh-TW	她還在那邊工作，但我們已經沒有再一起搭檔了
10110	219	5	103	en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any further questions or any evidence that you want to ask?
10111	219	5	104	en-US	I want to subpoena on 彩雲王, who works for the cram school, and come here to get some information. I would like to understand the background of these text messages between the defendant and his colleague.
10112	219	5	105	en-US	Do you want the court to help you investigate?
10113	219	5	106	en-US	I heard that the cram school had some actions against their affairs. And even the cram school officers tried to ask 彩燕王 to leave the job. Can the court check this from the cram school?
10114	219	5	107	en-US	Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you? Your work has already ended at December 5th 2012, you have no excuses to text messages with 彩燕王 for finishing assignments. Especially your text interactions are at night after 9 o’clock. That’s weird. Do you have any evidence that can help you with the case?
10115	219	5	108	zh-TW	我想不到任何庭上可以代替我去調查的證據，就如同我所說，我同事跟我之間的傳訊內容就真的這麼單純而已，我只是希望她能過增進我的中文能力，然後幫助我繼續學習中文下去
10116	219	5	109	en-US	So the next court date will at 4:30 PM on June 9th in 2014 for the inquiry procedure of the witness. The plaintiff and the defendant, both of you need to show up. If necessary, both of you can have a lawyer.

10149	227	5	37	en-US	Did you and your husband get married in Taiwan or abroad?
10150	227	5	38	en-US	My husband and I met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and taught Portuguese.
10151	227	5	39	en-US	So in the past few years, is his job teaching Portuguese?
10152	227	5	40	en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued teaching Portuguese. However, in Taiwan Portuguese is not that popular, so his teaching hours was not…teaching hours were not that stable. Sometimes he has periods between jobs for like…one or two months. After that, in order to get more stable income, he decided to start teaching English. However, his mother tongue is not English…he decided to seek an advanced degree.
10153	227	5	41	en-US	You said that he was going to seek for an advanced degree, do you mean that he’s going to study a degree in Taiwan?
10154	227	5	42	en-US	No. Because he hoped that he could teach English, he had to get a degree of teaching…English teaching. He found a distance learning program on the internet which is provided by California. In this case, he didn’t have to go to the United States. He only had to do online learning. After he got all the credits, he can get…master degree. His plan is that after he got this English teaching degree, he can teach English in Taiwan.
10155	227	5	43	en-US	So what is his relationship with this person he has an affair with?
10156	227	5	44	en-US	They are colleagues…in cram school…in the cram school he works for. The plan of the cram school is that foreign teacher partner with Chinese teacher, and that woman is his partner.
10157	227	5	45	en-US	How did you know that they committed…he committed adultery?
10158	227	5	46	en-US	In the beginning, I just found that he stayed at school to work extra hours. I asked him several times: it’s just an English cram school, what is the need of working extra hours? He told me that because he had to partner with the Chinese teacher, he had to spend much time to communicate…spend much time communicating. In the beginning, I didn’t doubt him at all. However, I found that he often had some phone calls after work. When he got the phone call, he would never talk in my presence, he would go to the study room. This…I doubt because of this, so I checked his cell phone.
10159	227	5	47	en-US	What did you see in his cell phone then? Something unusual…anything unusual?
10160	227	5	48	en-US	I often see the same number in his calling record, so I was quite curious and looked at his messages…checked his messages. After I checked his cell phones, I found that he messaged with this…with a woman every day.
10161	227	5	49	en-US	What is big about sending messages? Is the content not appropriate?
10162	227	5	50	en-US	 If it’s something very usual, I won’t really care, but he’s a married man, how can he let the other one send messages which is a bit…vague? In the past, I have already provided some contents of the messages. They should be in the documents.
10163	227	5	51	en-US	Please look at page 13 of the document. Here are some contents…here of the contents of the messages. Defendant, please take a look. Is these…are these the messages in your cell phone?
10164	227	5	52	zh-TW	是的，是我簡訊的內容。
10165	227	5	53	en-US	So now I’m going to focus on the content of the messages…I’ll ask you some questions. The message is send by the phone number 0958-932*** in November 31st, 2012 at 9:50 PM. The content is “我非常想念你,”What does this mean?
10166	227	5	54	zh-TW	就是我同事傳的啊。我記得那個時候我請了兩天假，她有點擔心。那就是為什…所以她才傳這樣的簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，所以很開明…開放，那就是她講話的方式。就是…「my love」這樣的詞就只是我們叫我們關心的人的方式。
10167	227	5	55	en-US	You mean that this woman stayed abroad, so her thoughts are more westernized? And the way her…she expressed her feelings is more…open-minded? So the phrase “my love” doesn’t really mean anything, right?
10168	227	5	56	zh-TW	對啊，那是好朋友之間，或是很關心彼此的朋友表達的方式…稱呼彼此的方式。
10169	227	5	57	en-US	How about the previous sentence?
10170	227	5	58	zh-TW	我就說了，她…她很關心我，我們是工作上的好夥伴。當我請假兩天，他很自然地就會想念我啊
10171	227	5	59	en-US	 You mean that the woman sent you this message just because you took two days off? Because you didn’t…you weren’t there to help her in class, she missed you? Is that right?
10172	227	5	60	zh-TW	對啊，內容就是這樣子，根本沒什麼大不了的。
10173	227	5	61	en-US	So let’s look at the second message which is sent at 11:55 PM, January 13th, 2013 by the same person. 內容是我想要你在我身邊，我們什麼時候可以在一起？What does this mean? Why do you have that sentence in your cell phone?
10174	227	5	62	zh-TW	她寫那句話是想告訴我一句中文該怎麼說。
10175	227	5	63	en-US	You mean that she sent you this message because she was helping you finishing your homework. What does this mean?
10176	227	5	64	zh-TW	就像我妻子提到的，我現在正在修碩士課程。在那個學位中，我要修完三十個學分才能拿到學位。那我當然就要…完成一些練習、作業。
10177	227	5	65	en-US	Can you please explain which program you are studying?
10178	227	5	66	zh-TW	我的碩士課程是英語教學。這個課程主要就是英語教學，然後還會有一些文化語言…文化方面的東西還有語言能力等等。
10179	227	5	67	en-US	So you’re studying for the TESOL program, so there are some cultural lessons in that program, is that true? Is that right?
10180	227	5	68	zh-TW	對，我記得至少有三門課是跟文化與溝通有關的。
10181	227	5	69	en-US	So what kind of assignments do you have from these cultural communication course?
10182	227	5	70	zh-TW	對每個學生來說，這堂課的作業都不太一樣。我以我自己來說的話，我是在台灣然後想要成為一位英文老師。為了要拿到這個學位、表示我有能力，我也要證明說我的中文是很好的。所以很多我作業的內容都是中英翻譯的句子。
10183	227	5	71	en-US	Do you mean that you plan to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove that you have sufficient Chinese competence, is that right? So you have to finish some assignments in class, and these assignments are about translating sentences…between Chinese and English, right?
10184	227	5	72	zh-TW	對啊，我也被要求就是要增進我的口語表達和寫作能力。
10185	227	5	73	en-US	Let’s go back to the previous sentence. You said that they’re your assignments, right?
10186	227	5	74	zh-TW	對啊，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這些…就是中文的句子的時候，我不知道英文怎麼講。你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說實在是太難了。我需要一些幫忙，所以請我的同事幫我。我請她翻譯一下那個句子，然後傳簡訊給我。
10187	227	5	75	en-US	So you said that you didn’t know the meaning of that sentence, so you ask your colleague to send you the translation in English by message, is that right? So the content of the message is the answer of your assignment, right?
10188	227	5	76	zh-TW	對，那個就是我作業的答案。
10189	227	5	77	en-US	So how about…let’s look at the content of the messages on page 14 to 16 on the document. Please check the content. Is these messages sent by your colleague because you need help doing your assignment?
10190	227	5	78	zh-TW	是的，所有的內容都是我要做作業所以傳的。
10191	227	5	79	en-US	So what do you want to say to your wife saying that you committed adultery with your colleague, Tsai-Yan Wang.
10192	227	5	80	zh-TW	我覺得她真的想太多了，關於這件事情。我知道她對我…對我照顧家庭的狀況不滿意。我想要讓法院知道的是，從我說我想要修這個學位開始，她就沒有提供任何的支持。她根本就不想要幫助我完成學位。如果她沒有這麼…如果她支持我的話，我就不會去尋求我同事的幫助。我覺得會產生這些誤會都是她的問題。
10193	227	5	81	en-US	According to your words, the relationship between you two is a bit unpleasant, is that right?
10194	227	5	82	zh-TW	剛開始結婚的時候，確實相處得還不錯。但是問題就是…但是問題就是我的工作。我試著要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是授課時數就是不夠。然後我們兩個的關係就是因為我的工作變得不太好。我們為了這件事情…常常為了這件事情爭吵。她不相信我已經盡我所能了。我沒有辦法讓他了解我的…有多沮喪然後遇到的困難是什麼。
10195	227	5	83	en-US	OK, let’s go back to the master degree you were talking about. When did you start studying for your master degree. When did it end? Did you get the degree already?…Have you got the degree already?
10196	227	5	84	zh-TW	我本來是在2010年的春天開始的…一開始。那是兩年的課程。我本來是應該是在2012年的12月完成這個學位。我之所以沒有準時拿到是因為我要工作…然後沒有辦法有時間去寫我的作業。就像我剛剛說的，我的老婆一直都沒有很支持我。我覺得我根本就是一個人在追求這個學位，我覺得很累很沮喪。
10197	227	5	85	en-US	You said that this was a two-year program, and you didn’t finish it. Why is that?
10198	227	5	86	zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成所有的課程…修完所有的課程。
10199	227	5	87	en-US	When did the semester you last registered ended?
10200	227	5	88	zh-TW	恩…是在2012月四月。
10201	227	5	89	en-US	So…as you said, according to your saying, the course ended on December 5th, 2012. After that…you won’t have…you didn’t really have assignments, right? But the messages between you and colleague continued until…continued for another six months. Why is that?
10202	227	5	90	zh-TW	我或許沒有想要把那個課程修完，但不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。就算我沒有修完那個學位，我還是想要增進我的中文能力，所以我開始自學。
10203	227	5	91	en-US	You mean that even though you haven’t finished your English, you still want to let your Chinese become more fluent, is that right?
10204	227	5	92	zh-TW	對，所以為什麼我請我同事幫忙。
10205	227	5	93	en-US	So this colleague is somehow like…a tutor of yours, right?
10206	227	5	94	zh-TW	她不是只是一個家教而已，而且還是一個真正的好朋友。
10207	227	5	95	en-US	Did you pay her?
10208	227	5	96	zh-TW	沒有，我曾經要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
10209	227	5	97	en-US	 If you didn’t pay her, why does she send messages in the middle of the night with such effort? Is that beyond colleague…relationships between colleagues?
10210	227	5	98	zh-TW	所以我說這個朋友很支持我啊。她用她自己的時間幫助我學中文。
10211	227	5	99	en-US	Do you still teach English at that cram school?
10212	227	5	100	zh-TW	對，我還在那裡工作。
10213	227	5	101	en-US	Is this woman, Tsai-Yan Wang your colleague, still working there?
10214	227	5	102	zh-TW	對啊，她還在那裡工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。
10215	227	5	103	en-US	Prosecutor, do you want to investigate any further evidence?
10216	227	5	104	en-US	I hope to subpoena Wang…Tsai-Yan Wang, the colleague of the defendant, who works at Bo-Yuan Cram School. I hope that she can explain her relationship with the defendant and in what situation…under what circumstances are these messages sent.
10217	227	5	105	en-US	Defendant, do you…what other evidences do you want us to investigate?
10218	227	5	106	en-US	I heard that the cram school has taken some action concerning the relationship between them. And the cram school even asked the woman, Tsai-Yan Wang, to leave her job. Is it possible for…to check with the cram school about this matter?
10219	227	5	107	en-US	Now, defendant, do you want to ask the court to investigate any evidence for you? The situation is…you have already completed…the courses have already been completed on December 5th, 2012. There…it is not acceptable that doing assignment is an excuse for Tsai-Yan Wang sending messages to you. Especially the time you send messages is always after 9 PM, that is quite doubtful. Do you have evidence which can help you with your case?
10220	227	5	108	zh-TW	我想不到任何法庭可以為我調查的證據。就像我說的，我們傳簡訊的原因非常簡單，我只是想要增進我的語言能力，然後繼續學中文。
10221	227	5	109	en-US	So…the next court will be set at 4:30 PM, June 9th, 2014. We will inquire the witnesses. Plaintiff, defendant, both of you please come to the court. If it is necessary, you can both have lawyers, is that OK?
10222	227	5	110	en-US	I understand.

10351	243	5	29	zh-TW	我瞭解。
10352	243	5	30	en-US	Today this is the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. This case was filed by the plaintiff, Yu-hua Chen. The main reason for doing so is because the plaintiff’s husband is beyond a workers’ relationship.The plaintiff has discovered intimate messages in the defendants’ text mailbox. In addition, the defendant would make excuses … often make excuses to stay after work and frequently teleconference with his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang.…The information the plaintiff collected proves that the relationship is beyond a working relationship between colleagues.Therefore, she filed the case. The defendant, your wife accuses you of adultery. What’s your plea?
10353	243	5	31	zh-TW	我當然是無罪啦。
10354	243	5	32	en-US	In our preparatory procedure today, our main goal is to inquire the details of the messaging between the defendant and your colleague. Our objective today is to make sure that the defendant really is committing adultery with a colleague. Are the two parties aware of the procedure?
10355	243	5	33	en-US	I understand.
10356	243	5	34	zh-TW	我明白。
10357	243	5	35	en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you been married to your husband. Do you have any children?
10358	243	5	36	en-US	We have been married for four years. We don’t have any children.
10359	243	5	37	en-US	Were you married in Taiwan or abroad?
10360	243	5	38	en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. 4 years ago he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese
10361	243	5	39	en-US	In the recent years, he… has been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan?
10362	243	5	40	en-US	When we just met, he was a Portuguese Teacher. After we were married, he continued to teach Portuguese. Portuguese is not a language popular among Taiwanese so his teaching hours were… unstable.Sometimes he would have empty…hours up to two months.Afterwards, to obtain a more stable income, he began to teach English. But English was not his mother tongue so he decided to seek advanced education.
10363	243	5	41	en-US	By advanced education, do you mean he sought a degree in Taiwan?
10364	243	5	42	en-US	No. Since he wished to teach English in Taiwan, the degree he sought must be related to English Education. He found a long distance online course from California of the United States… online. So he didn’t need to go to America in person to take the class. So when he obtains all his credits, he also gets his masters degree. His plan was to find an English teacher position in Taiwan through getting a degree from the United States. 
10365	243	5	43	en-US	What is the relationship he has with the person he has an affair with?
10366	243	5	44	en-US	They are collegues at the cram school. The cram school has a policy to partner up mandarin teachers and foreign teachers. That woman is the mandarin teacher partnered up with him.
10367	243	5	45	en-US	How did you know they were in an affair
10368	243	5	46	en-US	At first I only found that my husband often stayed long after work hours. I asked many times: It was only an English cram school, why would he need to stay so often after work? He told me that since he had to partner up with a Mandarin teacher, there had to be much effort put in to communicating with each other. At first I didn’t suspect anything at all. Later on, I found that after he would come home, he would receive phone calls. When he picks up the phone, he would never talk on the phone in person, but go to his study room instead. Because of this, I began to suspect him, so I inspected his phone record.
10369	243	5	47	en-US	…Did you find anything unusual in his cellphone?
10370	243	5	48	en-US	In his call records, there was… one number that frequently appeared. So I was… curious and began to inspect his text messages, too. And then I realized he was texting a woman almost everyday.
10371	243	5	49	en-US	Is it really that serious?
10372	243	5	50	en-US	If it’s a normal, an usual text then there wouldn’t be any problem. But he is a married man, how could he let another person send intimate messages to him like that? Previously, I’ve sent some copies of their text messages of theirs to the court, they should be in the evidence right now.
10373	243	5	51	en-US	Evidence number one, please. Page 13. There are a few message contents in here. May the defendant please take a look at them? Are these the text messages that are in your cell phone?
10374	243	5	52	zh-TW	對，這是我手機裡的簡訊。
10375	243	5	53	en-US	Then I have some questions to ask you about these messages. The first text message was sent from the phone number 0958-932XXX at 9:50 PM of November 21st 2012. The content is: “I really miss you, my love.” What does this mean?
10376	243	5	54	zh-TW	呃，這是我同事寄給我的。我記得我當時有兩天沒去上班。她有點擔心我。所以才傳這封簡訊給我。我的同事去美國留過學，所以非常開放，這是她講話的方式。至於她稱呼我為「my love」,這只是他對在乎的人表達的意思。
10377	243	5	55	en-US	So you mean the person who sent this message was educated in America, she’s more westernized. She’s more open with expressing her affections. So, by calling you my love there isn’t any meaning?
10378	243	5	56	zh-TW	不，這是好朋友之間很常有的用語，只是表達對彼此的在乎。
10379	243	5	57	en-US	What about the previous message before this… name?
10380	243	5	58	zh-TW	就像我先前提到的，她只是為我擔心而已，我們是同事的關係。我有兩天沒去上班，她自而然地…為我擔心。
10381	243	5	59	en-US	What you mean is the only reason for her doing so is you took two days off from work? And because you were not there to help her in class, she missed you? Is that it?
10382	243	5	60	zh-TW	對啊，那就是整件事情的脈絡。沒什麼大不了的。
10383	243	5	61	en-US	All right. The second text message was also sent from the same cell phone number from 11:55pm of January 13th 2013. Inside the text message, it says, “I want to be by your side, when can we be truly together?” What does this mean? Why would a message like this appear in your cellphone?
10384	243	5	62	zh-TW	她傳這個訊息給我是想要告訴我我作業裡的回答要怎麼講。
10385	243	5	63	en-US	You mean she sent you this text message to help you with your homework? What do you mean by that?
10386	243	5	64	zh-TW	就像我妻子在法庭中提到的，我當時在修一堂課。那堂課需要修滿30個學分我才能取得學位，所以我當然需要完成一些作業和練習。
10387	243	5	65	en-US	Can you please elaborate on what you really are learning for your masters?
10388	243	5	66	zh-TW	我修的是英語教育的課程。期中，有些課程是漢英語教學相關。有的是漢西方文化或語言能力有關。
10389	243	5	67	en-US	So your seeking a TESOL masters degree, some courses are related to culture?
10390	243	5	68	zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三堂課與文化和傳播有關係。
10391	243	5	69	en-US	Then, what kind of an assignment would you have to finish for the courses in culture and communication?
10392	243	5	70	zh-TW	每個學生會收到的作業可能都不同。舉我自己的例子來說吧，我人在台灣，然後想要找一份英語教學的工作。為了達成這個目標，然後展現我的能力，我必須表現出我對中文的瞭解。所以我的作業很多都是和中英翻譯有關係。
10393	243	5	71	en-US	What you mean is that because you are seeking a job to teach English in Taiwan, the homework requires you to have Chinese competence as well? So you have to finish certain assignments in your course, and they are often related to Chinese-English translation.
10394	243	5	72	zh-TW	是的，當然我還被要求要有口說還有寫作能力。
10395	243	5	73	en-US	OK, let’s go back to what we mentioned before, you said this was your assignment, right?
10396	243	5	74	zh-TW	對，我記得那句話。當我拿到中文句子時，我不知道英文剛怎麼說。你知道的，有很多中文的句子對外國人來說很難理解。我需要一些幫助，所以我同事來幫我。我請她幫我翻譯那個句子，再把答案寄給我。
10397	243	5	75	en-US	So the situation was… you gave the Chinese sentence to your colleague and she sent back the English translation of it? So this text message was only an answer for an assignment?
10398	243	5	76	zh-TW	那封簡訊就只是作業的答案而已。
10399	243	5	77	en-US	OK, then, let’s take a look at Evidence number 1, page 14 to 16. Please take a look at the content. Are the reason behind sending all these text messages, your homework assignment?
10400	243	5	78	zh-TW	是的，所有的簡訊都是要幫助我回答我作業的問題。
10401	243	5	79	en-US	Then may I ask you, may you explain that your wife is accusing you of having an affair with your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang?
10402	243	5	80	zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了。我知道她對我很不滿意，就在于沒辦法照顧好家庭上。法官我希望你知道，從我開始攻讀碩士到現在她一直沒有支持我。她一點也不想幫助我完成學業。她要是更支持我一點，我才不需要請我同事來幫我。我想這所有的誤解應該怪在她身上才對。
10403	243	5	81	en-US	According to your statement, there seems to be an unhappy relationship between the two parties.
10404	243	5	82	zh-TW	在我們剛結婚的時候，我們的確度過了一些美好的時光。但是我的失業就是一個很大的問題。我嘗試要找到教葡萄牙文的工作，但沒辦法取得很穩定的工作時數，所有工作問題就成為我們兩個人之間的阻礙。我們時常為了這件事情吵架。她不認為我已經盡力了。我也真的沒辦法認清我的狀況與我面臨的問題。
10405	243	5	83	en-US	Ok, then, let’s return to the Masters degree you mentioned. When did your courses begin? Did you finish all your courses? Did you obtain your degree?
10406	243	5	84	zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始上課。它是一個兩年的課程。我本來能在2012年十二月完成學位的。但我最後沒有取得學位，因為當時有堅持的工作然後不夠時間去完成作業。就像我先前提到的，我老婆並不太支持我。我覺得我是孤單一個人地在爭取這個學位。我開始感到累，然後煩惱。
10407	243	5	85	en-US	So you mean this…degree requires two years, two terms. But you didn’t finish your degree, why?
10408	243	5	86	zh-TW	我沒辦法去達到所有的課程的要求。
10409	243	5	87	en-US	And when did your last term that you were registered in school end?
10410	243	5	88	zh-TW	我註冊的最後一學期是2012年的秋天。
10411	243	5	89	en-US	If what you say is true, then your final term ends at September 12th 2012. And by then all your homework assignments have ended. But you continued to sent text message after the end of your course for over 6 months, how do you explain this?
10412	243	5	90	zh-TW	我雖然沒有拿到學位、沒有完成這些課程，但這並不代表我不想繼續讓我英文進步啊！雖然我沒有完成我的課程，但我想不斷讓我的語言能力進步，所以我繼續努力。
10413	243	5	91	en-US	So what you mean is that although you didn’t finish your masters courses, you wanted to improve your Mandarin on your own, is that right?
10414	243	5	92	zh-TW	對，這就是為什麼我找我同事幫我。
10415	243	5	93	en-US	Then the role your colleague takes is kind of like your tutor, is that right?
10416	243	5	94	zh-TW	她不單只是我的家教，也是我真心的好朋友。
10417	243	5	95	en-US	Did you pay her?
10418	243	5	96	zh-TW	沒有，我有主動提出要給她錢，但她拒絕我了。
10419	243	5	97	en-US	If you didn’t pay her, then why did she reply your text messages late at night when she supposedly should be asleep? Doesn’t this exceed what colleagues do to help each other?
10420	243	5	98	zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個很支持人的朋友。她犧牲她自己的時間來幫我學中文。
10421	243	5	99	en-US	Are you still teaching English at that cram school?
10422	243	5	100	zh-TW	是，我還在那邊工作。
10423	243	5	101	en-US	Is your coworker Tsai-Yen Wang still working there?
10424	243	5	102	zh-TW	她也正在那邊工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。
10425	243	5	103	en-US	Prosecutor, are there any witnesses you wish to subpoena or evidences you wish to show?
10426	243	5	104	en-US	I wish to subpoena the defendant’s coworker Tsai-Yen wang from the cram school. I would like her to explain the relationship she has between her and the defendant, and her reason for sending the text messages.
10427	243	5	105	en-US	Plaintiff, are there any evidence that you wish for the court to investigate?
10428	243	5	106	en-US	I heard the cram school has taken some actions in response to the relationship between those two people. Somebody has tried to ask Tsai-Yen Wang to leave her position. I wonder if the cram school can… if there are any evidence to show this fact?
10429	243	5	107	en-US	Now, the defendant, are there any evidence you wish for the court to help you investigate? The current situation is your degree courses have ended on December 5th 2012. Homework assignments is no excuse for the texting between you and Tsai-Yen Wang. Especially when your text messages are mainly sent after 9 PM at night. This arises suspicion. Do you have any evidence that may help you with your case?
10430	243	5	108	zh-TW	我想不到任何證據可以請法院幫我調查的。就像我之前提到的，我和我同事往來的原因其實很簡單：我只想讓我的中文進步，然後不斷地練習中文而已。
10431	243	5	109	en-US	The next…witness… the next court for the case will be on June 9th 2014, 4:30PM. The plaintiff and the defendant are required to come to court in person. If it is necessary, you can all appoint lawyers, do you understand?

Moreover, the defendant would make up some reasons, umm..for example, to have extra working hours in order to teleconference with his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang.

10466	251	5	39	en-US	Then for the past few years, has his work always been teaching Portuguese? 
10467	251	5	40	en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, and after we got married, he was still teaching Portuguese. However, among Taiwanese, Portuguese is not a very prevalent and famous language. Therefore, his teaching hours are not too many. Sometimes, he even had a period between a month or two between jobs. Afterwards, in order to have a more stable income, he decided to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English; therefore, he decided to learn English and seek an advanced degree.
10468	251	5	41	en-US	What you mean by “seeking an advanced degree” is that he planned to pursue a higher degree in Taiwan? 
10469	251	5	42	en-US	 No. He hopes to teach English in Taiwan; therefore, he needs to receive a degree which is related to English TESOL, and he found a distance learning program which is launched in California. Through this distance learning program, he’s able to learn online without flying to America. Therefore, after receiving the credits, he will be able to receive a master’s degree. His plan was that through getting this master’s degree, he will be able to teach English in Taiwan. 
10470	251	5	43	en-US	Then I would like to ask what is the true relationship between his and the person who he had an affair with? 
10471	251	5	44	en-US	Well, they are colleagues at the cram school. At the cram school, the woman was partnered with my husband, and the woman was a Chinese teacher, and my husband an English teacher.
10472	251	5	45	en-US	Then how can you proof that they did have an affair?
10473	251	5	46	en-US	Well, at the beginning, I just noticed my husband often worked for longer hours at the cram school. And I asked him many times about how come? It was just a cram school! There’s no need, no way to have longer working hours. He told me that he needed to discuss about teaching matters and communicate with his Chinese partner. Therefore, at the beginning, I didn’t doubt him at all. But afterwards, I’ve found out that he will often receive calls after work. The strange this was, when he was answering these calls, he would just go back to his study room and answer the calls instead of answering them in front of me. Therefore, this made me very skeptical of him, and I checked his mobile phone.
10474	251	5	47	en-US	Then did you find anything wrong or anything strange?
10475	251	5	48	en-US	Well, I’ve found out that one number appeared very, very often in his cell phone record. Therefore, I was so curious that I checked his instant messages. Then, I found out that he sent messages with a woman nearly every day.
10476	251	5	49	en-US	It’s just merely messages. How about the content? Are they unusual or intimate?
10477	251	5	50	en-US	If they were just normal messages, then I’m okay with that. However, he is married to me, how can he allow that woman to send him such intimate messages? I provided some content of the messages to the court earlier. I believe they’re in the folder. 
10478	251	5	51	en-US	Let’s look at evidence one, page thirteen. Defendant, please take a look at some of the messages here. Were these messages the same with the messages in your cell phone? 
10479	251	5	52	zh-TW	是的。一模一樣。
10480	251	5	53	en-US	 Then I would ask you some questions according to these messages. The first message appears to be sent by someone, whose number was 0958932, at 9 pm, November 31, 2012, and the content was, I really miss you, my love.” What does this mean? 
10481	251	5	54	zh-TW	喔，那是我同事發給我的啊。我記得我那時候請假，請了兩天。她那時很擔心我吧。那就是為甚麼她會發那一封訊息給我。而且她是在美國長大、受教育的，所以她是一個非常開放的女生。那就是她講話的方式和表達的方式啊。至於「我的愛」，只是互相叫對方會用的辭啊，並沒有代表甚麼意思。
10482	251	5	55	en-US	Okay, so do you mean that the person who sent this message to you was westernized because she was educated in the US? Therefore, she was very open with her feelings, and the word “my love” doesn’t mean anything, is that right? 
10483	251	5	56	zh-TW	對啊，當然沒有意思啊， 因為那只是親密的朋友或好朋友之間的稱呼而以。
10484	251	5	57	en-US	Then how about the previous sentence that she sent? 
10485	251	5	58	zh-TW	我剛剛已經提到了，她那時候非常擔心我，而且我們是工作夥伴! 我兩天沒去工做啊，她當然會想我啊!
10486	251	5	59	en-US	Okay, what you mean is, because you haven’t been to work for two days; therefore you colleague missed you and was worried about you? Moreover, without your assistance, she missed you? Was that merely the reason? 
10487	251	5	60	zh-TW	對啊，內容就是這樣子，所以我的那一封訊息根本不算甚麼啊!
10488	251	5	61	en-US	Okay, let’s look at the second message, sent by the same person at 11:55 pm, January 13, 2013. The content was, “I want you by my side, when will we be together?” So what did this sentence mean? Why did this person want to send you this sort of content?
10489	251	5	62	zh-TW	因為她要教我如何用中文表達這一種內容。
10490	251	5	63	en-US	Oh, so you mean she sent you this message in order to teach you, assist you, explain to you how to translate sentences? What does this mean? 
10491	251	5	64	zh-TW	就像我太太跟庭上說的，我正在攻讀碩士學位。要順利拿到學位，我必須拿到30學分。當然是要做一些作業、一些練習啊。
10492	251	5	65	en-US	Please explain clearly to me, what were you studying for concerning your master’s program? 
10493	251	5	66	zh-TW	就是英語教學的碩士學位啊。在學位裡面，還有分英語教學的課程、文化的課程、和交流的課程。
10494	251	5	67	en-US	So you mean that this master’s degree was mainly about English teaching; however, you are also studying about culture interaction, right?
10495	251	5	68	zh-TW	對，至少有三門課是跟文化交流、溝通相關的。
10496	251	5	69	en-US	So what sort of assignment will be assigned in these courses? 
10497	251	5	70	zh-TW	每個人所被分配到的作業不一樣。因為我现在在台灣，希望找到一份英語教學的工作。因此，為了達成這個目標，我必須能證明我有足夠的中文能力。因此我有很多作業都是有關中英字句的翻譯。
10498	251	5	71	en-US	So you mean that because you planned to teach English in Taiwan; therefore, this master’s degree will be able to proof that you have enough Chinese language competence? Therefore, you have the finish the assignments being assigned in these courses, and the assignments include Chinese and English sentence translation? 
10499	251	5	72	zh-TW	對沒錯，而且我有必須加強我口說和寫作能力。
10500	251	5	73	en-US	Okay, then let’s start again. You said that this was your assignment, right?
10501	251	5	74	zh-TW	對，我記得。當我拿到那一份作業的時候，我不知道它是甚麼意思。而且你知道，對有些外國人來說，有些中文字句非常難懂。因此，我非常需要幫助，所以我就問了我的同事啊。我請她幫我翻那一句話，然後透過簡訊傳給我答案。
10502	251	5	75	en-US	Okay, so what you mean was that at that time, you first sent the Chinese version of that sentence, and she helped you translate it and sent you that sentence in English? Is that right? And that means this message was just the answer to your assignment? 
10503	251	5	76	zh-TW	沒錯，只是作業的答案。
10504	251	5	77	en-US	 Okay, then let’s take a look at evidence one, page 14 to 16, and let’s take a look at all the content of all the messages. Please, just take a look at these contents. And the main reason was, because you want to finish your assignment, and you asked your colleague to translate them for you? 
10505	251	5	78	zh-TW	沒錯，所有的訊息都是因為我要完成我的作業，拿到答案，所以才會有這些訊息。
10506	251	5	79	en-US	Then how about your wife filing the adultery case against you and your colleague Ms. Tsai-Yen Wang? 
10507	251	5	80	zh-TW	我太太對於這事真的想太多了。我知道她對於我提供家庭一些資金啊不是很滿意。在此，我想告訴庭上，我在攻讀碩士學位期間，我太太從來沒有關心我。而且她也沒有協助我完成我的碩士學位。如果她願意支持我、幫助我的話，那我也不會請我的同事幫我啊。所以我覺得她才是要被責怪的對象。
10508	251	5	81	en-US	According to your saying, it seems that between you and your wife, the relationship is not very good. 
10509	251	5	82	zh-TW	結婚後的一段時間，我們相處確實很好啦。但是最大的問題在於我有沒有工作。我在台灣試著教葡萄牙語，但是我的時數很少。因此這個問題就成了我們兩人之間的一到牆。我們為這件事就一直吵架，吵了好多次。她不認為我已經盡力了。她也不了解我面臨這種窘境的時候，感到多受挫、多憤怒。
10510	251	5	83	en-US	Okay, then let’s go back to the master’s degree that we’ve just mentioned. When did you start that master’s program? Did you receive a master’s degree? Has it ended?
10511	251	5	84	zh-TW	我在春季2011年入學的。我需要攻讀兩年。我應該是要在103年的12月就要完成這個學位。但是因為那時我兼職，導致我無法準時完成我的學位，因為沒時間寫作業。如同我剛剛所提的，我太太一點都沒支持我。結果我那時就覺得非常的無助啊，好像是我自己孤拎拎的要拿到那個學位。因此我感到非常的勞累、受挫。
10512	251	5	85	en-US	Okay, so you said that this master’s degree requires a two-year study; however, you didn’t received that degree on time, why?
10513	251	5	86	zh-TW	因為我無法如期完成課程所需的作業。
10514	251	5	87	en-US	Then when was the last date you registered for the program? 
10515	251	5	88	zh-TW	是在103年的秋季班註冊。
10516	251	5	89	en-US	According to your statement, the semester that you finished the course would be December 5, 2012, and after your complete that semester, you won’t have any assignment, right? However, the colleague kept sending your messages six months after your study, why was that
10517	251	5	90	zh-TW	我那時候是還沒有拿到碩士學位，但是那又並不代表我不想增進我的語言能力。縱使我沒有拿到那個學位，我依然想要我的中文能力進步啊，自己字學啊。
10518	251	5	91	en-US	So you mean that even if you didn’t successfully get that master’s degree, you still hope to improve you Chinese ability, is that so?
10519	251	5	92	zh-TW	對啊，而且那就是為什麼我會尋求我的同事幫助。
10520	251	5	93	en-US	So the role that your colleague was playing equals to your mentor? 
10521	251	5	94	zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，還是我真正的朋友。
10522	251	5	95	en-US	Then, did you pay her? 
10523	251	5	96	zh-TW	沒有喔，沒有付錢給她。我有提過要付給她，但是她拒絕了。
10524	251	5	97	en-US	If you didn’t even pay her, then why would she be willing to send you messages in the middle of the night, when she could just sleep? Don’t you think that this was just beyond coworker’s relationship? 
10525	251	5	98	zh-TW	我才會說她是一個非常好的朋友啊。她願意占用她自己的時間，幫助我。
10526	251	5	99	en-US	Are you still teaching at that same cram school?
10527	251	5	100	zh-TW	是的，我還是在那裏工作。
10528	251	5	101	en-US	So, is your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang still working at that cram school, too?
10529	251	5	102	zh-TW	對，她還在那裏工作，但我們已經不是搭檔了。
10530	251	5	103	en-US	Does the prosecutor need to subpoena or have other witnesses? 
10531	251	5	104	en-US	I hope to subpoena the defendant’s coworker Tsai-Yen Wang who works at Po-Yuan cram school, and come here as witness. I would ask her to clearly state the background and goal of the messages she sent to the defendant.
10532	251	5	105	en-US	Plaintiff, do you wish the court to investigate on any evidence? 
10533	251	5	106	en-US	I’ve heard that the cram school has already taken some action against the relationship between them. About their action, they have persuaded Tsai-Yen Wang to quit her job. I would like to ask whether it is possible to verify this issue. 
10534	251	5	107	en-US	Now, currently, the situation is that you finished your master’s degree on December 5, 2012, Therefore, making an excuse of doing an assignment with Tsai-Yen Wang is not really reasonable. Especially, the interaction between you two often appears after 9 pm. That makes one very, very skeptical. Do you have any evidence which may help you with your case? Now, let me ask the defendant, what would you like the court to investigate on the case?
10535	251	5	108	zh-TW	沒有，我並沒有證據要庭上代表我去偵查。之前已經提過了，我和同事之間的交流、互動是非常簡單的。只是想要增進我的語文能力，繼續學中文啊。
10536	251	5	109	en-US	The court will set the time to ask the witness to come to the court at 4:30 pm, June 9, 2012. The plaintiff and the defendant need to come to the court. And if it’s necessary, each party can ask for a lawyer.
10537	251	5	110	en-US	Yes, I understand.
10538	251	5	111	zh-TW	明白。
10539	251	5	112	en-US	The court is adjourned.
10540	259	5	1	en-US	Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure for the case of adultery, case number 2887.

10557	259	5	25	en-US	First, you have the right to remain silent, and you do not have to make any statement against your will.
10558	259	5	26	en-US	Second, you have the right to a lawyer. If you come from If you come from a low-income family, a medium-and-low-income family, or if you are an aborigine or meet other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.

10560	259	5	28	en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?
10561	259	5	29	zh-TW	是，我了解。
10562	259	5	30	en-US	Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The plaintiff, Yu-Hua, Chen, filed this case. The reason for the plaintiff to file this case is that her husband, John Anderston, is beyond co-workers’ relationship with a person. The plaintiff found some intimate messages and records in the defendant’s cell phone. Furthermore, the defendant, John Anderston, found reasons for working late in the cram school and conducted tele-conferencing with Chai-yan Wang. The contents collected by the plaintiff were beyond co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, your wife is wondering whether you have an affair with others, so she accused you.
10563	259	5	31	zh-TW	我當然無罪。
10564	259	5	32	en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the court will focus on the details of these tele-conferencings and intimate messages. The purpose of this procedure is to see whether the interactions between John Anderston and Chai-yan Wang constitute the adultery. Did both parties understand this procedure?
10565	259	5	33	en-US	Yes, I understand.
10566	259	5	34	zh-TW	我也明白。
10567	259	5	35	en-US	Plaintiff. How long have you got married with the defendant? Did you have a child?
10568	259	5	36	en-US	We have been married for four years, and we don’t have any child.
10569	259	5	37	en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or other countries?
10570	259	5	38	en-US	I met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
10571	259	5	39	en-US	So, in the past years, his job in Taiwan is to teach Portuguese.
10572	259	5	40	en-US	When we knew each other initially, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan; his teaching hours were not stable. Sometimes, there had been a period between works for months. In order to have stable incomes, he decided to teach English instead. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek a advanced degree.
10573	259	5	41	en-US	You just mentioned that he wanted to seek a advanced degree. Did he want to get a degree in Taiwan?
10574	259	5	42	en-US	No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan. The degree he wanted to get is about English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California in the United Stated on the Internet. This program allowed him to learn by on-learning, so he didn’t have to go abroad. After he finished all the courses of the program, he could get the degree. He planed to get the degree so that he can teach English in Taiwan.
10575	259	5	43	en-US	So, what is the relationship between the person he have an affair with, Chai-yan Wang?
10576	259	5	44	en-US	They are co-workers in the cram school. The cram school staff arranged one Chinese teacher partnering with a foreign teacher. Chai-yan Wang is the Chinese teacher.
10577	259	5	45	en-US	How did you know they have some extramarital affairs?
10578	259	5	46	en-US	Initially, I noticed that he often stayed late in the cram school for working. I had asked him before because it was just a cram school to teach English. How can he work so late? He told me that because his partnered with a Chinese teacher, they had to discuss more in detail. In the beginning, I did not suspect of him. Later, he often got some phone calls after he came home. After getting the calls, he all went to the study room to talk and did not talk before me. This behavior made me suspect, so I checked his cell phone.
10579	259	5	47	en-US	Is there any doubtful clue in his cell phone?
10580	259	5	48	en-US	In his calling record, there is one number showing up very often. So, I checked his text messages with that number. After I checked text messages, I found that he sends messages with a woman every day.
10581	259	5	49	en-US	Sending text messages is not a big deal. Is that very inappropriate?
10582	259	5	50	en-US	If this is a normal text message, that’s all. But he has got married with me, how can he send intimate messages with another woman? I have provided some details about these messages to the court, and these details may be included in the investigatory files.
10583	259	5	51	en-US	Please check page 13 on the investigatory file 1. These are the contents taken from those messages. Please check it. Were these contents from your messages?
10584	259	5	52	zh-TW	是，這是從我的手機簡訊中取下來的。
10585	259	5	53	en-US	Now, the court will ask you some questions in terms of this content. The first is the message sent at 9:50 on November 31st, 2012, and the number is 0958-932XXX. The content is “我非常想念你.” What does that mean?
10586	259	5	54	zh-TW	這是我一個同事發給我的。我記得那時候我請兩天假。她非常擔心。這才是為什麼她傳簡訊給我。我同事是在美國受教育的，她的思想十分開放。這就是她說話的方式。至於裡面說的愛，只是我們關懷他人的說法而已。
10587	259	5	55	en-US	You said that the woman was educated in the United States, so her concept is more westernized. The expression about her emotion is more open-minded. So, the word “my love” does not have some other implications, does it?
10588	259	5	56	zh-TW	這只是好朋友間會講的，沒有什麼特別的意思。
10589	259	5	57	en-US	How about the last sentence?
10590	259	5	58	zh-TW	如前所說，她非常擔心我，我們是工作同事。我兩天沒到，她當然會掛念我。
10591	259	5	59	en-US	So, you mean that the person sent this message to you because you had two day off at that time? Without your assistance in class, she was very missing you. Is that all?
10592	259	5	60	zh-TW	對，沒錯，這簡訊不是什麼大問題啊。
10593	259	5	61	en-US	The second message was sent at 11:55 p.m. on January 13th, 2013. The message is that “我想要妳陪我，我們什麼時候能在一起呢.” What does this sentence mean? Why is there such a message
10594	259	5	62	zh-TW	她寫這個句子的原因是，要怎麼把這個句子寫成中文，這是我們作業的內容。
10595	259	5	63	en-US	Did you mean that she sent you this message because she wanted to help you complete you assignment? What dose that mean?
10596	259	5	64	zh-TW	就像我太太跟庭上所說，我有英語教學的課程。在那個課堂中，我必須要取得30學分，才能擁有學位。當中我會有些作業和活動。
10597	259	5	65	en-US	Could you explain the degree you were perusing?
10598	259	5	66	zh-TW	我的課程是英語教學。在那課程中，有英語教學課程，也有文化背景的相關教學。
10599	259	5	67	en-US	So you are pursuing the degree from the graduate school of TESOL, and in this program, there are some classes related to culture competence. Is that true?
10600	259	5	68	zh-TW	沒錯，我記的有3個是有關文化溝通的。
10601	259	5	69	en-US	In this class, what were the assignments given within it?
10602	259	5	70	zh-TW	在文化溝通這堂課中，每個學生的作業都不同。拿我自身舉例。我想在台灣找個英語教學的職位。為了這個目標，我必須要有能力來證明我的中文能夠變通。所以在作業上，有許多中英翻譯。
10603	259	5	71	en-US	So, you mean that you wanted to teach in Taiwan. Therefore, in the courses of the program, you have to proof your Chinese competence. So, you have to finish the assignments arranged by the program so that you can prove your language competence. Is that right?
10604	259	5	72	zh-TW	沒錯，我也想增進我的聽力還有寫作能力。
10605	259	5	73	en-US	So, let us go back to the sentence. This sentence is your assignment. Is it true?
10606	259	5	74	zh-TW	對，我記得這個句子。當我拿到一個英文句子時，我不知怎麼用中文講它。有些句子外國人很難說。我需要些幫忙，所以就找我同事。我問他怎麼翻譯這個句子，她就用簡訊回我。
10607	259	5	75	en-US	So you mean that you asked the collogue to translate the sentence into Chinese and that she sent back with the English sentence. Is that true? That is to say, the sentence in the text message is that answer of your assignment. Is that right?
10608	259	5	76	zh-TW	這個句子只是我作業的答案而已。
10609	259	5	77	en-US	Now, please check page 14-16 on the investigatory file 1.Please check the content. Because you asked for help to complete your assignment, she sent these messages. Is that right?

Then he hoped he can get the fixed income, so he started to teach English. However, because his mother language is not English, he decided to seek an advanced degree.
10783	275	5	41	en-US	You mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree, is he want to get a degree in Taiwan?
10784	275	5	42	en-US	No. Because he hoped to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he achieved has to be English teaching. He found a distant learning program which is provided by the California in America on the Internet. He can complete his courses with the distant learning without going to the America. In this way, he can achieve the doctor degree. He planned to achieve American degree to find the English teaching job in Taiwan.

He told that he had to partner with the Chinese teacher, and there are so many things to discuss. In the beginning, I didn’t doubt him. However, I found that he will get some phone calls after work. After he got the phone call, he will not talk in front of me; instead, he will go to the study room. I started to doubt him, so I checked his cell phone.
10789	275	5	47	en-US	So what did you see in his cell phone that is innormal
10790	275	5	48	en-US	In his phone call history, there is a fixed number. So I was curious that I checked his messages. After checking, he has sent a message to a woman almost every day.
10791	275	5	49	en-US	Is there any wrong to send message? Is it because the message is not so appropriate?
10792	275	5	50	en-US	If the message is so ordinary, then it will be fine. But he was a person who got married, how can he send the intimate messages? I provided the message contents to the court. I think they are all in the file.

10796	275	5	54	zh-TW	嗯…那是我同是寄的啊！我記得那時候我請了2天的假。她感到有點擔心。這就是為甚麼她寄給我這種簡訊。我同事在美國讀過書，所以她非常的開放。那就是她說話的方式啊！為甚麼她說”love”這個字呢? 這就是我們稱呼彼此的方法啊！
10797	275	5	55	en-US	You mean that the message sender because he once studied in America so she is open minded? And she is also open minded in emotion expression, so the word “my love” do not have any special meaning?
10798	275	5	56	zh-TW	沒有啊，在朋友之間這是非常平常的表達方法
10799	275	5	57	en-US	How about the sentence she mentioned?
10800	275	5	58	zh-TW	就像我說的啊，她非常擔心我，我們是工作上的夥伴啊！當我請了2天假，她非常想念我啊！
10801	275	5	59	en-US	You mean because you took two days off so the woman sends this message to you? Without your assistance, so she missed you? Is that…?

10807	275	5	65	en-US	Can you explain that what is your major in your master degree?
10808	275	5	66	zh-TW	我的主要課程是英語教學。在那個課程中，有些是有關英語教學的，有些則是有關文化和語言能力。
10809	275	5	67	en-US	So what you learn is English teaching, but there are some cultural courses in this program?
10810	275	5	68	zh-TW	是的，我記得至少三門課是跟文化和溝通有關。
10811	275	5	69	en-US	So what’s the assignment that this course will require?
10812	275	5	70	zh-TW	這文化溝通課程的作業會依每個學生而不一樣。以我自己為例，我來台灣是為了想要找到教學的工作，為了達成這個目標並表達我有足夠的能力，我必須擁有足夠的中文。所以很多作業都是有關中英翻譯。
10813	275	5	71	en-US	You mean you want to teach Chinese in Taiwan, so in this program of master degree you have to prove your have competence of Chinese. And you have to finish assignment in this course, and some of the assignment is about English and Chinese translation?

10815	275	5	73	en-US	Let’s move back to the message we mentioned before. Is that your assignment?
10816	275	5	74	zh-TW	是啊，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這個中文句子，我不知道要怎麼翻譯。你也知道有些中文字對外國人來說非常難。我需要一些幫助，所以我就請我的同事幫忙。我請她幫我翻譯這個句子然後再傳簡訊給我。
10817	275	5	75	en-US	You mean you sent the Chinese sentence to your co-worker and she translated it into English and sent back to you, is that right? So the message is the answer to your assignment?
10818	275	5	76	zh-TW	對，這封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
10819	275	5	77	en-US	Now let’s take a look at page 14-16 on file 1. Please take a look at it. Are all those messages sent by your co-worker just because you want to do your homework?

10821	275	5	79	en-US	And what’s your explanation about that your wife suspected you have adultery with your co-worker Cai Yan Wang?
10822	275	5	80	zh-TW	我覺得我太太想太多了。我知道她對我無法扶養這個家庭感到不滿意。我希望法庭知道我開始上課時我太太都不支持我。她不願意幫助我得到這個學位。如果她能多一點支持我的話，我就不會請我同事幫忙了。我覺得她該為這個誤會負責。
10823	275	5	81	en-US	According to what you said, it seems that you do not interact with your wife so happily?
10824	275	5	82	zh-TW	剛結婚時我們關係還算好。但問題就是我的工作問題。我想要在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是工作時數一直不穩定。所以工作問題就變成我們2個之間關係的問題了。我們常常為了這個問題吵架，她不相信我已經盡力了，我也無法讓她了解我是多麼的無力還有我面臨的…
10825	275	5	83	en-US	OK, let’s move back to the master program you mentioned. When did your master degree program started? Did you finish it? Did you get the degree?
10826	275	5	84	zh-TW	這個碩士課程從2010年春季開始。它是2年的課程。這個課程應該在12月22日就完成了。我沒有完成這個課程因為我有兼一些工作，所以沒時間做功課。就像我說的，我太太都不支持我，我覺得我都是孤軍奮鬥在完成那個課程的。我覺得非常疲累也非常無力。
10827	275	5	85	en-US	You mean the program is two-year but you didn’t finish it, why?
10828	275	5	86	zh-TW	我無法完成所有課程的要求

10832	275	5	90	zh-TW	我沒完成那個學位並不代表我不想再增進我的語言能力。雖然課程結束了，但是我還是想要學中文
10833	275	5	91	en-US	You mean that although you failed your master degree program, you still want to improve your Chinese competence, is that right?
10834	275	5	92	zh-TW	沒錯，這就是為甚麼我要請我的同事幫忙。
10835	275	5	93	en-US	So the role your co-worker plays is a little like your tutor?
10836	275	5	94	zh-TW	她不只是家教，她也是我真正的朋友
10837	275	5	95	en-US	Do you pay her?
10838	275	5	96	zh-TW	我有說要付錢給她，但她拒絕了
10839	275	5	97	en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why she bothered to send you the message to help you to learn Chinese in the mid-night? Is this behavior just beyond the co-worker’s behavior?
10840	275	5	98	zh-TW	就像我說的，她是非常支持我的朋友，她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文
10841	275	5	99	en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?
10842	275	5	100	zh-TW	是的，我還在那邊工作
10843	275	5	101	en-US	So the co-worker Cai Yan Wang is also working there now?

10848	275	5	106	en-US	I heard that the cram school has take some action about the relationship between my husband and his co-worker. And they tried to persuade to quit the job. I hope that the court can confirm this from the cram school.
10849	275	5	107	en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence you hope the court to investigate? Now the situation is that your master program has finished on December 5th 2012. There is no reason you send the message between you and your co-worker just to finish your assignment. Especially that the messages between your co-worker and you are after 9 pm, it’s a little suspectful. Do you have any evidence that will help you with your case?
10850	275	5	108	zh-TW	我目前想不到任何證據可以請法院幫我調查的。就像我說的，我跟我同事對話目的都沒什麼。我只是想要增進我的語言能力和學中文
10851	275	5	109	en-US	So the cross-questioning procedure will be set at 4:30 pm June 9th 2014. The plaintiff and the defendant, you have to attend the court on that day. If necessary, you can have your lawyer, do you understand?

Also, the plaintiff’s husband constantly make up reasons for extending his shift and have tele-conferencing with his co-worker 王彩燕. The evidence gathered by the plaintiff has shown that her husband and 王彩華has go beyond co-worker’s relationship, therefore consisted this lawsuit.

10884	283	5	37	en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or outside Taiwan?
10885	283	5	38	en-US	We met in Taiwan. Four years ago when he first came to Taiwan, he came to teach Portuguese.
10886	283	5	39	en-US	So in the pass few years, has he been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan?
10887	283	5	40	en-US	He was a Portuguese Teacher when we first met. And after we got married, he still teaches Portuguese. But Portuguese is not that much a popular language, so his working hours are unstable. Sometimes there are even periods between jobs in months. In this sense, he wanted to have a more stable job, so he started teaching English. As English is not his mother tongue, he decided to seek an advance degree.
10888	283	5	41	en-US	You said about seeking a more advance degree. Do you mean he intended to study in Taiwan?
10889	283	5	42	en-US	He wants to teach in Taiwan, so the degree he’s seeking must be related to TESOL. He found a distance learning program of the University of California on the internet. So he doesn’t have to be in the States to get the degree, instead he could get the degree by distant learning. So he can manage to get the degree after he finished all the credits. His plan is that to get the degree licensed by the United states, he could get an English teaching job here in Taiwan.
10890	283	5	43	en-US	So what exactly is the relationship between your husband and his mistress in this case?
10891	283	5	44	en-US	They’re partners and co-workers in cram school. So in the cram school, they have a policy to partner the foreign teacher with the local teacher.
10892	283	5	45	en-US	Then you do you know they’re having an affair?
10893	283	5	46	en-US	At first, the only thing I found was that my husband was lengthening his shift. I asked him isn’t it just a cram school, what’s there to be lengthening your working hours? What he told me was that, since he has to partner with the local teacher therefore he needs more time to practice. I did not doubt him at first. Then after a while, he had been picking up phone calls after his work shifts. And after he picked up the phone, he wouldn’t talk in frond of me, instead he talked in the study room. This made me very suspicious, so I checked his phonebook. 
10894	283	5	47	en-US	Did you find anything unusual in his phonebook?
10895	283	5	48	en-US	I found a constantly dialed number. Being very curious, I also checked his text message. And this was when I discovered that he was contacting this mistress.
10896	283	5	49	en-US	Well, after all it’s just text message, is there anything that’s inappropriate?
10897	283	5	50	en-US	If it was just very simple text message, I wouldn’t go for it. But he’s a married man, how could he let a woman send him some intimate messages? I have provided some evidence for the court, I think they are in the case files.

10901	283	5	54	zh-TW	這只是我同事傳給我的啦, 我記得那時候我剛好修了兩天假, 他大概有點擔心吧所以他才傳這封簡訊, 我的同事是在美國接受教育地所以他的思想非常開放, 那就是他表達的方式啊, 至於說 噢 我的愛  那只是對關心的人表達的一種方式
10902	283	5	55	en-US	So you mean your colleague is more westernized because she studied in the United States. And she’s more open minded in terms of emotions.So the content my love doesn’t have any special meaning right? 
10903	283	5	56	zh-TW	當然不是啊, 這在好朋友和老朋友之間是很正常的表達方式
10904	283	5	57	en-US	How about her previous sentence?
10905	283	5	58	zh-TW	如我所說, 她只是擔心我而已, 我們就是工作的同事/夥伴, 當我請了兩天假, 她很自然而然的想念我
10906	283	5	59	en-US	You mean she sent you this text message just because you didn’t come to work for two days? Without your assistance she missed you? Is that it? 
10907	283	5	60	zh-TW	對啊  最主要就是這樣, 這封簡訊的內容就單純只是這樣而已
10908	283	5	61	en-US	So the second text message was sent at 23:55, 13th of January 2013 from the same cellphone 0958, is that right? 內容是我真的好想你, 希望你真的能陪在我身邊, What do you mean by that? Can you elaborate?
10909	283	5	62	zh-TW	她這麼發訊息只是告訴我我的中文作業理該怎麼表達
10910	283	5	63	en-US	You’re saying that she sent you this message so as to help you huh?
10911	283	5	64	zh-TW	當我太太像法院提出告訴, 我正在休息我的碩士學位, 要取得那個學位我必須先完成30個學分, 我自然而然需要完成一些作業和課業
10912	283	5	65	en-US	Can you explain what exactly are you studying in your master profra
10913	283	5	66	zh-TW	我的學位是英語教學碩士學位, 這學位的內容有部分是英語教學, 那其他部分還包含文化課程和語言能力

10922	283	5	75	en-US	You mean because you asked your colleague about the sentence in Chinese so that’s why she sent it to you in English? So the message was simply an answer for the assignment right?
10923	283	5	76	zh-TW	對  那只是作業的答案
10924	283	5	77	en-US	So now, we’ll see page 14 and 16 in the invest gory file, please check the content. So the colleague sent you these messages because you have problem finishing your assignments.

10930	283	5	83	en-US	Ok, back to the master program we talked about. When did you start your master program? Did you get the degree and are you done with it?
10931	283	5	84	zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始這個課程, 這是兩年的課程, 我原本應該在2012年的12月完成學位, 可是因為工作忙碌的關係, 我並沒有足夠的時間來完成學位要求的一些作業, 就像我說的我太太一直都不支持我, 我覺得我好像自己一個人在為這個學位努力, 我既疲累又身心俱疲.

10943	283	5	96	zh-TW	不, 我想要付她錢, 但她拒絕了
10944	283	5	97	en-US	So if you didn’t pay her, why did she continue to send you these text messages even in sleeping hours? Don’t you think that your relationship was beyond coworkers?

10953	283	5	106	en-US	I heard that the cram school took actions for the relationship of my husband and 王彩燕. The cram school even tried to persuade 王彩燕 to quit the job. Is it possible to ask the cram school whether this is true or not?
10954	283	5	107	en-US	Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence that could help you?Well, the point is your master program should have end on the 5th of December 2012. There’s no reason to keep contact with 王彩燕 because of the assignment right? Especially, you two usually send text message after 9 PM and that’s a little bit weird. Do you have any evidence that could help you?
10955	283	5	108	zh-TW	我不認為庭上有任何能幫助我的證據, 如我所說, 我和我同事連絡的目的非常簡單, 只是想提升我的語言能力繼續進修中文

10979	291	5	27	en-US	Third, you have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you with your case.
10980	291	5	28	en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?
10981	291	5	29	zh-TW	是的，我了解。
10982	291	5	30	en-US	Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The plaintiff, Ms. 陳玉華 filed the case. The reason is that her husband John Anderson has intimate relationship with his colleague. Besides, the plaintiff found that there are some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. Plus, the defendant has often made up reasons for working overtime or chatting with his colleague, Ms. 王彩燕, in the middle of the night via tele-conferencing or other ways. The contents of the messages collected by the plaintiff are considered beyond co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, simply speaking, your wife doubts that you have an affair and accused you of adultery. What’s your plea?
10983	291	5	31	zh-TW	無罪答辯，當然。
10984	291	5	32	en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the major purpose is to ask about the details of phone records between the defendant and his colleague.The purpose is to clarity whether the defendant truly has an affair with his colleague and constitute adultery. Do both parties understand the procedure?
10985	291	5	33	en-US	I understand.
10986	291	5	34	zh-TW	我明白
10987	291	5	35	en-US	First, I will ask the plaintiff some questions. How long have you been married to your husband? Do you have children?
10988	291	5	36	en-US	We have been married for four years, and we don't have children.
10989	291	5	37	en-US	Did you marry your husband abroad or in Taiwan?
10990	291	5	38	en-US	 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and mainly wanted to teach Portuguese. 
10991	291	5	39	en-US	For past few years, is hid job here to teach Portuguese?
10992	291	5	40	en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he had kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hours were unstable. Sometimes, there would be a period of one or two months between two teaching courses. Later on, to make his income more stable, he wanted to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.
10993	291	5	41	en-US	You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean that he would like to pursue a degree in Taiwan?
10994	291	5	42	en-US	No, he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to receive a degree of TESOL. He found a distance learning program offered by California in the United States online. Therefore, he could complete the course requirements by the means of online learning without going to the United States in person. After receiving all the credits, he could receive a master degree. His plan is that with such a degree offered by the United States, he can find a position as an English teacher in Taiwan.
10995	291	5	43	en-US	What is the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?
10996	291	5	44	en-US	The cram school partner a foreign teacher with a Chinese teacher for teaching, and that woman is his teaching partner.
10997	291	5	45	en-US	How do you know your husband has an affair with his colleague?
10998	291	5	46	en-US	At the beginning, I just noticed that my husband often worked overtime at the cram school. I have asked him several times. Why does he have to work overtime at a cram school? He told me that because he had to partner with a Chinese teacher for teaching, many details have to be discussed. 一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，I truly had no doubts on his saying at first. However, I later found out that after he arrived home, he frequently received calls. In addition, he never answered the calls in front of me. Instead, he would go to the study room to talk on the phone. That made me suspect him, so I checked his cellphone.
10999	291	5	47	en-US	Do you find anything unusual in his cellphone?
11000	291	5	48	en-US	I often saw a certain set of numbers in the records of his phone book, so I checked his messages out of curiosity. Then I found that he has texted with a woman almost every single day.
11001	291	5	49	en-US	Is it actually all right with texting messages, right? Is the content very inappropriate?
11002	291	5	50	en-US	If they are common messages, it is fine. However, he is married. How could that woman always send him some intimate sentences? Earlier on, I have provided the court with some contents of their messages. They should be in the file.
11003	291	5	51	en-US	Please show the file one, page 13. There are some contents of several messages. The defendant, please verify whether the messages are from your cellphone?
11004	291	5	52	zh-TW	是的，這些是我手機裡的簡訊。
11005	291	5	53	en-US	 I have some questions for you based on these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50 at night on November 31st in 2012 from the number 0958932 and so on. The content said that “I really miss you, my love.”What does that mean?
11006	291	5	54	zh-TW	這的確是我同事傳的簡訊。她只是關心我、擔心我，所以發簡訊給我。我同事在美國受教育的，她思想很西化，這就是她說話、表達情感的方式。至於「我的愛」一詞，這只是對我們關心的人的稱呼而已。
11007	291	5	55	en-US	You said that the sender was educated abroad, so her thoughts are quite westernised, and the way she expresses herself is more open, so the word “my love”does not carry any special meaning, right?
11008	291	5	56	zh-TW	對，這只是一種普遍稱呼好朋友和關心的人的方式而已。
11009	291	5	57	en-US	And the sentence in front?
11010	291	5	58	zh-TW	像我說的，她只是關心我，我們是工作夥伴。當我休假兩天的時候，她當然會想我。
11011	291	5	59	en-US	Do you mean that because you were off for two days, she sent you such a message, and because without your assistance in the courses, she missed you so much? Is that it?
11012	291	5	60	zh-TW	這就是簡訊內容，並沒有什麼特別的。
11013	291	5	61	en-US	And the second message was sent at 11:55 at night on January 13th, 2013 via the same phone number. The content was that “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?”What does that mean? Why did the sender text you such a message?
11014	291	5	62	zh-TW	她只是告訴我作業中的一句中文怎麼寫而已。
11015	291	5	63	en-US	Do you mean that she sent you this message only for helping you complete your assignment? What does that mean?
11016	291	5	64	zh-TW	像我太太剛剛告訴法院的，我在修一個碩士課程。課程中，我必須完成三十個學分才能拿到學位。我當然必須完成一些作業和習題。
11017	291	5	65	en-US	 Could you elaborate    what you exactly study for your master’s degree?
11018	291	5	66	zh-TW	我修的是英語教學，有些課和英語教學有關，有些跟文化和語言能力有關。
11019	291	5	67	en-US	So you study a master program on TESOL, and some courses are related to culture communications, right?
11020	291	5	68	zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三門課和文化溝通有關
11021	291	5	69	en-US	What kind of assignments were be given by such courses of culture and communication?
11022	291	5	70	zh-TW	這些文化溝通課程的作業因學生而異。以我自己為例。我住在台灣，想要找到教英文的工作。為了達成這個目標，並精進語文能力，我必須有好的中文能力。因此，我有很多作業跟中英翻譯有關。
11023	291	5	71	en-US	Do you mean that because you planned to teach English in Taiwan, this program requires you to prove you have a certain level of Chinese ability? And therefore, you have to complete some assignments give by the courses, which is sentence translation? Is that right?
11024	291	5	72	zh-TW	對的，我當然必須精進我的口說和寫作能力。
11025	291	5	73	en-US	All right, let’s go back to that sentence. You said that was your assignment, right?
11026	291	5	74	zh-TW	是的，我記得這個句子。我剛開始不知道那些中文句子用英文該怎麼說。有些中文字對外國人來說很難認。我需要一些協助，所以請同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯句子，用簡訊傳給我。
11027	291	5	75	en-US	Do you mean that you asked your colleague how to say that sentence in Chinese, and she texted you the answer? Is that the scenario? In other words, the content of the message is only the answer to the assignment, right?
11028	291	5	76	zh-TW	簡訊內容就是我的作業答案。
11029	291	5	77	en-US	Then please show the contents of all the messages on page 14 to page 16 in the file one. Please verify the messages. Is it because that you has to do your assignments and ask for help from your colleague, asking her to send you messages?
11030	291	5	78	zh-TW	是的，所有簡訊都是為了幫助我完成作業。
11031	291	5	79	en-US	Your wife just said that you have an affair with your colleague, 王彩燕, what is your explanation? 
11032	291	5	80	zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了！我想她只是不滿意我賺錢的能力。我想告訴庭上，我太太從一開始就完全不支持我念碩士，她並不願意幫助我完成學業。如果她願意支持我一點點，我不會請同事幫忙。我覺得她自己應該為這誤解負責。
11033	291	5	81	en-US	According to your saying, there are some unpleasant situations between you and your wife?
11034	291	5	82	zh-TW	剛結婚的時候，我們的確渡過了一段美好時光，但是問題出在我的工作。我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是授課時數很不穩定，所以我的工作就成了我們之間的問題。我們常常為這個問題吵架。她不相信我已經盡力了，我也無法讓她理解我遇到的挫折和困難。
11035	291	5	83	en-US	Well, let’s go back to the master program, which you just talked about. When did you start your program, and does it end? Did you receive the degree? 
11036	291	5	84	zh-TW	我的碩士課程從2010年春天開始，是兩年的課程，應該要在2012年12月完成課程。但是我沒有完成課程，因為我有兼差，沒有時間完成我的課程作業。像我說的，我太太並不支持我。我覺得是自己一路單獨奮鬥，感覺很累、很有挫折。
11037	291	5	85	en-US	Do you mean that the program should have lasted for two years, but you did not complete it, and why?
11038	291	5	86	zh-TW	我無法完成所有的課程要求。
11039	291	5	87	en-US	What did it end, the last semester that you registered? 
11040	291	5	88	zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是在2012年秋季。
11041	291	5	89	en-US	If as you said, your last semester ended on December 5th in 2012, based on reasonable doubts, you would have no assignments after that, right? How would you continue sending messages with your colleagues even until six months after the program was ended?
11042	291	5	90	zh-TW	我也許無法完成課程，但不代表我不想精進語言能力。即使我不能完成課程，我還是很想加強我的中文能力，所以我繼續自我學習。
11043	291	5	91	en-US	Do you mean that even though  you failed to complete the master program, you still want to sharpen your Chinese ability and make your Chinese more fluent, right?
11044	291	5	92	zh-TW	是，我請同事幫忙。
11045	291	5	93	en-US	So that colleague plays a role as a tutor, right?
11046	291	5	94	zh-TW	她不僅是個家教，也是我真正的好友。
11047	291	5	95	en-US	Have you offered her any pay?
11048	291	5	96	zh-TW	沒有，我想要付她錢，但她拒絕了。
11049	291	5	97	en-US	If you had not paid her, why would she like to send you messages to answer your questions even in the middle of the night, when she should go to bed for sleep?
11050	291	5	98	zh-TW	因此我認為她是非常支持我的，她用自己的時間幫助我學習中文。
11051	291	5	99	en-US	Do you still work as an English teacher at that cram school now?
11052	291	5	100	zh-TW	是的，我還在那裡工作。
11053	291	5	101	en-US	Is that colleague, 王彩燕, still working there, too?
11054	291	5	102	zh-TW	她也還在那裡工作，但我們不再是工作夥伴了。
11055	291	5	103	en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any further evidence to be investigated or people to be subpoenaed? 
11056	291	5	104	en-US	We would like to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, 王彩燕, as a witness to the court to elaborate her relationship with the defendant and the background as well as the purpose of writing these messages?
11057	291	5	105	en-US	The plaintiff, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you?
11058	291	5	106	en-US	I have heard that the cram school has taken some actions because of their relationship. The cram school even tried to persuade Ms. 王彩燕 to leave the job position. I am wandering whether we can verify these facts with the cram school.
11059	291	5	107	en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? The current situation is that your master program was ended on December 5th, 2012, and there are no reasons for you to take completing assignments as an excuse to explain the interaction of texting messages between you and 王彩燕, especially your interactions were mostly after 9 o’clock at night. This behaviour causes doubts. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?
11060	291	5	108	zh-TW	我無法想到有任何證據是法院可以代表我調查的。如我所說，我和同事間的溝通很簡單。我只是想要精進中文能力，繼續學習中文。
11061	291	5	109	en-US	The next court date is set at 4:30 in the afternoon on June 9th, 2014 for asking the witness. The plaintiff and the defendant, please do  come on that day. If necessary, the both parties have the right to hire lawyers. Do you understand?

11108	433	6	51	zh-TW	沒錯，我是從朋友還有一些註冊會員那邊聽到這些小細節的。
11109	433	6	52	en-US	How could you repost this information on Foreign Land?
11110	433	6	53	zh-TW	我沒有直接引用，我只是發表言論、提出我的問題。我只是希望贏贏公司可以釐清這些問題，讓外國人不會對這家公司有誤解。
11111	433	6	54	en-US	What do you mean that you criticize in questions? Can you explain it?
11112	433	6	55	zh-TW	舉例來說，我發表了一個問題，就是那個公司有沒有幫外國人申請居留證，外國人可以合法居留嗎?
11113	433	6	56	en-US	So, you posted a series of comments just in order to find out the truth?
11114	433	6	57	zh-TW	是的，我只是想要得到一些澄清和解釋。然而，這個公司沒有直接回答我的問題，而是對我提出告訴。
11115	433	6	58	en-US	Although the accuser provided some comments from Foreign Land and told the police, but the content wasn’t entire. …
11116	433	6	59	zh-TW	我之前說過的，那些文章已經發表一段時間了，所以我不能明確告訴你我發了多少文章到論壇，也許是8到10篇。問題是當他們提出告訴後，版主就把我的文章全部刪除，以免造成麻煩。
11117	433	6	60	en-US	You mean when the lawsuit began, the administrator of the forum deleted all of your posts, right?
11118	433	6	61	zh-TW	是這樣沒錯。
11119	433	6	62	en-US	That is, you can’t assure how many comments you posted, right?
11120	433	6	63	zh-TW	這樣也沒錯。
11121	433	6	64	en-US	Did you remember that the company asked you to stop criticizing? Did you stop posting comments?
11122	433	6	65	zh-TW	我認為如果要我停止發文的話，我應該會收到一些叫我停止發文的請求，我沒有立即停止，因為就像我前面所說的，我只是問問題而已。
11123	433	6	66	en-US	So, you mean you insist on posting comments in question, but not libeling the company, right?
11124	433	6	67	zh-TW	我從來都不是故意要毀謗這個公司，我不懂為什麼問問題會造成毀謗。
11125	433	6	68	en-US	Now, I’m going to ask accuser some questions. Accuser, when do you realize that some comments are posted on Foreign Land about your company?
11126	433	6	69	zh-TW	我第一次知道此事是在2019年12月。我和我老婆在這樣的論壇並不活躍。我們是在那時才被朋友告知有這些惡意評論。
11127	433	6	70	en-US	According to the accused, he just posted a series of questions and hoped that the company can respond to him. He didn’t say something directly to defame your company. Did you have any opinion?
11128	433	6	71	zh-TW	這不是事實。在英文表達中，即使用問題方式評論，也能讓閱讀的人產生好奇或質疑事實。即使被告說他只是問問題，也足以毀謗我的公司。
11129	433	6	72	en-US	Do you meant that whether the other party posted the questions, the company has been defamed? Can you explain?
11130	433	6	73	zh-TW	是的。當被告問了這些問題，就能讓這些住在台灣的外國人懷疑這間公司。這些外國人在這個論壇裡自成一圈。在這圈子裡，謠言傳得非常快。這就是爲什麼勞工局多次造訪我的公司，來看這些評論中的問題是否真的存在。
11131	433	6	74	en-US	When the Labor Bureau went to the company to understand the situation of hiring the foreigner and their application of ARC, did anything happen which didn’t meet the requirements?
11132	433	6	75	zh-TW	沒有，勞工局派的代表並沒有查到任何不符規定的事。
11133	433	6	76	en-US	If the Labor Bureau didn’t find anything which is illegal or not appropriate, just like the accused explained that he wrote these articles only to hope that the company can clarify, can both parties consider settlement?
11134	433	6	77	zh-TW	我們之前有試著調解，但失敗了。我可以考慮和解，但對被告有兩件事的要求。第一，他必須為他不妥言論，正式向我的公司道歉。第二，如他剛才所說他是從其他外國朋友中聽到這些消息，他必須提供這些朋友的全名
11135	433	6	78	en-US	The accused, just like accuser said, if you want a settlement, you need to take two actions. First, you need to apologize formally. For the comments you posted on Foreign Land, whether they constituted defamation, you need to apologize. Second, you have mentioned that you heard these things from your foreign friend. The company treated the employees illegally. Can you provide the names of your friends?
11136	433	6	79	zh-TW	不，我拒絕接受這些條件。第一點，我不懂為什麼我要為這些言論道歉，什麼時候問問題也犯法？第二，他不應該要我公開這些外國朋友的全名。
11137	433	6	80	en-US	The accused, you insist that you wrote the comments in questions, and you didn’t intend to defame the company, so you won’t apologize, right?
11138	433	6	81	zh-TW	對，我拒絕道歉。
11139	433	6	82	en-US	You also reject the second condition. Is that because you afraid that the company will file a lawsuit against your foreign friends?
11140	433	6	83	zh-TW	我擔心那些曾在那邊工作或是目前在那工作的朋友受害。我怎麼可以出賣這些朋友，就因為我想達成和解？為什麼他們要遭到這些傷害？
11141	433	6	84	en-US	The accuser, if both parties cannot reach a settlement, the court will collect the details for preparatory procedure and have next trial procedure. Today both parties have their lawyers. The lawyers of both parties, can you negotiate with your clients about settlement?
11142	433	6	85	en-US	Dear judge, I am the lawyer of the accuser. We used to negotiate with the defendant. The defendant said he heard information from his friends. He can provide their full names, so this case will be dismissed here. However, the defendant didn’t want to cooperate so we couldn’t reach an agreement.
11143	433	6	86	en-US	Dear judge, I am the lawyer of the accused. The reason why my client has these concerns is because the accuser’s company applies many foreign employees. My client doesn’t want to provide the names of his foreign friends because he doesn’t want his friends to get into trouble. Hope you can understand.
11144	433	6	87	en-US	Because both parties don’t reach a settlement, so the date of the trial procedure will set at 11 a.m. on August 14, 2020.
11145	433	6	88	en-US	The defendant, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate?
11146	433	6	89	zh-TW	沒有，親愛的法官大人。
11147	433	6	90	en-US	The accuser, do you have any evidence you hope the court to investigate for you?
11148	433	6	91	zh-TW	如果我有想到任何問題，我會請律師告知庭上。
11149	433	6	92	en-US	About the next court date, we will not issue the subpoena. We will give you orange cards to inform you. Please sign your statement… The court is dismissed today.

11175	456	6	33	en-US	As stated in the indictment. 
11176	456	6	34	en-US	The defendant, you are prosecuted for defamation. The reason is because during umm… December 1st, 2019 to January 20th, 2020, you posted a thread of comments on the social media on the Internet called Foreign Land. This platform’s intention is to let foreigners who live in Taiwan to communicate with each other, but you used this platform to criticize the accuser’s company, and defamed the company. And damaged the company’s reputation. As for the defamation crime, what’s your plea?
11177	456	6	35	zh-TW	我沒有罪。
11178	456	6	36	en-US	Defendant, do you know the internet platform Foreign Land?
11179	456	6	37	zh-TW	我知道，因為外國園地在外國人…在我們外國人之間是很受歡迎的論壇。

11181	456	6	39	zh-TW	我是有註冊的會員，就是我可以看別人的文章，我也可以發布文章讓其他人看。
11182	456	6	40	en-US	So, do you often post comments on this platform
11183	456	6	41	zh-TW	我不會說我常常在上面發文，我只有在..我只有在我關心的事情或我想要抒發情緒的時候才會發。
11184	456	6	42	en-US	Next, I am going to inform the investigatory paper number 1 page 65. This page is from the comments on Foreign Land December 13th, 2019. Is this the comments you posted?
11185	456	6	43	zh-TW	這個看起來像是我發的，但是在很久以前，所以我也沒有辦法確定文章的完整度。
11186	456	6	44	en-US	Please state what you posted… the content of what you posted.
11187	456	6	45	zh-TW	就像你所看到的一樣，我..我發表了 對於文文公司的問題，然後揭露外國人在這家公司是怎麼被對待的。
11188	456	6	46	en-US	You have mentioned the company’s name. Do you remember if you have posted the full name of the company in any of your posts?
11189	456	6	47	zh-TW	恩對阿，我有用公司的本名，文文。
11190	456	6	48	en-US	As stated in page 65, you stated that this company when hiring foreigners, they didn’t follow the Basic Labor Law of paying basic wage, and the time and rights. And you also mentioned that the company didn’t apply for foreigner’s visa, is this true?
11191	456	6	49	zh-TW	我的確有聽到這些問題，但我沒有證據。我是從曾經在那家公司工作過的外國人那邊聽到這些消息的。因此我發表了我的意見…我用問的方式發表我的意見，其中提到了這個公司的基本工時、工資還有居留證的問題，希望文文公司可以….看到並且改善。
11192	456	6	50	en-US	Do you mean that you heard this from foreigner friends and this information is not first hand?
11193	456	6	51	zh-TW	沒錯，我是從朋友那邊聽來的，還有論壇上註冊的會員他們也這麼說。
11194	456	6	52	en-US	Then how can you… how can you post these comments on a public platform which is not first hand information?
11195	456	6	53	zh-TW	我並沒有直接的….ㄟ…直接控告他所做的事情，我都用詢問的方式。我希望文文公司他們可以澄清這些不好的訊息，這樣子外國人也不會對他有不好的印象。
11196	456	6	54	en-US	What do you mean by you criticized by asking questions? Can you explain this?
11197	456	6	55	zh-TW	舉例來說，我說文文公司他沒有幫外國人申請居留證……也就是在台灣工作的……..
11198	456	6	56	en-US	So, the intention of you posting these comments is just to find out the truth?
11199	456	6	57	zh-TW	是的，我只是希望他可以澄清並且給大家一個交代。然而，文文公司不但沒有直接回答我的問題，反而是對我提起訴訟。
11200	456	6	58	en-US	Although the accuser provided some comments from Foreign Land, they have said that these comments are not a whole. How many posts did you post on this platform?
11201	456	6	59	zh-TW	 就像我說過的，我偶爾會發，但是我沒有辦法確切記得我到底發了幾篇，我想大概是在8~10篇的範圍內，問題是當文文公司提起訴訟的時候，外國園地的版主決定刪掉我寫的那些文章來避免麻煩。
11202	456	6	60	en-US	Do you mean after the lawsuit was filed, the administrator of Foreign Land just deleted all the posts?
11203	456	6	61	zh-TW	沒有錯。
11204	456	6	62	en-US	This also means that you cannot be sure that you posted… how many comments you posted about this incident, right?
11205	456	6	63	zh-TW	恩，你說的沒錯。
11206	456	6	64	en-US	As far as you can remember, did the company tell you to stop your comments? And did you do so?
11207	456	6	65	zh-TW	沒錯，文文公司確實有要求我停止再發布這些文章，但我並沒有馬上停止這麼做，就像我說過的阿，我只是問問題而已。
11208	456	6	66	en-US	So, the defendant, you mean you only criticized the company by asking questions and do not admit that you libeled the company, right?
11209	456	6	67	zh-TW	妨害文文公司的名譽從來不是我的目的，我真的不能理解這些我問的問題會構成妨害名譽
11210	456	6	68	en-US	Then I am going to ask the accuser some questions. So, the accuser, when do you realize that the accused post some articles on the Foreign Land about your company?
11211	456	6	69	zh-TW	這個事件，我們公司第一次注意到這件事是在2019年的12月。我和我的老婆並沒有在那個論壇裡面很活躍。我們當時是被朋友告知有這些惡意的言論在該論壇上。
11212	456	6	70	en-US	Just.. as what the accused mentioned, he said that he just… he just post the article by asking questions instead of statement… instead of…instead of post the article in the form of statement.
11213	456	6	71	zh-TW	在英文裡面，即使是問問題的形式，文字也有足夠的力量可以讓閱讀的人覺得或懷疑那些事實。所以當被告說他用問問題的方式，也足以妨害我們公司的名譽。
11214	456	6	72	en-US	Do you mean that, no matter…whether the accused use the …use the …the accused use …asking question form. Your …still be damage….
11215	456	6	73	zh-TW	是的，當被告她提出這些疑問的時候就在我們外國人的圈子裡面造成非常大的懷疑和不信任。外國人在台灣有自己的圈子，然後在這個圈子裏面有很多流言和消息都傳得很快。這就是為什麼台灣的勞工局多次造訪我們，也想要知道我們是否有捲進這起事件裡面。
11216	456	6	74	en-US	So when the Labor Bureau come to your company, do they found out that your…the hiring conditions, ARC application is not reasonable?
11217	456	6	75	zh-TW	沒有，當勞工局的代表來的時候，他們沒有發現任何的問題。僱人方面也沒有任何問題。
11218	456	6	76	en-US	So if the…if your hiring conditions and ARC application is…are nothing wrong. And the accused just hope that you can give a self-clarification. So will you consider to settle with him
11219	456	6	77	zh-TW	我們之前已經嘗試過和解了，但我們沒有達到任何的協議。要我跟被告人進行和解，我有兩個條件。第一，他必須對文文公司提出非常的道歉。第二，他說他都是從其他外國朋友得知這些消息，所以他想要自清的話就需要提供這些人的全名。
11220	456	6	78	en-US	The accused, just as what the accuser said, if you wan to settle, you need to take two actions that he requested. First, you need to apologize formally. According to your article, no matter…no matter the company…the company’s reputation was damaged, you need to apologize to them. Second, you said that you heard your friends tell you that the company…the company is illegal of the hiring rules. Can you provide those people’s name?
11221	456	6	79	zh-TW	不，我拒絕接受這兩個條件。第一，我不知道為什麼我只是發表一些評論就要道歉。從什麼時候開始問問題是一種罪? 第二，文文公司想要進行和解的方式是要公開我外國朋友的全名，我覺得這樣不合理。
11222	456	6	80	en-US	The defendant, the accused, you insist that you just asking questions instead of Libel, so you refuse to apologize, right?
11223	456	6	81	zh-TW	對，我拒絕道歉。
11224	456	6	82	en-US	The reason why you refuse the second condition is because you afraid that the accuser will take a legal action against those foreign friends, right?
11225	456	6	83	zh-TW	我擔心的是因為目前有人曾經或現在都還在文文公司工作。我怎麼可以出賣他們，就為了這個案子? 為什麼他們必須受到波及呢?
11226	456	6	84	en-US	The accuser…if the both parties cannot settle, we will consider…we will consider to…collect the information of this court and…have the next court. Today the both parties have their lawyers, so the lawyer of both parties, can you talk to your…clients about settlement?
11227	456	6	85	en-US	Your honor, I am the accuser’s lawyer. Your honor, we have actually negotiated with the accused. As he said, he only heard all these information from his foreigner friends, he could just provide the full names of these friends and the case would be closed. But the defendant is very uncooperative, so we cannot take a further step to settle this case.
11228	456	6	86	en-US	Your honor, I’m the accused’s lawyer. The reason why my client is concerned is because there are many foreigners work in the company. My client didn’t…my client isn’t willing to provide his friends’ name just because he didn’t want those foreigners work in the company get into troubles. Please understand.
11229	456	6	87	en-US	Since both parties have their own concerns and stances, the next court will be set at 11 o’clock on August 14th 2020. We will have a trial procedure
11230	456	6	88	en-US	The accused, do you have evidence that need the court to help you investigate?
11231	456	6	89	zh-TW	沒有。
11232	456	6	90	en-US	How about the accuser? Are there any evidence you want the court to investigate? 
11233	456	6	91	zh-TW	我會好好想想，如果有想到任何東西的話，我會請我的律師告知庭上。

11276	461	6	49	zh-TW	我有提到這件事情但我還沒有證據。我有從一些外國朋友口中聽說，而那些朋友都是在公司工作或是和那些人交手過的。所以我用問問題的方式來表達我的想法，我的意思是我的問題都是有關勞基法、基本工時、基本薪資以及福利，以及雙贏公司是怎麼對外國居留證申請的方式，所以我希望他們可以出面澄清這個問題。
11277	461	6	50	en-US	So you mean that you obtain this information from other friends, and these details are not firsthand information, right?
11278	461	6	51	zh-TW	沒錯我就是從其他外國朋友那邊聽來的，以及從外國園地的註冊會員。
11279	461	6	52	en-US	So how can you in such public forum and directly state what you have heard on the post?
11280	461	6	53	zh-TW	我並沒有引述其他人說的話在我的貼文當中，也不是控告的形式，我只是用問題的方式呈現。我只是希望雙贏公司可以提供某些形式的澄清，所以在我們的社群當中，才不會給外國人有錯誤的印象。
11281	461	6	54	en-US	What do you mean by asking questions? Could you explain further?
11282	461	6	55	zh-TW	舉例來說，我曾在一篇貼文問說，雙贏公司是否真的沒有幫助外國人申請居留證，也就是他們可以合法在台工作的權利。
11283	461	6	56	en-US	So your purposes of this post are finding out the truth, right?
11284	461	6	57	zh-TW	是的，我只想要得到他們的澄清或解釋。然而，他們並沒有直接的回應我，雙贏公司選擇了控告我的方式。
11285	461	6	58	en-US	Although the accuser provide some articles contents, they have informed that these informations are not complete. How many post have you posts?
11286	461	6	59	zh-TW	就像我之前說過的，這些貼文已經有段時間了，就我記憶所及，大概只能想起來我大概發了8到10篇。問題是，當他們對我提出告訴時，版主就會刪除這些文章來避免不必要的麻煩。
11287	461	6	60	en-US	What you meant was when the lawsuit came to effect, the administrator will delete all the post?
11288	461	6	61	zh-TW	沒錯。
11289	461	6	62	en-US	That is you still aren’t that sure how many post you have posted upon this issue?
11290	461	6	63	zh-TW	也沒錯。
11291	461	6	64	en-US	In your memory, did the company send you any requirement or warning to stop posting?
11292	461	6	65	zh-TW	在我停止發文之前，都沒有收到任何要我停止發文的消息。我沒有立即停止發文，因為就像我之前所說的，我只是在問問題而已。
11293	461	6	66	en-US	So the defendant, you still insist that you are posting in the form of posting questions, instead of directly libeling the company to damage their reputation. Is that right?
11294	461	6	67	zh-TW	我從來就沒有想過要妨害雙贏公司的名譽。我還是不太了解一連串的問題會構成妨害名譽或毀謗。
11295	461	6	68	en-US	Next I will ask the plaintiff some questions. Plaintiff, when did you find that there are some comments about your company?
11296	461	6	69	zh-TW	這些問題主要首次是在2019年12月我們有意識到。我跟我老婆一開始並沒有在這個論壇上很活躍。我們是在朋友跟我們告知有這些惡意的評論之後才意識到這件事情。
11297	461	6	70	en-US	The defendent said that he didn‘t he just wrote the comment in the form of asking questions instead of statements. About this, what’s your idea?
11298	461	6	71	zh-TW	這不對。這在英文裡面，即使是用問題的形式，它也是有強力的作用去質疑事實。也就是說，當被告問了這些問題的時候，他對我們的公司就造成了毁謗、造成我們的名譽受損。
11299	461	6	72	en-US	Can you make a further explanation that no matter the defendant used the question or not, your company...the reputation of your company is still damaged?
11300	461	6	73	zh-TW	沒錯，被告的確造成了一些質疑。公司的確受到損害了，因為這些謠言都已經傳遍了。台灣的勞工局也有來造訪我們，去試圖找出我們是否牽涉其中。
11301	461	6	74	en-US	So when Labor Bureau went to visit your company and asked you about the your hiring and applying for ARC, are there any violations of your rule?
11302	461	6	75	zh-TW	沒有，他們有過來探視但沒有發現任何問題，在申請上面都沒有問題。
11303	461	6	76	en-US	If the Labor Bureau did not find anything wrong in your company. Furthermore, the aim of the defendant’s asking your question is to want to get your self-clarification; as a result, is there any chance for you to make a settlement?
11304	461	6	77	zh-TW	我們之前有試過，但最後都沒有達到任何共識。我只對這個被告要求兩件事。第一件事情，我只希望他能公開道歉，說明他對外國園地的毀謗。第二，就像他說的，他是從其他人那邊聽到這些消息細節的，他應該要提供到底確切是從哪些人聽到的。
11305	461	6	78	en-US	Defendant, as the accuser required, if you want to reach a settlement, you have to take the following two actions...the above mentioned two actions. First, you have to apologize formally. Regarding your posts on the Foreign Land, no matter you had caused damage to their reputation... As you mentioned before, you have heard these rumors from your foreign friends, and could you please provide those friends’ names, since you are suspected of violating defamation.
11306	461	6	79	zh-TW	不，我不會考慮以上兩個方式。首先，我還是不懂為什麼我只是問一些問題就要受到處罰。從什麼時候開始問問題變成一種罪？第二，雙贏公司並不同意要和解，若是我提供這些人的姓名。
11307	461	6	80	en-US	The defendant you insist that you are writing these posts in the form of asking questions, so you refuse to apologize, right?
11308	461	6	81	zh-TW	不，我並不考慮要道歉。
11309	461	6	82	en-US	As for the second request of the accuser, do you worry that your foreign friends will be filed a lawsuit against?
11310	461	6	83	zh-TW	重點是，有些友人是曾經或是現在正在雙贏工作的。我怎麼忍心讓他們暴露在危險當中，只是為了要和解？為什麼他們要暴露在這些潛在的危險當中？
11311	461	6	84	en-US	The accuser if you don’t want to make any compromise against this settlement, we will gathering this information together to be the next court’s evidence.

The plaintiff…the plaintiff…the plaintiff wanted to file the case against his… her husband for… for the suspect that he is having an affair with his coworkers. Because she has found some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphones, and, sometimes, her husband would make up reasons for extra hours for the… his work. Also, he would have tele-conference with his coworkers, so the plaintiff is suspect that her husband has a relationship with his coworker beyond coworker’s relationship.

11542	298	8	37	en-US	We have been married for 4 years, and we didn’t.. and we don’t have kids.
11543	298	8	38	en-US	So…did you and your husband get married in Taiwan, or you get married in foreign country?
11544	298	8	39	en-US	My husband and I met in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he was here to teach Portuguese.
11545	298	8	40	en-US	Then, during the past few years, is his job in Taiwan teaching Portuguese?
11546	298	8	41	en-US	When we first met, he was a teacher to teach Portuguese. Then, after we get married, he still teaching Portuguese. However, in Taiwan, Portuguese is not a popular language to learn from, so, sometimes, he didn’t have a… his teaching hour is not stable or regular, and sometimes, there are a period between jobs that is as long as a month or even two month. Then , in order to have a steady and stable incomes, he decided to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree on English.
11547	298	8	42	en-US	You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. It means that he seek an advanced degree in Taiwan?
11548	298	8	43	en-US	No, because he wanted to teach English, so the degree of his seeking has to be about English teaching. He found an Internet courses about distance learning program in the University of California, and this course is that he doesn’t have to go to America to learn, but he can have a distance learning in Taiwan about English teaching. So after he finishes all the credits of the internet courses, then he can get a master degree. Therefore, he can use this American advanced degree to English teaching job in Taiwan.
11549	298	8	44	en-US	Then... What is his relationship with the person he had affair with?
11550	298	8	45	en-US	They are the coworkers in the cram school. And in the cram school, they have a program that a Chinese teacher would partner up with an foreign teacher, so the woman is his partner.
11551	298	8	46	en-US	How do you know that they are having an affair?
11552	298	8	47	en-US	At the beginning, I found out that he started to work over hours, so I confronted with him that why he has to spend so much time in a English cram school. And he told me that he have to communicate with the Chinese teacher, so he has to spend the extra hours. So I told him that it just a cram school, why should he spend another hours. At first, I didn’t doubt him. Then I found out that he would answer some calls. And when he answer that phone, he didn’t talk in front of me. He went to the study room to have the phone call. And then I examine his phone, the texts he got, then I found out that there are something wrong.
11553	298	8	48	en-US	So… in his phone, did you find anything unusual?
11554	298	8	49	en-US	First, I look up his phone book. Then I found out that there is a same number that calls over and over. And then I found out that the texts he got are all from the same person, the same woman. Then I realize that he and that woman text every single day.
11555	298	8	50	en-US	Even though they are texting, it is alright. It is not a big deal. The context is fine. It’s not horrible, right?
11556	298	8	51	en-US	If it was a very normal and regular text, it would be fine. But he is a married man, and in the texts, there are some intimate message, and those message I have already filed to the court as the evidence.
11557	298	8	52	en-US	As you can see the exhibit 1, there was the context of the message, and I would like to ask the defendant, are those messages from your cellphone?
11558	298	8	53	zh-TW	是的，這是我手機裡的訊息。
11559	298	8	54	en-US	If that’s so, I would like to ask you some questions about these message. The first, I would like to ask the text from the cellphone number 0958932123 on December 21st, 2018. The time was 9:50 p.m. And in the context, it was written, “I really miss you my love.” What did it mean?
11560	298	8	55	zh-TW	那個簡訊是從我的同事那傳給我的，那時候我請了兩天假，然後他就覺得有點小擔心，然後傳簡訊來關心我一下而已。我的同事是在美國受的教育，所以他才會這麼的開放，那這些說話方式也只是她表達他自己的一些說法，那剛剛提到的那個my love，也就只是我們稱我們關心的人的親暱的名字。
11561	298	8	56	en-US	So what you mean is that, the person was educated in the west, so her mind is westernized. And therefore, the way she express her emotion and feelings are more open? And so…the phrase “my love” is not a big deal and didn’t mean anything.
11562	298	8	57	zh-TW	是的，那只是我們在比較親密的朋友之間會稱呼彼此的方式而已。
11563	298	8	58	en-US	How about the first part of the message?
11564	298	8	59	zh-TW	就像我剛剛說的阿，他就只是擔心我而已，因為那時候…我們兩個是工作上的搭檔。所以在我請兩天假的時候，他就是非常的擔心我。
11565	298	8	60	en-US	So what you mean is that the person…when you are away, she needs your assistance during the teaching, so she sent you the message to express her worries and concerns,. Is that what you mean?
11566	298	8	61	zh-TW	是的，那就是這簡訊的意義，所以這封簡訊根本就沒有什麼大不了的。
11567	298	8	62	en-US	Then, we will examine the second message. It was sent by the same cellphone. And the time was on December 29th, 2017 at 11:55 p.m. It was written, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this text mean? Could you explain?
11568	298	8	63	zh-TW	他寫這個訊息就只是想要問我說，在我的中文文本中要怎麼翻成英文。
11569	298	8	64	en-US	So you mean is that she sent you the message in order to help you to accomplish your homework? What does it even mean? 
11570	298	8	65	zh-TW	就像我太太剛剛在前面的時候跟法庭告知的，我現在在上一堂就是碩士的課程，那這整個課程有三十個學分，那為了要完成這三十個學分，裡面難免會有些作業跟一些練習，那我當然要完成這些東西。
11571	298	8	66	en-US	Could you first explain what did you major in for your master degree?
11572	298	8	67	zh-TW	我的主修是在英語教學，那在其中的一些課程安排上，就是有些英語教學的課程沒錯，那來有另一個部分是關於文化以及語言能力的一些課程，那就當然其中有一些...這些東西。
11573	298	8	68	en-US	So you mean that the field you choose is TESOL, there are some culture and language communication in the course?
11574	298	8	69	zh-TW	是的，我印象中是起碼有三堂課跟文化語言溝通有關的課。
11575	298	8	70	en-US	So what is the assignment which is related to the cultural and language communication?
11576	298	8	71	zh-TW	這堂課程的作業在每個學生身上都不太一樣。那以我為例的話，因為我現在在台灣，然後想要取得英文教學的工作，那為了要達成這個目標，那勢必我是一定要有能力去掌握中文。所以我有很多的作業是要怎麼中翻英或是英翻中。
11577	298	8	72	en-US	Therefore, in order to fulfill the plan that you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to finish and complete the assignment or translate English into Chinese, or Chinese into English?
11578	298	8	73	zh-TW	是的，而同時間我也被耀球說我要精進我的口說及寫作的能力。
11579	298	8	74	en-US	Okay, then we will go back to the texts we have been presenting, so the text was your assignment?
11580	298	8	75	zh-TW	是的，那就是我的作業，那在當時的時候，我拿到句子的時候，我完全不知道要怎麼翻，你也知道，就是中文有些詞彙就是很難翻譯成英文，所以在當時我拿到作業時，我完全不知道該怎麼翻譯，所以我就是向我的同事求助，那我就請他在翻完之後，將翻譯傳簡訊給我。
11581	298	8	76	en-US	Well, according by your claim, that this text message was only the question of your assignment. And the college is only translate the assignment for you and give you the answer. Is that what you claim?
11582	298	8	77	zh-TW	對，那個內容只是我功課的答案而已。
11583	298	8	78	en-US	Okay, now the defendant please read the exhibit 1, page 14 to page 16, are all these messages the answers of your assignment for your master degree?
11584	298	8	79	zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊內容都只是為了要完成我的作業。
11585	298	8	80	en-US	Well… what’s your explanation about your wife suspect that you are having an affair with your coworker. What’s your explanation?
11586	298	8	81	zh-TW	我太太真的是在這件事情上想太多了，我一直知道他一直很不滿意我養家活口的能力，而在我一開始要在去進修，取得碩士學位的時候後，他就完全沒有表現出支持我的舉動或是…沒有任何支持。因為她一直沒有就是表現出任何支持，所以我就沒有想要去問他，或是請他幫我完成這些作業，而我就覺得說，他就是這整個誤解的罪魁禍首。
11587	298	8	82	en-US	According to your explanation, it seems that there are some unhappiness between you and your wife?
11588	298	8	83	zh-TW	在一開始新婚的時候，我們的確過得很愉快，但是就是主要問題就是我的工作，因為在我一開始在這裡教授葡萄牙文，但是一直碰壁又碰到困難，就變成了我們主要的問題。所以就，我的工作就變成我們吵架的問題，我們就時常為了這種問題吵架，然後這整個狀況，造成我非常的沮喪、非常的洩氣、非常的挫折。
11589	298	8	84	en-US	Okay, then we’ll go back to your master degree. When did you start your master degree? Do you finish it? And when will you get your diplomat?
11590	298	8	85	zh-TW	我是在2015年的秋天註冊的，就開始這個課程那他預計是兩年的課程，那我應該會是在2017年的五月的時候畢業，但是我一直沒有完成這個學位是因為我一直都有一些兼職工作，所以我就沒有時間去完成我的那些作業。就像我剛剛提到的，就我太太一直都沒有很支持我的這個決定，所以在整個求學過程中我一直覺得很沮喪，而且很累，所以我就還沒有拿到這個學位。
11591	298	8	86	en-US	So you just mentioned that this program is designed for 2 years, and you didn’t finish it, so what is the main reason of that?
11592	298	8	87	zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有的課程作業，還有一些課程的要求。

11594	298	8	89	zh-TW	我最後一個學期是在2017年的春天註冊的。
11595	298	8	90	en-US	So if it is true, as you just mentioned, that the course has already finish in May, 2017. So it is reasonable that after the course you didn’t have any assignment. But after the semester has ended, during the 7 months you have the text message with your coworker, what’s the purpose.
11596	298	8	91	zh-TW	就算我沒有完成我的學位，也不代表說我就不要再精進我的語言能力，所以在這個課程結束後，我就還是做一些作業、一些練習，就是我是自學啦，自修這樣子。
11597	298	8	92	en-US	So you mean that despite you didn’t finish the course, you still want to improve your language competence, so you continue to write this text?

11603	298	8	98	en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why she answers your texts in the middle of the night? Doesn’t it exceed the relationship of being a coworker?
11604	298	8	99	zh-TW	就是為什麼我會說他是個非常好的朋友，因為他是利用他自己的時間在教我中文。

11606	298	8	101	zh-TW	是的，我還在那邊工作。

Now the situation is that, because your degree program have already finished in May, 2017, so it cannot be the evidence or explanation for your relationship with your coworker.

Therefore, do you have any other evidence that you can prove that you and your coworker are only the relationship of college or friend to clarify that. Do you have any other evidence to clarify that?
11614	298	8	109	zh-TW	我目前想步道法院可以幫我調查的證據，就像我所說的，我跟我同事之間的關係非常的單純，我們倆之間的訊息就只是為了要增進我的語言能力以及我的中文能力而已。

11652	303	8	41	en-US	When we first met, he taught Portuguese. And after we got married, he continued teaching Portuguese. However, you know that Portuguese in Taiwan is not a popular language, and it’s not common, so the teaching hours is not stable, and sometimes will even have a period between jobs. And sometimes, the period between jobs could last for one to two months. And because my husband wants to have a stable income, so he wanted to …tended to teach English. And however, his mother tongue is not English, so he sought an advanced degree and want to polish his English.
11653	303	8	42	en-US	You just mentioned your husband wanted to polish his English, and does it mean that he wanted to seek an advanced degree in Taiwan?
11654	303	8	43	en-US	No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he wanted to seek an advanced degree which is about TESOL. So my husband have a distance learning program, which is provided by… which is taught from California, America, and had a distance learning program. And he only has to learn on distance learning and do not have to come to America.

11657	303	8	46	en-US	How did you know they have affairs and beyond co-worker’s relationship?
11658	303	8	47	en-US	at first, I noticed the strange thing it is because my husband started to work overtime in school and I just wonder my husband just go to learn English and want to seek an advanced degree, and why do you have to work overtime? And he said it is because he had a Chinese teacher, and he had to partner with her, so he has to work in school and communicate with her, so they can learn better. In the beginning, I didn’t suspect he would do the adultery. I started to think strange and it was because after he came back from school, he started to have many different calls, and the more important is that he wouldn’t talk in front of me. Instead, he would go to the study and talked. And because I think it’s strange, so I checked her cellphone and found many messages.
11659	303	8	48	en-US	so, did you find any unusual messages in his cellphone?
11660	303	8	49	en-US	In my husband’s phone book, there is always the same phone number, so I found it stranger and I checked his message. I found he always has messages with the same woman every day.
11661	303	8	50	en-US	And even though he always has text message with the same woman, does it… why would you think it’s strange? It seems fine. Or did you see any strange message in her cellphone? 
11662	303	8	51	en-US	If the message is just some common words, and I won’t find something strange, and will prosecute adultery case. and it is because the message is very intimate, and just before today’s proceeding, I had provided some of the messages to the judge, and I think all the contents are in the file.
11663	303	8	52	en-US	Exhibit evidence1 and page 13: here is the message content that your wife provided to the court, and the defendant you can check whether the message content is true.

11666	303	8	55	zh-TW	那是我一個同事傳給我的訊息，那當時我放了兩天假，因為我的同事很擔心，所以他傳了這封訊息給我。我的同事是在美國長大的，所以她是非常心胸寬大的，他講話一直都是這麼直接這樣子如此，那我們兩個在稱呼彼此親近的人的時候，會直接稱我的寶貝、我的愛。我們一直都是用這樣的說詞，所以我並不覺得有任何的不妥。
11667	303	8	56	en-US	so what you mean is that the people who sent the message…because she has stayed in the foreign countries for several years, so her thought is westernized, and she is kind of open-minded. So even she said my love to you don’t have any other special meanings? 
11668	303	8	57	zh-TW	哦對啊，這並沒有任何的意義，這只是我們對於親近的朋友，關心的說詞而已，表達我們是好朋友、彼此關心的意思。
11669	303	8	58	en-US	So what about the previous message she just sent to you? I really missed you, this sentence.
11670	303	8	59	zh-TW	正如同我剛剛所說過的，那是因為她擔心我，我們彼此是夥伴關係，那當時我請了兩天假，她自然而來會關心我，所以才發了這則訊息給我、表達他的關心。
11671	303	8	60	en-US	Well, so you mean that it is just because you had two days off, and do not go to work, and because she is your partner in the distance learning program, without you she has no assistance, so she sent this message to you, it’s that right?
11672	303	8	61	zh-TW	是的，所以這個訊息就是這樣子來的，這並沒有什麼了不起、很特別或是很奇怪的事情。
11673	303	8	62	en-US	Let’s move to the exhibit evidence two. The message happened at 11:55pm, on December 29th on 2017.

11674	303	8	63	zh-TW	當時她是想學著如何用中文來表達意思，所以她傳了這封訊息給我？
11675	303	8	64	en-US	so you mean that she, your colleague, sent this message to you, and the purpose is to help you do the homework. So what does it mean, I don’t really know…I don’t really get you.
11676	303	8	65	zh-TW	當我老婆有起訴我們通姦這件事的時候，我正在修遠距課程，並想要得到碩士學位，在這個課程當中，我需要修30學分。那自然地，為了完成這30個學分，我必須完成一些作業跟練習，那我的夥伴就協助我完成這些作業。
11677	303	8	66	en-US	I want to ask…so what do you really study in your master program? I don’t understand, can you explain to me?
11678	303	8	67	zh-TW	我的碩士學位是關於英語教學。那裡面就有關於英語教學、以及文化相關以及語言能力的培訓。
11679	303	8	68	en-US	So what you mean is that the TESOL that you studied in your master program, and in the master program, it contains some of courses about culture and communication, is that right?
11680	303	8	69	zh-TW	是的，然後我記得在這個碩士學位當中，有三堂課是關於文化以及溝通的課程。
11681	303	8	70	en-US	So the courses about culture and communication, what’s the common assignment that the teacher will assign you? 
11682	303	8	71	zh-TW	在這些文化課程當中，每個人的作業都會依照每個人在讀這個碩士學位的目的而有改變。那像我呢，我在讀這個碩士學位，是想要得到之後能在台灣教英文，因此我必須要展現我對中文有優秀的掌握能力。也是因為這樣，所以我的作業很多都是關於中文跟英文句子的翻譯。
11683	303	8	72	en-US	So you mean that because you plan to teach English in Taiwan, and you have to show that you has a good command of Chinese, so in order to complete your assignment, you have to translate the English sentence into Chinese, is that right?
11684	303	8	73	zh-TW	是的，此外我還需要去磨練我的口說以及寫作能力。
11685	303	8	74	en-US	So, let’s move back to the exhibit evidence two, the message. Do you mean that this message is one of your assignments?
11686	303	8	75	zh-TW	是的，這就是我當時的作業，我記得當初我看到這句話中文的時候，其實我並不了解它的意思，畢竟中文很多用字對外國人來說是很難了解的，因為我不懂，所以我去找我的partner幫忙，請他幫忙把這句話翻成英文，再把答案傳給我。
11687	303	8	76	en-US	Well, so that sentence, I want to by your side, kind of this sentence, is the situation just you wanted her to translate the Chinese sentence, and at that time, you asked her to send the correct answer to you. So it’s the total situation at that time?
11688	303	8	77	zh-TW	是的，那句話就只是我作業的解答而已。
11689	303	8	78	en-US	The defendant, let’s move to the exhibit evidence one, page 14 to16. Please… so now you can browse all the messages in this evidence, so you mean that all the messages are part of your assignments?

11691	303	8	80	en-US	and your wife just said that you and your colleague have the adultery, and what do you want to explain?
11692	303	8	81	zh-TW	關於外遇這件事，我覺得一直以來都是我老婆想太多。我知道我在這個家庭中，我其實沒辦法支撐家庭的很多重擔，不過在這個課程當中，我的太太就也沒有…從我的課程開始到現在，我的妻子也沒有給我任何的協助。在我上碩士課程當中，我太太一直都不願意來協助我完成任何作業，要不是他這樣子不支持我，我也不需要請求我的中文夥伴來協助我，所以我覺得現在發生的一切，都不能怪到我頭上。
11693	303	8	82	en-US	According to your statement, it seems that you and your wife have something unhappy and do not get along well with your wife.
11694	303	8	83	zh-TW	在我們剛結婚的時候，我們確實過得很幸福、也很開心，但是呢後來的問題就開始出現了，因為我在台灣教的是葡萄牙文，那工作的時數不穩定，也沒辦法帶來穩定的收入，所以我們就開始出現了狀況。在此之後，我們針對就業工作這件事情，我們時不時的在爭吵同件事，她並不相信我的努力跟堅持，我也不知道如何讓他了解我所面對的挫折跟困難之處。
11695	303	8	84	en-US	Well, let’s move back to your master program. Until now, do you still study in the master program? And when will you get the degree?
11696	303	8	85	zh-TW	我是在2016年四月開始讀這個碩士學位，那照理來說這個課程需要兩年，那原則上我應該在2017年五月完成。因為我一直沒有穩定的工作，所以沒有足夠時間唸書，所以我後來就放棄這個學位。正如我剛剛所說的，在我讀碩士學位的過程中，我的太太完全沒有支持我，我在讀書過程完全都是靠我自己，過程中我覺得很疲累、很挫折，我不知道該怎麼辦。
11697	303	8	86	en-US	you just mentioned the degree program… the period is two years, and you don’t complete the program, and I want to know the reason that you failed the program.
11698	303	8	87	zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有在課程上要求的作業，還有其中一些課程的要求。

However, you still had text messages with your colleague after the course ends, and the period is for seven months, and what’s your explanation?
11702	303	8	91	zh-TW	雖然我沒辦法完成我的碩士學位，但不代表我不想要改善我的中文能力，因此在我結束這個課程之後，我就靠自己想要改善我的中摁能力。
11703	303	8	92	en-US	So you mean even though you didn’t finish the master program, you still wants to improve your Chinese, and wants your Chinese become influent, is that right?
11704	303	8	93	zh-TW	是的，這就是為什麼我找我的女同事幫忙我。
11705	303	8	94	en-US	so, … your colleague kind of plays the role of your tutor?
11706	303	8	95	zh-TW	對我來說，她所扮演的角色並不單單只是家教，更是我的好朋友
11707	303	8	96	en-US	And did you pay money to your colleague for her teaching?
11708	303	8	97	zh-TW	沒有，我有說想付她錢，可是她沒有接受
11709	303	8	98	en-US	If she is not your tutor, and you do not pay her money, why did she work so hard, and at midnight, is the time that she go to bed, she still sent the messages to you. And the content of the message seems to beyond the co-worker’s relationship.
11710	303	8	99	zh-TW	這就是我為什麼說她真的是我很好的朋友，他都會在空閑時間幫助我，協助我精進中文能力
11711	303	8	100	en-US	Did you still teach English in the school?

11718	303	8	107	en-US	I heard the cram school they worked in,… I heard that the cram school just took some action, and they intended to persuade the colleague Huang Rong Er to quit the job. So I want to confirm with the cram school and clarify the situation.
11719	303	8	108	en-US	The defendant, do you want the court to investigate for you any further evidence? The current situation is that you have finished your master program in May, 2017. There is no reason that you make up reasons for finishing the assignments and sent messages with your colleague Huang Rong Er. And especially the time you two sent messages is almost after 9pm, it’s very possible for people to think there is a strange relationship between you and do you have any evidence that can help you clarify all the situation in this case?
11720	303	8	109	zh-TW	我實在想不到任何可以就我的立場幫我調查的事情。就如同我剛才所說，我們傳訊息這件事情非常簡單，只是單純我想要增進我的中文能力，然後我想要把中文學習的更好。

There are not many students waiting to learn Portuguese. So, his teaching hours is not that stable. Sometimes he wouldn’t have any classes for 1 or 2 months. After a while, he hoped that he could have a stable income. So he would like to teach English. However, English is not her native language. So he decides to go on further education and seeks for an advanced degree.
11971	320	8	42	en-US	You just mentioned he would like to seek for an advanced degree. Do you mean that he would like to study a degree in Taiwan?

12094	326	8	59	zh-TW	就像我說的，她是來….她是傳簡訊來問我東西。我那天請兩天假，所以她有點想念我

12100	326	8	65	zh-TW	就像我之前跟法庭所說的，我現在有那個碩士學位要修，而且有30學分去完成這個學位。正常來說，我有功課，我一定有功課要做，所以這就是我當時我要所提問的問題
12101	326	8	66	en-US	Can you further explain, what are you studying in your Master program?

12106	326	8	71	zh-TW	文化溝通不只是就是增加我的經驗之外，還有爭取教學的工作在台灣，除了當一個老師要有一個目標之外，還要一個有語言能力在中文上。所以我的作業有很多是有關中英上的翻譯。
12107	326	8	72	en-US	So you mean that you want to…you plan to teach English in Taiwan, but you have to get a master degree, and there are courses about Chinese. So the assignments you are assigned are translating the sentences right? In Chinese and English right?

12110	326	8	75	zh-TW	對的。那的確是我的，我之前在學中文所翻譯到的句子。你知道吧，對外國人來說，有些中文句子的確很難分辨。那剛好那個句子我就請我同事翻成中文給我看….請她翻成英文給我看。然後再請她傳送我過來。
12111	326	8	76	en-US	So you mean that ask your colleague to send the message into English to you. And those sentences of messages in English was just your assignments?

12116	326	8	81	zh-TW	我覺得太太真的有點對此太焦慮了。我知道她其實並沒有對我感到對我照顧這個家庭感到很滿意，從我一開始要唸碩士學位的時候，她就沒有支持我。如果在她一開始支持我的攻讀進修的話，我就不需要尋求我同事的幫忙了。所以她應該要為這一整件的誤會付起最大的責任吧。
12117	326	8	82	en-US	According to your words, there seem to be some dis….between your both?
12118	326	8	83	zh-TW	一開始我跟我太太結婚其實相處蠻愉快的，但問題出現在我要開始找工作，因為我當時要教葡萄牙文，但是我並沒有辦法拿到任何授課時數。所以因為這樣子我已經跟我太太吵了很多次了。她就是不相信我在這教學上做的努力，她也不知道我其實在教學上面臨了許多的挫折。
12119	326	8	84	en-US	Okay, let’s go back to your master course. Are you finish with your courses, or still keep going?
12120	326	8	85	zh-TW	我從2015年的秋天開始進行我兩年制的課程。原計畫是訂定在 2017年五月完成我碩士學位。但是因為我的打工因素，還有我作業沒有辦法完成。所以我就沒有拿到碩士學位。就像我說的，我太太並沒有支持我，我感覺像我自己一個人在追求這個學位，我真的感到很累也感到非常的挫折。
12121	326	8	86	en-US	You mean that the courses was for two-year program, but you didn’t finish. Why?
12122	326	8	87	zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成所有課程的功課。那還有一些課程的必修我也沒有辦法完成。

12130	326	8	95	zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，也是我真心地朋友
12131	326	8	96	en-US	Did you pay for her?
12132	326	8	97	zh-TW	沒有耶，我本來想要付錢給她但她拒絕了。
12133	326	8	98	en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why did she texting you during the midnight, and it’s not the right time, isn’t that beyond the co-worker’s relationship?
12134	326	8	99	zh-TW	所以我才說她真的是我的好朋友。她都利用她所有的花時間來幫助我學中文。
12135	326	8	100	en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school？
12136	326	8	101	zh-TW	是的，我還在那裡工作。

However, the action between you and your colleague is beyond co-worker’s relationship. And it’s weird that to text the messages after 9:00 p.m. just for asking for the….having with the assignments, do you have any evidence to…for the court to investigate? And verify your suspicion?
12144	326	8	109	zh-TW	基本上，我沒有要法院再進一步調查的證據了。我跟我同事真的就是單純之間的朋友互動。我就只是想要增進我的中文而已。

Now he is still teaching.Because not many people really want to learn Portuguese in Taiwan, his teaching hours are not stable. There is even a period of one to two months between jobs.To have a more stable income, he wants to teach English but he… his mother tongue is not English so he decided to seek advanced degree.

12190	332	8	49	en-US	He often called the same person and he sent messengers with the same one almost every single day.

12192	332	8	51	en-US	I am fine with the normal messages but the contents are too intimate and I have given some of the messages to the court. I think the messages are attached to the file.

12196	332	8	55	zh-TW	這是我同事發給的，因為那時候我休假兩天，她有點擔心，所有才有這個簡訊。我的同事在美國念書，她講話比較開放，那就是她表達方式，至於my love，那就是我們稱呼我們在乎的人的方式。
12197	332	8	56	en-US	You mean that because the person who sent you the message is educated in a foreign county, she is more open-minded. So “my love” doesn’t mean anything. Right?
12198	332	8	57	zh-TW	對阿，這就是一個很普通的稱呼方式。好朋友之間就這樣。
12199	332	8	58	en-US	what about the previous message?
12200	332	8	59	zh-TW	我說了，那就是她關心我的話而已。我們是工作上的搭檔，所以她關心我也很正常。

12203	332	8	62	en-US	The second message was sent at 11:55pm on Dec 29th, 2017. It’s from the same person. The content is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does it mean?
12204	332	8	63	zh-TW	她寫這樣的簡訊告訴我怎麼樣用中文表達一件事情，那是我的功課。
12205	332	8	64	en-US	She sent you this message to help you with the assignment? What does that mean?
12206	332	8	65	zh-TW	就像我太太所述，我有在進修，我需要修滿30個學生，所以我需要做點功課和練習也是很正常的。
12207	332	8	66	en-US	Could you explain on you master degree? What’s it about?
12208	332	8	67	zh-TW	我的課程是關於TESOL 英文教學，它除了包含教學課程以外還有包含一些文化還有本身語言能力。

12211	332	8	70	en-US	For these courses of cultural communication, they gave you what kind of assignments?
12212	332	8	71	zh-TW	這些文化溝通課程給的功課，會因為不同的人而不一樣。就我來說，我在台灣，我想要一個教英文的教職，那我就必須要證明我的中文能力很好。所以我有很多功課是關於中英的翻譯。
12213	332	8	72	en-US	Because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove your Chinese competence. That’s why the course give you the Chinese translation assignments?
12214	332	8	73	zh-TW	對，當然我也有被…也有被訓練一些寫作和口說方面的能力。
12215	332	8	74	en-US	So, the messages are your assignments?
12216	332	8	75	zh-TW	對，那就是我的作業，你知道中文句子很多時候對外國人很難，我就請我的同事把句子翻譯成英文，然後再用簡訊傳給我。
12217	332	8	76	en-US	So you asked your colleague about the Chinese sentence and she translated it into English and sent it to you. This is the situation at that time? That is only the sentence of the assignment?
12218	332	8	77	zh-TW	那句話只是我作業的答案而已。
12219	332	8	78	en-US	Exhibition 1, page 14 to 16. Please check the messages. Are these messages only for the assignments? They are only the answers to the assignments?
12220	332	8	79	zh-TW	對，這些簡訊都是我的功課而已。
12221	332	8	80	en-US	So about your wife mentioning you have an affair with your coworker, what’s your explanation?
12222	332	8	81	zh-TW	我覺得我的太太真的想太多了，我知道她一直嫌我不夠專注在家庭。我想要庭上知道，她打從一開始就沒有支持我，關於我對碩士學位的進修。如果她當初有在我進修的時候幫忙我，那我也不需要問我的同事，我覺得她要對她的誤解負責。
12223	332	8	82	en-US	According to your statement, I think there are some unpleasant moments between you and your wife?
12224	332	8	83	zh-TW	我們一開始結婚的時候是很快樂，但問題是我的工作，我教葡萄牙文，授課時數不穩定。所以工作成了我們爭吵的重點，我們常為這個在吵，她不相信我已經很盡力了，我也無法讓她知道我多沮喪。
12225	332	8	84	en-US	Let’s come back to the Master program. When did this program start? Do you get the degree?
12226	332	8	85	zh-TW	我從2015年秋天開始修這個碩士學位，我預計在2017年五月修完，但是我沒有拿到這個學位，因為我有一些兼職，我沒有時間去做作業。就像我剛剛說的，我的太太從來沒有幫忙過我，我一直都是一個人在做這件事情，我真的很累也很沮喪。
12227	332	8	86	en-US	You said that this master program is a two-year course but you did not finish, why?
12228	332	8	87	zh-TW	我沒辦法完成課程的所有作業還有一些課程要求。

12233	332	8	92	en-US	So you mean that even though you did not finish the Master program, you still want to learn Chinese ad sharpen your Chinese ability, right?
12234	332	8	93	zh-TW	對，這就是為甚麼我請我的同事幫忙?
12235	332	8	94	en-US	So the role of your colleague, she is like your tutor?

12237	332	8	96	en-US	Did you pay her?
12238	332	8	97	zh-TW	沒有，我原本想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
12239	332	8	98	en-US	If you did not pay her, why she still send you the message during bed time? Is it beyond coworkers’ relationship?
12240	332	8	99	zh-TW	我說過她是一個很支持的朋友，她用她自己的時間來幫我。
12241	332	8	100	en-US	Do you still teach in that cram school?
12242	332	8	101	zh-TW	對，我還在那工作。
12243	332	8	102	en-US	Does the colleague still work there too?
12244	332	8	103	zh-TW	她還在那工作，但我們不再是搭檔了。

Sha prosecuted her husband, Edward Takayashi, for getting too close with his coworker, 蓉兒-Huang, in the school where Takayashi works. Yu-han Wang found many pieces of intimate message in the defendant’s cellphone.

12285	342	8	38	en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or abroad?
12286	342	8	39	en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. At that time, my husband came to Taiwan and wanted to teach Portuguese here
12287	342	8	40	en-US	In the past few years, is his job teaching Portuguese?
12288	342	8	41	en-US	He was a Portuguese teacher when we get married, and he kept teaching Portuguese after we married. There are not many people in Taiwan that want to learn Portuguese. As a result, he has an unstable teaching hours and often has a period between jobs for about one or two months. Since he wanted to have more fixed income, he decided to start to teach English. Since his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.
12289	342	8	42	en-US	You just said he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean he wanted to earn a degree in Taiwan?
12290	342	8	43	en-US	No. Since he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he needed to get a degree of TESOL. He found a distance learning program established in California, USA.

12293	342	8	46	en-US	How do you know they have an affair?
12294	342	8	47	en-US	In the beginning, I found my husband often stay in the school, working over time. I ask him why he had to work overtime just working in cram school. And my husband said he partnered with another Chinese teacher, so they need a lot of communications about the class. First, I didn’t doubt him at all. However, later I found that my husband often receives several calls after work. When he received the call, he didn’t speak in front of me. Instead, he went to his study room. So I decided to check his phone.
12295	342	8	48	en-US	Did you find any unusual in the defendant’s cellphone?
12296	342	8	49	en-US	First, I checked his record, and found there is always a same number. Then I checked his mail. I found that he nearly every day contact a woman by mail.
12297	342	8	50	en-US	That’s not so unusual sending a mail. Or is there anything strange?
12298	342	8	51	en-US	If they are just ordinary messages, then I won’t care about them. But the woman sends some intimate words or sentences to my husband. He’s a married man! I have provided some contents to the court. I believe it’s in the file.

12302	342	8	55	zh-TW	這個嘛，她是我的同事。那時候我休了兩天的假，她非常擔心我，所以傳訊息問我發生什麼事。我同事是在美國受的教育，所以她心胸很開放，她講話一直都是這樣子的，至於”my love”，這是我們在叫自己在乎的人、關心的人的方式。
12303	342	8	56	en-US	You mean your colleague is educated in the US, so her thought was westernized, so the way she talks are more open, and “my love” doesn’t mean anything. Is that correct?
12304	342	8	57	zh-TW	沒錯。這就只是很好的朋友，互相關心的朋友之間會講的話而已。
12305	342	8	58	en-US	What does the first sentence mean? “I really miss you.”
12306	342	8	59	zh-TW	就像我說的，我們是同事，我們是工作搭檔。我請了兩天假，她當然會非常擔心我。
12307	342	8	60	en-US	Do you mean just because you take two days off, she sent this kind of message to you to tell you without your assistance in the class, she really miss you?

12309	342	8	62	en-US	The second message. The time was 11:55 p.m., on 29th December, 2017, from the same number. The content was, “I want you by my side, when can we truly get together?” Why do you have this kind of message?
12310	342	8	63	zh-TW	她是在教我要怎麼，她是在教我作業，她在教我這句話該怎麼用中文表達。
12311	342	8	64	en-US	She sends this message to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?
12312	342	8	65	zh-TW	就像我妻子剛剛提到的，我正在攻讀碩士學位，我必須要修滿30個學分才能拿到學位，所以，我自然需要做一些作業。
12313	342	8	66	en-US	Could you explain what on earth are you learning in your Master degree program?

12318	342	8	71	zh-TW	這些文化溝通課程的作業，會針對每一個學生而有不同，像是我的話，我想要在台灣找到一個教英文的工作，所以為了達到這個目標，並加強我的語言能力，我必須顯示我有很好的中文能力。所以我的作業有很多需要翻譯中文句子。
12319	342	8	72	en-US	You mean since you want to teach English in Taiwan so you need to show that you have good Chinese competence. And so you will have the assignments like translation, right?
12320	342	8	73	zh-TW	是的，除此之外我還需要增強我的口說跟寫作的能力。
12321	342	8	74	en-US	Let’s come back to this question. Is this your assignment? The message in your phone?
12322	342	8	75	zh-TW	是的，我記得我的這個作業，我需要將這個句子翻成英文，但是你也知道，有些中文字對我們來說，是很難詮釋、很難了解的，所以我請我的同事翻譯這個句子，並將答案寄給我。
12323	342	8	76	en-US	You ask your colleague how to translate this sentence to English, so your colleague type this sentence in English and send to you. This message is just the answer of your assignment, correct?
12324	342	8	77	zh-TW	那封簡訊就只是我作業的解答而已。
12325	342	8	78	en-US	Page 14 to 16 in file 1. That’s all message contents in your cellphone. Are they all your answers of your assignment?

12327	342	8	80	en-US	Your wife accuse that you have an affair with your colleague. What’s your explanation?
12328	342	8	81	zh-TW	我妻子真的想太多了，我知道她一直對我沒辦法穩定地養家這件事情很不滿意，她從我一開始修習這段課程開始，就沒有對我任何的支持。她完全不想協助我得到這個學位，如果她能多支持我一點，我就不用為了完成作業，向我的同事求助，所以她該為這整件事情負責。
12329	342	8	82	en-US	According to your statement, it seems that you two are not getting along with each other, right?
12330	342	8	83	zh-TW	剛結婚的時候，我們相處得很不錯，但是我的工作一直是個問題，我想要在這裡教葡萄牙語維生，但是我的授課時數一直都不穩定，我的工作問題一直成為我們吵架的話題，我的妻子不相信我已經盡力了，而我也沒有辦法讓她了解我所面對的挫折以及困境。
12331	342	8	84	en-US	Alright. Let’s go back to your Master degree. When di
12332	342	8	85	zh-TW	我在2015年秋天開始課程，這是一個兩年的課程，所以我原本應該在2017年的5月就可以修習完畢，可是我在這期間也一直有在做兼職的工作，沒有時間完成我的作業，所以我還沒有得到學位。像我剛剛說的，我的妻子完全沒有給我任何支持，讓我覺得我是很孤獨地在攻讀這個學位，我非常的疲憊和挫折。
12333	342	8	86	en-US	You said this is a two-year program, and you didn’t finish it. Why is that?

12338	342	8	91	zh-TW	即使我的課程已經結束，可是我還想要繼續增進我的語言能力，所以課程結束之後，我還是想要自學。
12339	342	8	92	en-US	You mean even if you didn’t get a Master’s degree, you still want to keep learning Chinese and want to speak fluent Chinese, right?
12340	342	8	93	zh-TW	對，所以我才繼續找我的同事求助。
12341	342	8	94	en-US	So this colleague is playing a role of your tutor, correct?
12342	342	8	95	zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，也是一位真心的朋友。
12343	342	8	96	en-US	Did you pay her?
12344	342	8	97	zh-TW	沒有，我想付費給她的，但是她拒絕了。
12345	342	8	98	en-US	If you didn’t pay for her, why she sends message to you at the time when she should go to bed. It’s not the thing just a coworker would do.
12346	342	8	99	zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個非常支持我的朋友，她願意犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學中文。
12347	342	8	100	en-US	Do you still work in this cram school?
12348	342	8	101	zh-TW	是，我還在那裡工作。

12351	342	8	104	en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any evidence that want to investigate further or other witness you want to subpoena?
12352	342	8	105	en-US	I hope to subpoena this colleague, 黃蓉兒, in 美而美cram school as a witness and ask her about the relationship between she and the defendant and the context and purpose of those messages.
12353	342	8	106	en-US	Accuser, do you have any evidence that need the court to investigate further?
12354	342	8	107	en-US	I heard that 美而美cram school has taken some actions based on their relationship and even pursue 蓉兒-Huang to quit her job. I want to verify if this is true.
12355	342	8	108	en-US	Defendant, do you have any evidence that you need the court to investigate for you? According to the situation now, you have already finished your program in May, 2017. You have no reason to send messages with your colleague by the excuse of doing assignment. Furthermore, you send messages to each other after 9 p.m. You need more evidence to help you with this case.
12356	342	8	109	zh-TW	我想不到其他能請法庭代表我調查的證據，我和我同事之間的對話真的很單純，我只是想要增進我的語言能力，想要把中文學得更好。

12436	348	8	83	zh-TW	恩在我們的婚姻一開始我們確實相處得很好, 而且有很多甜蜜的時光, 但是在這之後, 她對我的就業狀況感到不滿, 我一開始是教葡萄牙文, 但是我的工作時數不穩定, 然後這個就變成我們爭執的原因, 她不相信我曾經為了這件事情努力過而且掙扎過, 然後個就變成我們之間的問題並且會常常為了這事情而爭吵不休

12498	354	8	39	en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
12499	354	8	40	en-US	So…Does your husband teach Portuguese for the past several years? Or is there any other language he taught?
12500	354	8	41	en-US	He has taught Portuguese for the four past years, and after we got married, he still taught Portuguese. Because Portuguese isn’t an popular language in Taiwan, so he doesn’t have many teaching hours, and he doesn’t have a steady income. So maybe sometimes he will have up to one or two months period between jobs. So to have a steady income, he wants to teach English. But English isn’t his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.
12501	354	8	42	en-US	You just mentioned that he wants to seek an advanced degree, do you mean that he’s looking for a degree in Taiwan?
12502	354	8	43	en-US	No, I mean that because he wants to teach English, he has to have a degree of TESOL. He found a course on the Internet, and the course is from California, America, and the course provide distant learning program which is distance learning, so he doesn’t have to go to the US and he can enjoy the courses. So after he finished his distance learning program, he can gain a master degree, so he planned to get TESOL and to gain a license to teach English in Taiwan.
12503	354	8	44	en-US	So what’s the relationship between he and his adultery partner?
12504	354	8	45	en-US	In the courses, there is an English teacher and a Chinese teacher, and they are colleague relationship. That girl is his Chinese teacher in his company. And they are partner relationship.
12505	354	8	46	en-US	How do you that your husband has an affair with his colleague?
12506	354	8	47	en-US	At the beginning, I only found that he often worked late in the cram school, but after that, I started to think that it is only a cram school, why do you have to work this late? But he explained that because he is an English teacher, he has a lot to communicate with the Chinese teacher so he have to stay in the cram school to communicate with his colleague. At first, I didn’t suspect him. But after I found that when he got home, he often got some phone calls, and he doesn’t want to pick up the phone in front of me. Instead, he went to his study room to talk in the phone. I wonder why he did this, so later I checked his phone.
12507	354	8	48	en-US	Did you find anything unusual in his cell phone
12508	354	8	49	en-US	So later I went to check his dial record, and I found that there’s always a same number on his phone, so later I went to check his phone message, and I found that every night he messaged the same woman…every night.
12509	354	8	50	en-US	It is not that serious if he sent a message to a woman? Or you found some inappropriate message in his cell phone?
12510	354	8	51	en-US	If it is only some ordinary messages, it’s ok for me. But he’s married, how can he let a woman send some intimate message to him? Before, I have sent some message to court, they are in the file.

12514	354	8	55	zh-TW	這個是我的一個同事傳給我的。那個時候，我請了兩天的假，他非常擔心我，所以他才傳了這封訊息給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，所以他的思想非常開放，他講這些話都很正常，而我很想你，這些都是因為他關心我所以才會說的話，我們都是這樣溝通的。至於My love，我的愛，那只是因為我們很熟，所以我們都這樣稱呼對方。
12515	354	8	56	en-US	So you mean that because your colleague is educated in the foreign country, so she is westernized, so the message “my love” is because she is open-minded and it doesn’t mean anything, is that right?
12516	354	8	57	zh-TW	沒有啊，那沒有什麼意思，那就只是很好很好的朋友之間會互相稱呼的一個名字而已，或者是非常關心對方的朋友也會這樣講。
12517	354	8	58	en-US	Then what’s the previous sentence in this message?
12518	354	8	59	zh-TW	就像我講的一樣，我們兩個是非常好的朋友，而之前我請兩天假的時候，他非常的擔心我，所以他才傳了那些訊息給我。
12519	354	8	60	en-US	So do you mean that because you took two days off, so she didn’t have your help when she is having a class so she missed you a lot, is that your meaning?
12520	354	8	61	zh-TW	對啊，那就是簡訊的內容，我覺得沒有什麼大不了的。
12521	354	8	62	en-US	So the second message is sent on eleven fifty-five pm, on twenty nine December 2017, from the same cell phone to your cell phone, and the context is “I want you to by my side, when can we be together?” 我想要你待在我的身邊，什麼時候我們才能在一起呢? Why does the message have this context? And what’s your explanation? Why do you have this message?
12522	354	8	63	zh-TW	當初他傳這封簡訊只是想要教我一句我不會的中文，然後他只是要教我這句話要怎麼講。
12523	354	8	64	en-US	So you mean that your colleague sent this message to you is to help you to learn Chinese, what does that mean? What do you mean she helped you to do your homework?
12524	354	8	65	zh-TW	就像我太太之前有提到的，我現在正在進行一個碩士課程，所以我必須要完成三十個學分才能拿到這個學位，那當然我要完成這個學位我必須完成一些作業還有練習，這就是為什麼。
12525	354	8	66	en-US	Could you please first explain what do you learn in your master degree?
12526	354	8	67	zh-TW	我的碩士學位是關於英語教學的。然後這個計畫是教你怎麼去教英文還有一些文化上的問題，所以這其中也包含了語言能力。
12527	354	8	68	en-US	So you mean that you’re having TESOL classes in your master degree, and it includes some cultural communication, is that right?
12528	354	8	69	zh-TW	沒錯，我記得至少有三門課都是有關文化，還有語言溝通的。
12529	354	8	70	en-US	So the so-called cultural communication classes, what assignment you have to accomplish in this course?
12530	354	8	71	zh-TW	我的們文化還有溝通作業是因人而異的，每個學生都不一樣，就像拿我自己來說好了，因為我在台灣想要尋找一個英語教學的職位，所以我必須要證明我自己的語言能力，我必須證明我的中文能力是好的。所以我有很多作業都是中英文翻譯。
12531	354	8	72	en-US	So do you mean that you want to teach English in Taiwan, so currently you’re studying a master degree to cultivate your Chinese competence…ability? So you have to finish some assignments which is related to Chinese-English translation, is that right?
12532	354	8	73	zh-TW	是的，所以此外我還必須加強我的會話、口說還有寫作能力。
12533	354	8	74	en-US	Ok so let us be back to the sentence we just mentioned. So is it a part of your assignment?
12534	354	8	75	zh-TW	是的，我還記得這些句子。這些句子我必須要把它翻譯成中文，然後，這些中文我必須把它翻譯成英文，而且你知道有的時候這些中文的句子對於外國人來說是非常難理解的，所以我才尋求我的同事幫忙。拜託他幫我翻譯成英文然後拜託他把答案傳給我。
12535	354	8	76	en-US	So you mean that you typed a Chinese sentence to her and she sent back the answer which is an English sentence to you, is it the situation at that time? So you mean that it is only your assignment, is that right?
12536	354	8	77	zh-TW	那封簡訊就是我作業的答案而已，就這樣。
12537	354	8	78	en-US	Ok, let us take a look at the displayed evidence, page 14 to 16, these are all contexts of your messages. So in these pages, are the messages all your assignment which is the assignment you asked your colleague for help?
12538	354	8	79	zh-TW	沒錯啊，這些都是幫助我作業的答案。
12539	354	8	80	en-US	So according to your wife, your wife just said that you have an affair with your colleague, so what’s your explanation on that?
12540	354	8	81	zh-TW	我覺得我的太太真的是想太多了。我知道他一直不滿意我對家庭沒有什麼幫助，但在一開始在我學習中文的時候，他也一樣就是也沒有給我什麼支持。他後來完全不支持我完成這個學位，而且如果他有給我支持的話，我也不會找我的同事幫忙。所以我覺得他應該要對整件事情負責，他不應該誤會我，而且他也沒有給我支持。
12541	354	8	82	en-US	According to your statement, there’s something unhappy between you and your wife?
12542	354	8	83	zh-TW	在我們婚姻一開始的時候，我們也是有一些美好的時光的，但是問題就是在我的職業。我原本一開始是教葡萄牙文的，但是這並不能給我一個穩定的收入，我不能獲得足夠的教學時數。後來因為工作不穩定，成為了我們兩個常常吵架的原因，我們常常吵架，而我的太太不相信我有盡我最大的努力去找工作或學習英文，然後我也沒有辦法讓他理解我的挫折還有我面臨的困難。
12543	354	8	84	en-US	Well let’s get back to the issue of your master degree. When did you start your master degree? And did you finish it? Did you get the degree?
12544	354	8	85	zh-TW	我的碩士在2015年的秋季開始的，原本他應該是一個兩年的計畫，預計在2017年的五月結束，但我並沒有完成這個碩士課程，因為我一邊做我的打工，還要一邊上課，我沒有辦法兩邊兼顧。就像我之前說的，我在讀我的碩士學位的時候，我太太並沒有給我支持，我覺得在讀碩士的一路上我都是一個人，所以我開始覺得很累也覺得很挫折。
12545	354	8	86	en-US	So you just mentioned that it is a two-year program, but in the end you didn’t finish it. Why didn’t you finish it?
12546	354	8	87	zh-TW	因為我沒有辦法完成我課程所有作業。還有一些課程的要求我沒辦法達到。
12547	354	8	88	en-US	So when is your registration of your last semester? When did your register end of your last semester?
12548	354	8	89	zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期的期限是2017年的春季。
12549	354	8	90	en-US	So if what you said is true, then your course finished in May 2017, so it is reasonable to say that you won’t have any assignment if your courses are finished. But you and your colleague still have sent message to each other for seven months after your course is finished. 
12550	354	8	91	zh-TW	嗯…我的課程結束了不代表我就不想要精進我的中文，我還想精進我的中文，然後完成一些我自己的作業，所以我才傳那些訊息給我的同事去精進我的作文。
12551	354	8	92	en-US	So do you mean that you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that what you mean?

12605	360	8	40	en-US	Over the past years, is his job always teaching Portuguese?
12606	360	8	41	en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he is still teaching Portuguese. However, there are not many Taiwanese wanted to learn Portuguese, so his teaching hours is always unstable, there might be a period of one to two months between his jobs. After that, he wanted to have a stable income, so he decided to teach English. However, English is not his native language. Therefore, he is seeking an advanced degree for English.
12607	360	8	42	en-US	You mentioned that he was seeking an advanced degree. Does that mean that he is trying to earn a degree in Taiwan?
12608	360	8	43	en-US	No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he need a TESOL degree.

How come you have to overwork?” He told me that he has to collaborate with the Chinese teacher, so he has to stay in the cram school to discuss about their work. At first, I did not suspect him at all. However, he always received phone call, and he will not answer it in front of me. He will go to the study room to answer it, so I decided to check his phone.
12613	360	8	48	en-US	Did you find anything particular in his phone?
12614	360	8	49	en-US	In his phone book, there is always a same number calling to him. Out of curious, I check his text messages, and I realized they have a lot of text messages every day.

12620	360	8	55	zh-TW	他就只是我的同事而已，我記得我當時請假兩天，他很關心、擔心我，所以他才會傳簡訊來。我的同事是在美國受教的，所以他還蠻開放的。所以他才會那樣說，“my love” 就只是我們關心對方的方式。
12621	360	8	56	en-US	Do you mean that because the sender stays in a foreign country before, so it means that she is westernized, and when she said “my love” does not mean anything at all?
12622	360	8	57	zh-TW	是的，這段表達的方式只是我們在乎對方的方式。
12623	360	8	58	en-US	How about the phrase before that?

12629	360	8	64	en-US	You said that the other party send this message to help you with the assignment. What does that mean
12630	360	8	65	zh-TW	我老婆剛剛有提到我正在爭取我的碩士學位，我必須要拿到30學分才能取得學位，所以當然會有一些作業需要完成。
12631	360	8	66	en-US	Can you please first explain about your Master’s Degree?
12632	360	8	67	zh-TW	我的碩士學位主要是有關於英語教學。裡面的課程來講的話，主要就是如何教學英文，以及文化和語言能力相關的課程。
12633	360	8	68	en-US	So you mean that you are now pursuing TESOL degree, and there are some cross-cultural communication courses?

12635	360	8	70	en-US	What are the assignments for the cultural communication courses?
12636	360	8	71	zh-TW	這些文化溝通的課程，作業因人而異。以我自己為例，我現在在台灣教英文，我必須要有好的中文溝通能力。因此，我的作業當中有很多是和中英文翻譯相關。
12637	360	8	72	en-US	You mean that because you have planned to teach English in Taiwan , so you have to prove that you have a good command of Chinese, and you have to practice English-Chinese translation. Is that right?

12646	360	8	81	zh-TW	我太太想太多了，我知道我自己沒有賺很多錢去支撐這個家庭，但在我念碩士學位上，他並沒有給予太多的支持和幫助。我覺得他不願意幫我完成這份學位，如果他能夠多付出一點心力的話，我覺得我就不會去問我同事了，因此他的錯比較大。
12647	360	8	82	en-US	According to what you said, you do not get along with your wife, do you?
12648	360	8	83	zh-TW	一開始，我們的確過得很幸福，但是就業一直是個問題。我當時想要教學葡萄牙文，但是我的授課時數一直不穩定。在就業這個議題上一直是個問題，我們在這件事上爭論。他一直認為我並沒有盡力去找到一份好的工作，我也無法向他表達我垂頭喪氣的一面。
12649	360	8	84	en-US	Now let’s get back to the Master’s degree courses. When did your courses start and end? Have you earned your degree yet?
12650	360	8	85	zh-TW	我是在2015年的秋天開始上課，這是一個兩年的課程，所以預計會在2017年5月完成。但是因為我有兼職工作，並沒有足夠的時間完成作業，因此還沒有取得學位。就像我說的，我太太並沒有想要幫我的意思，我要自己完成這份學位，我感到疲倦、挫折。
12651	360	8	86	en-US	You mentioned that the course is a two-year program, but you did not finish it. Why is that?
12652	360	8	87	zh-TW	我無法完成所有的作業以及課程上所設立的標準。
12653	360	8	88	en-US	When is the last semester you have registered?

12655	360	8	90	en-US	If everything you stated was correct, your semester should end on May 2017, and you will not have any assignment anymore. Why do you still text your colleague 7 months after the semester?
12656	360	8	91	zh-TW	雖然我沒有完成學位，但並不代表我不想精進我的語文能力。因此我仍繼續和我的同事來往，希望能夠精進我的中文。
12657	360	8	92	en-US	You did not finish your degree, but you still want to practice your Chinese to become more fluently. Is that what you mean?
12658	360	8	93	zh-TW	是的，所以我才會請我同事幫忙。
12659	360	8	94	en-US	Is your colleague playing the role of a tutor?
12660	360	8	95	zh-TW	他不僅是我的家教，也是我的朋友。
12661	360	8	96	en-US	Did you pay her for tutoring?
12662	360	8	97	zh-TW	並沒有，我原本想要付錢，但他卻拒絕了。
12663	360	8	98	en-US	If you did not pay for her, why did she try to text you in the middle of the night after sleeping hours? The situation is beyond co-workers.
12664	360	8	99	zh-TW	所以我才說他是一個很支持我的朋友，他用他自己的時間幫助我。
12665	360	8	100	en-US	Are you still working in that cram school?
12666	360	8	101	zh-TW	是的，我還是在那裡工作。

12670	360	8	105	en-US	I hope to subpoena the colleague 黃蓉兒from 美而美cram school as a witness in order to explain her relationship with the defendant and the text messages she sent.
12671	360	8	106	en-US	Is there anything the accuser would like the court to investigate?
12672	360	8	107	en-US	I heard that the cram school has taken action to their relationship. The cram school has asked 黃蓉兒 to quit her job. I would like to ask whether the court could verify this matter.
12673	360	8	108	en-US	Did the defendant have anything you want the court to investigate on? The current situation is that your registration for the Master’s Degree has already finished on May 2017, so you should not use finishing assignment for explanation for the text message with黃蓉兒, especially with those messages were texted after 9 pm, so is there anything you want us to investigate on?
12674	360	8	109	zh-TW	我並沒有任何證據能夠證明這件事，但我們的關係真的非常單純，就是我想要學語言，增進我的中文能力。
12675	360	8	110	en-US	The next proceeding of this case will be on 4:30 pm June 24th 2017. We will move on to the cross-examination of the witness. Both the accuser and defendants could hire lawyers if necessary. Do both parties understand?

12726	366	8	55	zh-TW	那是我同事傳給我的，然後我記得那天我已經兩天沒去上班了，所以他才傳給我，關心我一下。我同事是在美國受教育的，所以她非常的開放，然後她之所以會叫我親愛的，那是她表現在乎的人的稱呼方式。
12727	366	8	56	en-US	So, do you mean that the person messages you was educated in United States, so her thought was open-minded and westernized. So, she calls you “my love,” it doesn’t mean anything, right?
12728	366	8	57	zh-TW	嗯對啊，那是我們對於親密的朋友會有的稱呼，並沒有什麼特別的意思。
12729	366	8	58	en-US	So, how about the previous sentences?
12730	366	8	59	zh-TW	就像我說的，我們是同事，然後她非常的關心我，我兩天都沒有去上班，所以她傳個簡訊關心我。
12731	366	8	60	en-US	Do you mean that you didn’t work for two days, so she didn’t have your assistance, so she really miss you, right?
12732	366	8	61	zh-TW	對，就像是簡訊上傳的一樣，這根本就沒有什麼大不了的啊。

12734	366	8	63	zh-TW	她傳這封簡訊是為了如何幫我用中文敘述我的中文作業。
12735	366	8	64	en-US	So, you mention that the other party sent the message for you for assisting you to do the Chinese homework. What’s that mean?
12736	366	8	65	zh-TW	 我老婆剛剛也有提到了，我因為想要找一個英文教師的工作，所以我參加了一個遠距教學的碩士課程，然後在課程裡，我必須完成30個學分，我才可以拿到學位，所以這個作業是在課程裡面所要求的。

12741	366	8	70	en-US	So, about the culture communication courses, what’s its homework?
12742	366	8	71	zh-TW	文化溝通課程的作業會是因人而異的，以我來舉例好了，因為我想要在台灣找一個英語教學的工作，所以呢，我的作業就必須對我的中文是很要求的。所以呢，我的作業當中有很多是中英文需要翻譯的東西。
12743	366	8	72	en-US	So, do you mean that because you wanted to teach English in Taiwan; however, there is a certain Chinese command for you. So, the assignments for culture communication ask you to translate some Chinese and English sentence, right?

12745	366	8	74	en-US	So, let’s back to the message. Is this message your assignment?
12746	366	8	75	zh-TW	對的，那是我的作業，然後那句句子必須中文翻成英文，你也知道的，外國人學習中文是很辛苦的，因為有些字我們真的認不出來，所以我就請我的同事幫忙，然後請她幫我翻譯成中文再傳送過來。
12747	366	8	76	en-US	So, do you mean that you ask for the translation of the Chinese sentence, and your colleague translates it in English? So, the message is just an answer for the assignment?
12748	366	8	77	zh-TW	是的，那個簡訊只是我功課的解答。
12749	366	8	78	en-US	Let’s show the evidence 1, page 14 to 16. Are all these messages just the answers for your assignment?

12752	366	8	81	zh-TW	我太太對於這件事真的是想太多了，而且我剛開始攻讀這個遠距教學課程的時候，她就沒有給予我任何支持，然後她還覺得我對這個家庭不用心。她完全不支持我攻讀這個課程，所以我有作業難題的時候也只好去找我的同事，她應該要為這整件誤會負責。
12753	366	8	82	en-US	So, according to your thought, is there anything unhappy between you and your wife?
12754	366	8	83	zh-TW	我們一開始是相處非常愉快的，但是呢，主要就是我工作的問題，因為我想要在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是這個教學時數是非常不固定的，所以我們就有一些爭吵。所以這就變成我們之間最大的問題，她不相信我真的已經盡力去找工作了，所以我們就常常為了這個事情爭吵，然後這讓我非常的挫折，然後我也不知道如何面對她。
12755	366	8	84	en-US	So, let’s go back to your master degree program. When did it begin, and is it over?
12756	366	8	85	zh-TW	我在2015年開始我的碩士課程的，預計在2017年會拿到學位，但因為我一直有在做兼職，最後學分有點拖延，所以沒有拿到這個學位。就像我所說的，我太太從來不支持我讀這個學位，然後這段期間我遇到學業上的瓶頸的時候也沒人可以支持我，這讓我覺得很累又很挫折。
12757	366	8	86	en-US	You mention that the master degree was a two-year degree, how did you fail to complete?
12758	366	8	87	zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有的學分，還有一些其他課程要求。
12759	366	8	88	en-US	When was your last semester of your registration?
12760	366	8	89	zh-TW	我最後註冊的學期是2017年的下學期。
12761	366	8	90	en-US	As you mention, the last semester registration was in spring in 2017. So, reasonably speaking, there was not any homework after that. However, you have messages with your co-worker after 7 months. Why do you do that?
12762	366	8	91	zh-TW	即使我沒有拿到那個學位，這不代表我就不想要精進我的語言能力，所以在那之後，我還是一直嘗試著想要精進我的中文能力，所以我就一直靠著自學的方式來進修。
12763	366	8	92	en-US	Do you mean that even though you didn’t complete that master degree, you still want to sharpen your Chinese language skill. So, you try your best to learn Chinese, right?
12764	366	8	93	zh-TW	是的，所以我找我的同事幫忙。
12765	366	8	94	en-US	 So, your co-worker is kind of your tutor?
12766	366	8	95	zh-TW	她不只是家教，而且還是我一個非常要好的朋友。
12767	366	8	96	en-US	Do you pay for her?
12768	366	8	97	zh-TW	沒有，我想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
12769	366	8	98	en-US	If you didn’t pay for her, why does she still message you in the midnight? Is this totally beyond co-worker’s relationship?
12770	366	8	99	zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說她是非常有義氣的朋友，然後她甚至不辭辛勞犧牲自己私人時間來幫我學習中文。
12771	366	8	100	en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?
12772	366	8	101	zh-TW	是的，我還在那邊工作。
12773	366	8	102	en-US	Is your colleague still in there?
12774	366	8	103	zh-TW	她還有在那邊工作，但我們沒有常常搭檔了。
12775	366	8	104	en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any evidence or witness and wanted to investigate or subpoena?
12776	366	8	105	en-US	I wanted to subpoena the co-worker of the defendant, Rong-Er Huang, as a witness. I hope she will be on court to explain the messages and the relationship with the defendant.
12777	366	8	106	en-US	The accuser, do you have any evidence and want the court to investigate for you?
12778	366	8	107	en-US	I heard about that Mei Er Mei Cram School tried to intervene this event, and they even tried to fire Rong-Er Huang. So, I hope the court ask Mei Er Mei Cram School to verify the situation.
12779	366	8	108	en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence and want the court to investigate for you? Your problem is that your master degree should be over in May in 2017, and you really didn’t have any reasons for messaging with your co-worker, Rong-Er Huang. And most importantly, you usually message each other after 9 P.M. every night, it’s really hard for us not to suspect you. So, do you have anything to help with your case?
12780	366	8	109	zh-TW	我沒有進一步的證據可以證明這件事，但是就像我所說的，我跟我同事之間的簡訊真的單純只是為了想要精進我的中文能力而已。
12781	366	8	110	en-US	The next court is set on 6/24 in 2018. The time is 4:30 P.M. We will ask questions for the witness. If the both party have necessary assistance, you can have a lawyer.

12801	372	8	24	en-US	First, you have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.
12802	372	8	25	en-US	Second, you have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low-income family, a medium-and-low-income family, or if you are an aborigine, or meet other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.
12803	372	8	26	en-US	Third, you have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you with the case.

12806	372	8	29	en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.
12807	372	8	30	en-US	Same as the indictment.
12808	372	8	31	en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of an adultery case. The accuser Yu-Han Wang filed this case because his husband Edward Takayashi had a relationship beyond co-workers with a woman in the cram school he works in. There were intimate messages between the two of them and the defendant had made up reasons for working long nights. He also tele-conferenced with Rong-Er Huang at midnight. The accuser believed they have a relationship beyond co-workers. The defendant, your wife has accused you of adultery. What’s your plea?
12809	372	8	32	zh-TW	當然無罪
12810	372	8	33	en-US	In today’s procedure, we will ask both parties the details of the case to confirm whether the defendant and his colleague constituted adultery. Do both parties understand?
12811	372	8	34	en-US	I understand.
12812	372	8	35	zh-TW	我了解
12813	372	8	36	en-US	The accuser, how long have you married your husband? Do you have children?
12814	372	8	37	en-US	I was married to him four years ago and we don’t have any kids.
12815	372	8	38	en-US	When did your marriage take place? Was it in Taiwan or abroad?
12816	372	8	39	en-US	We met in Taiwan four years ago. He came to Taiwan because he wants to teach Portuguese.
12817	372	8	40	en-US	So in the past few years, his job was to teach Portuguese?
12818	372	8	41	en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still teaches Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan. His teaching hours can be very low sometimes. Like..the period between jobs is like one to two month. In order to have a stable income, he decided to switch to teaching English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.
12819	372	8	42	en-US	You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree, does it mean that he want to have a degree in Taiwan?
12820	372	8	43	en-US	No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to get a degree on English-teaching. He found a distance learning program online from California so he can have distance learning instead of taking course in the USA. After he finishes all his courses, he can get a master degree. Therefore, he is able to get a job in Taiwan.
12821	372	8	44	en-US	What is his relationship with the person he has an affair with?
12822	372	8	45	en-US	They were colleagues at the same working place. The cram school will partner an English teacher with a Chinese teacher. They were partners.
12823	372	8	46	en-US	How did you assume that they have adultery?
12824	372	8	47	en-US	At first, I noticed my husband will often stay at the cram school for long hours. I asked him several times. It was merely an English cram school, why did he need to work for such long hours. He told me he partnered with a Chines teacher and there was a lot to communicate with on teaching programs. I had no doubt with him in the beginning. However, when I found out that he got a lot of calls after he got back home and he would hide to the study room to answer them. So I decided to check his cellphone.
12825	372	8	48	en-US	Did you find anything suspicious on his phone?
12826	372	8	49	en-US	In his phone book, there was a number he often called and answered. So I was curious and I checked his messages and I found out he had been texting this girl for a long time.
12827	372	8	50	en-US	Even if they text each other, it was merely messages. Or is there any inappropriate messages?
12828	372	8	51	en-US	He is a married man. Why did the woman text him intimate messages? I have provided files to the court previously. The evidence should be in the files.
12829	372	8	52	en-US	Check and confirm the evidence used in the case. Investigatory record p.13, are these the messages you sent, defendant?
12830	372	8	53	zh-TW	是的，這是我手機上的簡訊內容。
12831	372	8	54	en-US	Now I am going to ask you some questions based on these messages. The first message was sent on December 12th ,2018 at 9:50 pm. It was sent by the number 0958-932123. The content is「I really miss you, my love」. What does that mean?
12832	372	8	55	zh-TW	那封簡訊是我同事傳來的，我記得那時候請了兩天假，她有點擔心我，所以才傳的。我同事在美國受教育所以她思想比較開放，至於我的愛呢，那只是我們對在乎的人的稱呼。
12833	372	8	56	en-US	You mean that because your colleague is educated in the US before so she is westernized and has an open mind so my love does not mean anything special?
12834	372	8	57	zh-TW	對阿，那只是對在乎的人一個常用的稱呼而已。
12835	372	8	58	en-US	How about the “I miss you” part?
12836	372	8	59	zh-TW	就像我剛剛說的，那時候我請了兩天的假，她自然就打出了那些字阿。
12837	372	8	60	en-US	Do you mean the reason she sent the message is because at then you took two days off and without your assistance she missed you a lot.
12838	372	8	61	zh-TW	是阿，內容大致如此，那簡訊沒什麼大不了的。
12839	372	8	62	en-US	The second message was sent on December 29th , 2018 at 11:55pm, and it was sent by the same number, the content was “ I want you by my side, when can we be truly together? ” what does this mean?
12840	372	8	63	zh-TW	她傳這封訊息來教我怎麼正確表達在我作業上的中文句子。
12841	372	8	64	en-US	She sent the message because she wanted to help you in the assignment? What does that mean?
12842	372	8	65	zh-TW	就像我太太告知法院的，要完成碩士學位，我必須修滿三十學分，所以我自然有一些功課要做。
12843	372	8	66	en-US	Could you please explain what the program of your master degree is?
12844	372	8	67	zh-TW	我的碩士學位是有關英語教學的，除了教學以外還有些課程和文化跟語言能力有關。
12845	372	8	68	en-US	So your master degree was about TESOL and there are some cultural communication programs?
12846	372	8	69	zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三堂有關文化溝溝通的課程
12847	372	8	70	en-US	What is your homework in those courses?
12848	372	8	71	zh-TW	這樣的課程會給學生們不同的作業，像我在台灣是要找一個英文教學的工作，為了達到這個目標，我需要證明我中文很好。所以我的作業裡面有很多關於中翻英的句子。
12849	372	8	72	en-US	So because you plan to teach English in Taiwan, the homework is to somewhat prove your Chinese ability by giving you assignments on translating sentences?
12850	372	8	73	zh-TW	是的，同時我也被要求要精進我的口說和寫作能力。
12851	372	8	74	en-US	Back to what we mentioned, this is your homework right?
12852	372	8	75	zh-TW	是的，我記得那句。當我看到那些中文句子，我不知道怎麼翻譯成英文，中文字對外國人來說有時候很難理解，所以我就向她尋求幫助，然後再叫她回傳答案給我。
12853	372	8	76	en-US	So you mean you told your colleague the Chinese version of the sentence and she sent it back the English version by messages and it is merely the answer to the homework?
12854	372	8	77	zh-TW	那封簡訊只是我作業的答案而已。
12855	372	8	78	en-US	So back to investigatory file one page 14 to 16, please take a look at those messages. Are they all sent by this colleague because she wanted to help you on your assignment?
12856	372	8	79	zh-TW	是的這些簡訊都只是用來解答我的作業而已。
12857	372	8	80	en-US	So what is your explanation about your wife accusing you having an affair with your colleague?
12858	372	8	81	zh-TW	我太太在這事上太小題大作了。我知道她對我並不滿意。從一開始我去修學位時她就沒有給予我任何支持了。如果她能夠表現出一點支持，我就不用向我同事尋求協助了。我認為她應該為這次的誤會負責。
12859	372	8	82	en-US	According to your statements, are there any unhappy events between you and your wife?
12860	372	8	83	zh-TW	結婚一開始，我們的確相處的不錯，後來她就對我教葡萄牙語這件事非常不快，因為我拿不到穩定的授課時數。我的工作就變成我們之間最主要的問題。我沒辦法讓她明白我的挫折和困難。
12861	372	8	84	en-US	So back to your master degree, when did you start the degree and when did it end?
12862	372	8	85	zh-TW	這個課程在2015年的秋季開課的。這是個兩年的學程。照理來說我在2017年的五月就該畢業了。可是因為我做兼職的工作，所以我沒辦法好好完成我的那些作業。就像我說的，我太太並沒有很支持我。在我看來，我是獨自完成這個學位而沒有靠她的任何幫忙。我覺得很累也很挫折。
12863	372	8	86	en-US	The program was to study for two years, but you did not. Why?
12864	372	8	87	zh-TW	我沒辦法完成課堂上的所有作業。還有一些課堂上的要求
12865	372	8	88	en-US	What is the last semester you registered in?
12866	372	8	89	zh-TW	我註冊的最後一學期是2017的春季班。
12867	372	8	90	en-US	As you said the last semester of your registration was in May 2017, but the messages continued seven months later after you should have finished your degree. And why is that?
12868	372	8	91	zh-TW	儘管我沒有完成我的學位，這也不代表我不想精進我的語言能力，在課程結束後我還是有繼續精進我的中文能力。
12869	372	8	92	en-US	Just like you said, you wanted to keep learning Chinese despite you failed to finish your degree?
12870	372	8	93	zh-TW	是的。這就是我向我同事尋求協助的原因。
12871	372	8	94	en-US	So your colleague’s role is to be your tutor?
12872	372	8	95	zh-TW	她不僅是我的家教更是我真心的朋友。
12873	372	8	96	en-US	Did you pay her?
12874	372	8	97	zh-TW	沒有。我原本要給她錢但她拒絕了。
12875	372	8	98	en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why did she still text you at midnight? It is way beyond a colleague’s duty.
12876	372	8	99	zh-TW	所以我說她是非常支持我的。她用她私人時間來幫我回答問題。
12877	372	8	100	en-US	Are you still working at the cram school?
12878	372	8	101	zh-TW	是的，我還在那工作
12879	372	8	102	en-US	And does this colleague still work there?
12880	372	8	103	zh-TW	她還在那邊工作但我們不在是搭檔關係了。
12881	372	8	104	en-US	Does the prosecutor wish to subpoena any witness or investigate any ecidence?
12882	372	8	105	en-US	I hope the court to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, Rong-Er Huang, to explain the reasons and the background of those messages.
12883	372	8	106	en-US	The accuser, do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate for you?
12884	372	8	107	en-US	I heard that the cram school had took some actions. They have persuaded Rong-Er Huang to leave the job because of her relationship with my husband. I want the cram school to clarify the statement.
12885	372	8	108	en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate for you? Your lesson should be finished in May 2017. You shouldn’t make up reasons for texting her seven months later. And your messages were all sent in midnights. Do you have any evidence to help you explain the situation?

12917	378	8	34	en-US	I understand
12918	378	8	35	zh-TW	我明白。
12919	378	8	36	en-US	I want to ask the accuser first. How long have you been married? How many kids do you have?
12920	378	8	37	en-US	I have been married with my husband for four years and we don’t have any kids.
12921	378	8	38	en-US	Then, where did you get married? In Taiwan or in foreign countries?
12922	378	8	39	en-US	My husband and I met in Taiwan and he came to Taiwan in order to teach Portuguese.
12923	378	8	40	en-US	So, in the past four years, did your husband teach Portuguese all the way?
12924	378	8	41	en-US	When we met with each other, he was an Portuguese teacher and he continued to teach Portuguese.However, the learning people of Portuguese in Taiwan is not too much and teaching hours is not stable and the job always has a period between jobs.Because the income is not stable, so my husband decided to learn mother tongue and seek an advanced degree.
12925	378	8	42	en-US	You mentioned that your husband are seeking an advanced degree and does that mean he wants to get a degree in Taiwan?
12926	378	8	43	en-US	No, because my husband want to teach English in Taiwan, so he want to get a degree about English teaching. He searched for a distant learning program from California in America. He just go for a course of distant learning and meets the qualification that he could get a degree.In this way, he can get a master degree of English learning and after he gets the certificate, then he can teach English in Taiwan.
12927	378	8	44	en-US	 So, what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?
12928	378	8	45	en-US	Then, his cram school proposed a case about the combination of Chinese and English teaching and my husband partnered with the Chinese teacher.
12929	378	8	46	en-US	How do you know they have an affair?
12930	378	8	47	en-US	 My husband always stayed in the cram school for the reasons of the too much working load but I don’t think that the loading is too heavy. They said that they had to communicate with the partner about the teaching course. At first, I didn’t have any suspection for my husband but I observed that after he came back, he always has a phone call and didn’t talk about the content of the phone call and always got to the study room to have a phone call, so I started to suspect of my husband.
12931	378	8	48	en-US	So, in the cell phone, do you find something weird?
12932	378	8	49	en-US	I found in his phone book they are too many the same number, so I started to check his message and found that they have a lot of messages with each other.
12933	378	8	50	en-US	Even though they just message to each other, I think it is not too strange. It’s still OK.
12934	378	8	51	en-US	I think if they don’t have nothing, why did they often send intimate messages to each other and use the intimate words and phrases. He has been married and why did he do that?
12935	378	8	52	en-US	The defendant, please look at the indictment 1 page 13. There are some messages. Do you send these intimate messages?
12936	378	8	53	zh-TW	是的，這些親密訊息都是在我手機上。
12937	378	8	54	en-US	Now, I’ m going to ask you some questions based on these intimate messages.The first message happened at 106/12/21 9:50 p.m. and the phone number is 0958-932123 and the message content is “I really miss you, my love.”
12938	378	8	55	zh-TW	那是我其中一個同事發給我的簡訊。因為我前兩天都加班到很晚，所以她關心我的狀況。我同事是受過美式教育的，所以她是非常的劍潭與開放。那至於這個my love，只是我們之間的一個稱謂而已，其實沒有什麼。
12939	378	8	56	en-US	So, do you mean that because your colleague once studied in aboard and her thought is westernized, so the express of the emotion is very open. The phrase ”my love” means nothing, right?
12940	378	8	57	zh-TW	對阿!那個my love 就只是我們對彼此的稱呼，其實也沒有什麼，就是西方稱呼彼此都是這樣。
12941	378	8	58	en-US	Then, what’s your explanation about the previous sentence?
12942	378	8	59	zh-TW	就像我說的，她只是單純擔心我而已。因為我們是同事，工作壓力比較大，她當然會關心我啊!
12943	378	8	60	en-US	So, do you mean that because you have not gone to work for two days and don’t assist with your course, so she sent the message to concern you?
12944	378	8	61	zh-TW	是的，那就是訊息的內容阿!沒有什麼其他的。
12945	378	8	62	en-US	Ok, and the second message was sent at 11:55 p.m. 106/12/29 from the same person and the message was that “I want you by my side, when do we get together?”
12946	378	8	63	zh-TW	她只是傳這封簡訊來向我詢問說這個句子的意思與表達。
12947	378	8	64	en-US	So, do you mean that your colleague sent a message to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?
12948	378	8	65	zh-TW	就像我太太之前說的，我曾經修習英語教學的碩士學位，要30學分才能畢業，常常需要完成一些作業和練習，她只是幫我罷了。
12949	378	8	66	en-US	What do you study in your master degree?
12950	378	8	67	zh-TW	我的碩士學位是關於英語教學的，那主要是學習英語教學，還有學習語言文化相關，還有語言能力。
12951	378	8	68	en-US	So, do you mean that you get a master degree of English teaching and the course is combined with some culture communication?
12952	378	8	69	zh-TW	是的，我記得有三門關於文化溝通的。
12953	378	8	70	en-US	So, what kind of assignment do the culture communication courses often assign?
12954	378	8	71	zh-TW	這個跨文化溝通的課程其實是非常的不一樣的。像我就是要尋找一個英語教學的職位，那我必須要對於中文有非常好的造詣。因此，我的作業很多都是關於英中翻譯的。
12955	378	8	72	en-US	So, do you mean that because you want to teach Chinese in Taiwan, so you have to finish the English courses about culture communication and the assignment is always about English-Chinese translation?
12956	378	8	73	zh-TW	是的，我也必須要常常精進我的寫作與口說能力。
12957	378	8	74	en-US	Let’s get back to the sentence…
12958	378	8	75	zh-TW	對的，因為我對於中文其實沒有很了解，所以我就傳了中文句子給我同事，請她幫我翻譯，然後她把中文翻好之後再用英文傳過來。
12959	378	8	76	en-US	So, do you mean that the assignment you sent some Chinese sentence to your colleague and your colleague sent back the English translation? In other words, is that the answer of the translation?
12960	378	8	77	zh-TW	那個簡訊就是那個中文句子的翻譯解答。
12961	378	8	78	en-US	The defendant, please look at the indictment 1 page 14-16 and please quickly browse these messages and I want to ask you that are these messages is all about the assignment?
12962	378	8	79	zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊的傳送都是為了幫助我完成作業?
12963	378	8	80	en-US	So, your wife accused you for the adultery and what’s your explanation about this?
12964	378	8	81	zh-TW	關於這件事，我覺得我老婆想太多了。她認為我沒有能力支持家庭，而且她在我學習的時候，我老婆也從來沒有對我有任何幫助阿。因為在我就讀碩士時候，其實她沒有給我什麼幫助。那假設她能給予我幫助的話，就是不用傳那麼多訊息去尋求幫助了，所以我覺得她應該被這件事被譴責。
12965	378	8	82	en-US	According to the sentence from both parties, I think that your married life is not too good.
12966	378	8	83	zh-TW	在我們感情的初期，其實是過的有點苦，特別是在我尋求葡萄牙文的工作時候，因為當時後收入不是很穩定。因此，我老婆對於我工作不穩定其實不諒解，我們常常因為此事而吵架。我老婆甚至沒有體諒我所遇到的挫折及遇到的困難。
12967	378	8	84	en-US	OK, let’s get back to the master degree. When did you start your master degree and when did you finish? Did you get a degree?
12968	378	8	85	zh-TW	這個碩士學位是從2015年的四月開始。原本預計是2017年五月會取得學位，但是因為其實在過程中很少有時間去認真完成作業，所以最後還是還沒有得到學位。就像我說的，我的太太在我的求學過程中，其實沒有給我任何幫助，所以我一直都是孤單一個人去追尋我的夢想，努力取得學位，所以我非常的疲累與挫折。
12969	378	8	86	en-US	So, do you mean that your master is long for two years and you didn’t finish, why?
12970	378	8	87	zh-TW	因為我沒辦法完成所有的作業，而且還有一些課程上的要求也沒有達成。
12971	378	8	88	en-US	Then, what's the date of the last registration?
12972	378	8	89	zh-TW	上一次最後註冊日期是2107年...
12973	378	8	90	en-US	As you said, the courses ended at in 2017/05 and the learning should not be continued to July, then why do you still send the messages in July?
12974	378	8	91	zh-TW	雖然碩士學位已經結束了，但是我還是非常積極的學中文，所以在那之後，我還是持續的學習中文，而且也非常努力的研讀。
12975	378	8	92	en-US	So, do you mean that after the program, you still want to learn Chinese, so you study very hard alone, right?
12976	378	8	93	zh-TW	是的，這也就是為什麼我會尋求同事的幫忙。
12977	378	8	94	en-US	So, in other words, your colleague played the role like your tutor, right?
12978	378	8	95	zh-TW	對我來說，她不只是一位家教，也是一位很好的朋友?
12979	378	8	96	en-US	Then, do you pay to her?
12980	378	8	97	zh-TW	並沒有，其實我有想要給她錢，但是她拒絕了。
12981	378	8	98	en-US	If you didn't pay to her, why did she still passionate to send these messages? Isn't it clear?
12982	378	8	99	zh-TW	所以就是我說因為她非常支持我，所以她願意花自己的時間來教我啊。
12983	378	8	100	en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?
12984	378	8	101	zh-TW	是的，我還在那工作。
12985	378	8	102	en-US	So, does the colleague still work there?
12986	378	8	103	zh-TW	是的，她還在那邊工作，但是我們已經沒有任何課程方面的合作了。
12987	378	8	104	en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any further to add or search for more information?
12988	378	8	105	en-US	My honor, I want to ask the colleague of the defendant, also黃蓉兒from美而美 cram school and talks about the purpose of the messages.
12989	378	8	106	en-US	The accuser, do you have something needs our assistance to investigat
12990	378	8	107	en-US	 I have heard the美而美cram school once took action about the two person, so I want to ask about the evidence form the cram school.
12991	378	8	108	en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want us to investigate?The defendant, since the master degree ended at 2017/05 but after that, you and黃蓉兒still have many interaciton and even after 9 p.m., you and黃蓉兒still send messages, so do you have any evidence want to search about this?
12992	378	8	109	zh-TW	關於這件事，其實我沒有什麼證據能夠提供的。就像我說的，我只是單純因為修習英語教學碩士學位的文化溝通的課程，我只是想要改進我的英文能力。
12993	378	8	110	en-US	The next procedure is at 2:30 p.m., 2017/06/24 and please the defendant and the accuser come to the court. Both parties can hire a lawyer.

13028	384	8	39	en-US	I met with my husband in Taiwan, and he came to Taiwan here because he taught Portuguese.
13029	384	8	40	en-US	So he taught the language is always?
13030	384	8	41	en-US	After our marriage, he kept teaching language as a language teacher. He keeps teaching. But the language is not frequent in Taiwan, so he had no steady class. Often there’s one or two months no class for him. In order to make income steady, he decided to teach English, but English is actually not his mother tongue, so he decided to go to English class.
13031	384	8	42	en-US	You mean the course, does it mean the degree?
13032	384	8	43	en-US	No, because he wants to teach in Taiwan, so the degree he wants to get is about teaching English. The file for the America California is far distance course that allowed him to have the course from the far distance. After he gets the credit, he will get the master degree. And after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan.

13034	384	8	45	en-US	They are colleagues in a cram school. The cram school has Chinese teacher and English teacher at the same class, and the one in this love affair is the Chinese teacher in the class.

13036	384	8	47	en-US	At the first I discover my husband stayed in the school for a long time. I wonder that is only an English cram school, why did he have to stay there for long, and he answered he had to communicate with Chinese teacher.

13037	384	8	48	en-US	When you checked the phone, did you find anything strange?
13038	384	8	49	en-US	I found a regular number in his phone, so I checked the email and I found there are many emails about the colleagues that almost contact each other every day.
13039	384	8	50	en-US	It seems common for the message, is that strange in the content in the message?
13040	384	8	51	en-US	If this is only a common message, that’s OK. But there are often some strange words and imitate words in the message. I have filed it to the court, that should be in the file there

13044	384	8	55	zh-TW	那封信是我同事傳給我的，我記得那時候我請了兩天假，她很擔心我，所以才傳了這封簡訊來。我的同事是接受美國教育，心胸非常開闊，那只不過是她講話的一種方式來表述自己想要表達的。「my love」只不過是一個我們對於一個在乎人所用的用法。
13045	384	8	56	en-US	The messenger is from the US and her way to speak is so open, so ‘my love’ means nothing, is it right?
13046	384	8	57	zh-TW	對啊，那根本就沒有代表什麼，它只不過就是互相表達關心的詞而已。
13047	384	8	58	en-US	How about the former sentence?
13048	384	8	59	zh-TW	正如我前面所說的，我沒去上班的兩天，她很想我。

13053	384	8	64	en-US	You mean she send this message it do the homework, and what does it mean?
13054	384	8	65	zh-TW	在我老婆告我之前，我還有13個學分要拿，要拿到這13個學分我才能取得碩士學位，所以我還有作業和練習題要做
13055	384	8	66	en-US	Could you explain first what did you study for the mast degree?
13056	384	8	67	zh-TW	我的碩士課程大部分是英文課程，還有一些文化課程和能力課程。
13057	384	8	68	en-US	You mean the degree you get is for English teaching but there are other culture and communication courses
13058	384	8	69	zh-TW	是啊，我記得至少有3堂是文化與溝通的課程。

13060	384	8	71	zh-TW	這門課文化與溝通的課程每個學生的作業都不太一樣，像我是待台灣，我就必須要證明我可以精準的駕馭中文，還有我的中文能力這樣子。因此我中文很多都是中英翻譯。
13061	384	8	72	en-US	You mean because you have to teach Taiwanese English so you have to prove your Chinese ability so there are a lot of Chinese and English assignments for you, is it?

13074	384	8	85	zh-TW	我是在2015開始，預計2017年結束，但因為我一直有在兼職，所以我一直無法完成我的碩士課程。就像我說的，我太太一點都不支持我，我必須獨力完成這個學位，我覺得很累很挫折挫敗。

13084	384	8	95	zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，還是我的朋友。
13085	384	8	96	en-US	Did you pay her?
13086	384	8	97	zh-TW	沒有，我想要付，但她婉拒。
13087	384	8	98	en-US	If you didn’t her, why did she send the messages in the middle of the night? Doesn’t that exceed the relationship between you and the colleague?

13132	389	8	37	en-US	We have been married for four years. We don’t have any child.
13133	389	8	38	en-US	Are you married in Taiwan? Or other place?
13134	389	8	39	en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan four years ago. He came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
13135	389	8	40	en-US	So, in the past years, did he work as an Portuguese teacher?
13136	389	8	41	en-US	The time we met, he was an Portuguese teacher, and now he’s still teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese in Taiwan is not popular with people, so his teaching-hours are often not stable. (yeah… not stable… from one to two hours per week…) After that in order to make his income more stable, so he decided to teach English as well. But English is not his mother tongue, so he tried to seek an advanced degree.
13137	389	8	42	en-US	You just said that (X2) he wanted to… your husband wanted to seek an advanced degree. That means get an degree in Taiwan?
13138	389	8	43	en-US	No, I mean he wants to… teach English, so the degree he needs is about a teaching qualification. My husband found a distance learning program on-line and it is a program from California, the United States. And the program provides on-line learning so that he doesn’t need to go to the USA and he can learn English on teaching… for teaching. After he finished his class, got his… all the credits he needs, he can… could obtain the master degree in the USA, and he can use the degree to teach English in Taiwan.
13139	389	8	44	en-US	Then, the relationship between your husband and the person he has affair with… what is the relationship?
13140	389	8	45	en-US	They are coworkers in a cram school. The cram school… the class in the cram school needs a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher to teach English together. The affair person is the Chinese teacher.
13141	389	8	46	en-US	How did you know they have an affair?
13142	389	8	47	en-US	At first, I often ask my husband why did he always stay up late in the cram school. It’s just an English class. There’s no need for staying up late in the cram school, but my husband told me that he had something to discuss with his Chinese teacher… for teaching. I did not… doubt my husband at first, but days pass… days has passed, my husband would get some calls in our home after getting off the cram school, and he will answer the phone into… in his study room so I have no choice but to doubt him.
13143	389	8	48	en-US	Did you find anything inordinary stuffs… messages?
13144	389	8	49	en-US	There is a same num… a very same number in his phone record so I checked my husband cell phone’s messages, and I found that my husband chatted with the woman very often.
13145	389	8	50	en-US	It just… they are just text messages. Anything not okay?
13146	389	8	51	en-US	If they are some work stuff messages, that’s okay. I found very intimate words the woman used to text in the message, and my husband is married with me, you know, so that’s quite not okay.
13147	389	8	52	en-US	Please display the exhibit file on page 13. The accuser, are these your… the messages you said…
13148	389	8	53	zh-TW	是的，這就是…這些是我手機上的訊息。
13149	389	8	54	en-US	Well then I am going to ask you some questions about these messages. The first message was sent at 09:50 p.m. on December 21st, 2017 from the cell phone number 0958-932123, and the message said, “I miss you, my love”, what do you want to say?
13150	389	8	55	zh-TW	那只是我同事發給我的訊息啊。我記得我那時候剛好放了兩天假，我同事就只是關心我而已啊。我同事在美國讀書然後畢業…在美國接受教育的，所以她的思想相對也是開放許多。我們就…平常打打鬧鬧的…我們對於在乎的人會說my love這樣。
13151	389	8	56	en-US	So you mean that your coworker is westernized on his… her thoughts and her expression for feelings because she got the education in the US, so “my love” is nothing special?
13152	389	8	57	zh-TW	沒錯，那就只是…對於在乎的人所傳達的關心方式，真的沒有什麼。
13153	389	8	58	en-US	How about the previous sentence… in the message?
13154	389	8	59	zh-TW	就像我說的，我們就是同事。然後她很…比較擔心我一點，因為我兩天都沒去上班去放假這樣。
13155	389	8	60	en-US	Do you mean that… your coworker she is quite… she missed you because you have two day-off and there is no assistance on teaching…
13156	389	8	61	zh-TW	對，訊息的內容就是這樣，它的意思也是這樣。
13157	389	8	62	en-US	The second message was sent from the same… the exact same number at 11:55 p.m. on December 29th, 2017. The content is… writes as when can she be with you… “I want you so bad…”
13158	389	8	63	zh-TW	她這樣說只是為了告訴我，我在…我的一個…我剛剛寫到一個中文的作業要怎樣表達這樣…要怎樣表達一個豐富情感的句子。
13159	389	8	64	en-US	You saying that she sent you the message to help you on your assignment...? What are you talking about?
13160	389	8	65	zh-TW	就像之前…先前我老婆跟你們講的…我太太跟你們講的，我正在攻讀一個英語教學的碩士學位，而我需要30個學分才可以完成這個學位，所以在這之前有一些習作也是很正常的。
13161	389	8	66	en-US	Could you first explain your… what exactly you are preparing for the degree.
13162	389	8	67	zh-TW	我的學位是有關TESOL這個英語教學的系統…然後裡面除了英語教學外，也有一些文化相關的課程…或是語言能力相關的課程。
13163	389	8	68	en-US	So, the program you take needs not… has not only TESOL or… and courses about culture…communication…
13164	389	8	69	en-US	對啊，有至少三個是有關文化溝通的課程。
13165	389	8	70	zh-TW	What kind of assignment the courses will need you to complete?
13166	389	8	71	zh-TW	這些文化溝通的課程對每個人來說…每個人選的都有點不同，像我現在住在台灣，而且我準備要來教英文，所以我會需要這個…會需要一些能力在中文上。所以囉，我的一些作業就是有關中英翻譯的一些句子。
13167	389	8	72	en-US	So, according to your words, the program you need… and you need to translate some sentences between Chinese and English, right?
13168	389	8	73	zh-TW	對，我也需要精進我的閱讀跟寫作的能力在中文方面。
13169	389	8	74	en-US	Let’s get back to the sentence. It is one of your assignment?
13170	389	8	75	zh-TW	是啊，我讀到了一些句子，可是你也知道有一些中文字對外國人來說就是比較難理解，所以我請我的同事翻譯給我…翻譯成英文給我，讓我去明白句子的意思。
13171	389	8	76	en-US	Well, you are telling me that you ask your coworker to translate the sentence into English… from Chinese to English for you, and that is the answer… and then send text message to you as the answer for your exercises?
13172	389	8	77	zh-TW	對，那個就只是我功課的…那個訊息就只是我功課的解答。
13173	389	8	78	en-US	The defendant, we will go on to show you the file on page… the exhibit on page 14 to 16. So these are all part of your homework, right?
13174	389	8	79	zh-TW	沒錯，這些所有看到的句子都是在幫助我完成我的作業。
13175	389	8	80	en-US	Then, in terms of the affair your wife accused you, what’s your explanation?
13176	389	8	81	zh-TW	對此，我真的是覺得我太太真的是想太多了，我真的沒有做什麼。而且我也只是想讓自己可以更支持這個家這樣。而且庭上，請你知道，我在進修的時候我太太是完全沒給任何精神支持的。我太太真的是沒有幫助我太多，如果她能對於我在進修這件…進修英文這件事上，提供更多的協助的話，我也就不需要拜託我的同事來協助我，她才是那個需要被責怪的人。而且還造成這些誤解，真的很抱歉。
13177	389	8	82	en-US	According to your words, there’s… there seems to be unpleasure… unhappiness between you and your wife.
13178	389	8	83	zh-TW	我們剛…結婚沒多久的時候，我們都還…相處地都還很愉快很融洽，可是我的工作就是很不穩定，尤其在授課時數方面，因為真的沒什麼人要學葡萄牙文。所以漸漸地我們常為了我的工作而爭吵，我老婆都不知道我做了多少努力在想要去好好地維持這份工作上，而她也完全不知道我有多挫敗在遭遇了這些失敗上。
13179	389	8	84	en-US	Let’s get back to your program. When did it start? When did it end? (Do you know? And can you tell us?)
13180	389	8	85	zh-TW	我在2015年秋天開始了…開始去參與這個課程，它是個兩年期的課程。原本預計是在2017年5月會結束，可是我陸陸續續地在打工啊什麼的，所以我也是沒有完成這個學位這樣。就像我說的，我太太在對於我…進修英文這方面真的是沒有給予很大的支持，日子久了我也就感到很疲倦因為讓我覺得我是自己在奮鬥的這樣子，我真的很灰心。
13181	389	8	86	en-US	You’re saying that the course is a two-year course. But why did you… didn’t you accomplish it? 
13182	389	8	87	zh-TW	因為我沒辦法完成所有課程的作業。還有一些課程相關的規定。
13183	389	8	88	en-US	So when is the last semester of your registration?
13184	389	8	89	zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是在2017年的春天。
13185	389	8	90	en-US	We know that your course ended in May 2017, then after this… after all of this, why… why those messages can… will show up in your text messages record…
13186	389	8	91	zh-TW	就算我沒辦法完成我的學業，也不代表我不想要精進我的中文能力。所以我為了更精進它，所以我就是自己繼續學下去這樣。
13187	389	8	92	en-US	According to that, even if you did not finish the course, you still want to make progress in your Chinese, is that right?
13188	389	8	93	zh-TW	對啊，這就是為什麼我才要向我同事尋求協助。
13189	389	8	94	en-US	Well, the role your coworker play is kind of tutor of your Chinese?
13190	389	8	95	zh-TW	她不僅僅是我的中文家教，她真的是一個很好的朋友。
13191	389	8	96	en-US	Did you pay her for the tutor?
13192	389	8	97	zh-TW	沒有…我有試著要付錢給她，可是她說不用。
13193	389	8	98	en-US	Well, you didn’t pay her. But why did she text you in such night… That is telling that you are beyond coworkers’ relationships?
13194	389	8	99	zh-TW	所以囉，我說，她真的是很幫助我的一個朋友。尤其花了…犧牲了她那些時間來幫助我學中文。
13195	389	8	100	en-US	Do you still work as an English teacher in that cram school?
13196	389	8	101	zh-TW	對，我依然在那裏就職。
13197	389	8	102	en-US	So do your coworker?
13198	389	8	103	zh-TW	她依然在那邊上班，但我們已經不再是教學的夥伴了。
13199	389	8	104	en-US	Prosecutor, any more witness or any further evidence needed to be investigate?
13200	389	8	105	en-US	Your honor, I would like to subpoena the defendant’s coworker 蓉兒黃 at his 美而美 cram school. I would like to ask her about the detail and the intention about those messages.
13201	389	8	106	en-US	The accuser, anything you want… is there anything you want the court to investigate?
13202	389	8	107	en-US	I heard that the cram school has take some… has taken action for the incident my husband and his coworker… and I even heard that the cram school asked his coworker to step out of the work.
13203	389	8	108	en-US	And the defendant, is there anything you want the court to help you investigate? It is a fact that the defendant your course is… your courses ended May 2017, so there’s no need about the assignment stuff you need to deal with, and that makes those messages quite dubious because you received them in the really night and that is quite out of control.
13204	389	8	109	zh-TW	我真的沒有什麼證據想要法院為我調查。就…一直都像我說的，我跟她會聊天，真的是單純就是我想精進我的中文，因為我真的想繼續學它這樣。
13205	389	8	110	en-US	So the next court is set on… at 04:30 p.m. on June 24th, 2018. The court will ask some questions from the witness, and both the accuser and the defendant need to come to the court and both of you can hire a lawyer.

Therefore, his teaching hour is not steady, and sometime his…he had a period between jobs for about one or two months.  Because teaching Portuguese is not a steady work, he decided to teach English, and because his mother tongue is not English, he went to seek an advance degree.

At first, I didn’t suspect him, but he started to have some phone calls after his work, and moreover, when he pick up the calls, he would avoid me and went to the study room. And I started to suspect him and check up his cell phone.

13283	395	8	82	en-US	According to your words, is there anything wrong with your relationship between your wife and you?
13284	395	8	83	zh-TW	在我們一開始剛結婚的時候，我們的確相處得很好，但是後來因為我工作的關係，我一開始沒有辦法有穩定的工作時數。因此，工作這件事情就成為我們爭吵的主要原因，我們為了這件事情已經爭吵了非常多次，我也覺得很沮喪，但是也沒有甚麼發洩的方法。

13377	401	8	70	en-US	Then about this kind of courses related to culture and communication, ugh what assignments would these courses, ugh, required you to ……achieve? to complete?
13378	401	8	71	zh-TW	呃，這種文化與溝通課程給每個人的作業都不太一樣。就舉我自己的例子而言，因為我是一個在台灣的外國人，然後想要，嗯…在台灣得到…可以、可以教英文的能力，所以我必須要表現出我對中文的…掌握能力。所以我很多的作業都是跟中英翻譯有關。
13379	401	8	72	en-US	Well, you mean that because you plan to teach English in Taiwan. So umm … these courses ugh … required you to complete some assignments, and these assignments are related to Chinese and English sentences translation. Is that right?
13380	401	8	73	zh-TW	是的。另外我也要精進自己的口說和寫作能力。
13381	401	8	74	en-US	Okay then let’s go back to ……the text … the text message. Did you say that this …is …your assignment?
13382	401	8	75	zh-TW	對，我記得那時候我看到這個句子的時候，我不是很能理解它到底在寫什麼。你也知道的，對外國人來說，中文字有一些非常地難以閱讀、難以辨認，所以我就給我的同事看了這個句子，然後請她告訴我這句話用英文怎麼說，並把它打成簡訊寄給我。
13383	401	8	76	en-US	Did you mean that, ugh…because you asked your co-worker to …told you the answer of this sentence …the translation of this sentence and send you a text message to, ugh …for the answer, so this message was simply the answer of your assignment? Is that right?
13384	401	8	77	zh-TW	那條簡訊只是我作業的答案。
13385	401	8	78	en-US	Okay then let’s ugh …take a look at exhibit evidence one, page 14, the text messages contexts. Could you …ugh …take a look at those contents?

13386	401	8	79	zh-TW	沒錯，全部的簡訊都只是為了要完成作業。
13387	401	8	80	en-US	Then ugh …according to what your wife just said that you had an affair with another person, do you have anything to say?
13388	401	8	81	zh-TW	呃，對這件事，我認為我的妻子想太多了。我知道她一直對我無法支持這個家庭經濟的能力感到失望、不滿；但我想說的是，從我開始上這、這、這個課程到現在，我的妻子也沒有提供我任何幫…任何支持。她從來都沒有…表現出支持我的樣子，對於我念碩士這一件事情。那就是為什麼我會尋求我的同事幫助我做作業。如果她可以多一…表現出多一點點支持，我可能就不會尋求我同事了。我認為，關於這件事情，她應該要受到責備。
13389	401	8	82	en-US	According to what you just said, you and your wife seem to be not ugh …very …accordance in your getting along with?
13390	401	8	83	zh-TW	在我們剛結婚的時候，我們確實滿快樂的。但後來出現了問題，而這問題就是關於我的工作。因為我想在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是這份工作又不太穩定。於是後來這件事情就變成我們之間的問題。我們常常為了這個吵架，她不相信我已經盡我最大的努力，所以…我也沒有讓她知道我所面臨的艱難處境以及…困難的狀況。
13391	401	8	84	en-US	Well, okay. Then let’s go back to …ugh, the master …courses you …just mentioned …about. So did you finish your master courses, all of your credits? Did you get the master degree?
13392	401	8	85	zh-TW	這個碩士是從2015年的秋天開始的。然後它是一個兩年的碩士學位，所以我應該要在2017年的5月完成這個學位。但是我並沒有完成。因為我又開始做一些兼職工作，所以我一直沒有時間可以好好地完成我的作業。就像我剛所說的，我的太太並沒有ㄕ…表示出任何的支持。所以在追求這個碩士學位的時候，我覺得我是一個人在讀這個學位的。我覺得非常地沮喪與挫折。
13393	401	8	86	en-US	You said that this master degree is ugh …a two-year courses program, but you didn’t finish and complete it in the end. Why is that?
13394	401	8	87	zh-TW	因為我無法完成所有的作業。也無法達到一部分要求。

13398	401	8	91	zh-TW	即使我無法完成我的碩士學位，但我仍然想精進我的中文能力。所以雖然我沒有辦法成功地拿到碩士，我…仍然繼續自己研讀中文。
13399	401	8	92	en-US	You …ugh, what do you mean is that, even if you can’t …ugh get your master degree, you still wanted to …sharper your Chinese ……and let your Chinese be more fluently. Is that right?

13406	401	8	99	zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個…我非常好的朋友，也很支持我。她會用她自己的時間來幫助我學中文。
13407	401	8	100	en-US	Are you still working in that cram school teaching English?
13408	401	8	101	zh-TW	是，我還在那工作。
13409	401	8	102	en-US	And is this colleague still work with you in the cram school?
13410	401	8	103	zh-TW	她也還在那工作，但我們現在不是搭檔了。
13411	401	8	104	en-US	The prosecutor, do you have ugh ……any witness you want to subpoena, or any evidence you want to ins …investigate?

13436	407	8	23	en-US	I’ll inform the defendant’s rights and obligations.
13437	407	8	24	en-US	Firstly, you have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.
13438	407	8	25	en-US	Secondly, you have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low-income family, medium-and-low-income family, or you are an aborigine, or meet other qualification set by the law, you might ask the court for legal assistance.
13439	407	8	26	en-US	Thirdly, you have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you with your case.
13440	407	8	27	en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?
13441	407	8	28	zh-TW	是的。
13442	407	8	29	en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.
13443	407	8	30	en-US	Same as the indictment. 
13444	407	8	31	en-US	Today we are her for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The accuser, Yu Han Wang, is filing this case because she suspected her husband, Edward Takayashi, is having an affair with his colleague in the cram school he worked at. The accuser found some intimate messages in the defendant’s phone. And the defendant always found reasons to work late. Moreover, the defendant has been seen go out with his colleague, Ron Er Huang, for multiple times. Therefore, the accuser suspected that the defendant was having an affair.The defendant, your wife is suing you for adultery. What’s your plea?
13445	407	8	32	zh-TW	我認為我無罪。
13446	407	8	33	en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, we will be focusing on investigating the communication between the defendant and his colleague in order to prove that if he’s having an affair. Do both parties understand the procedure?
13447	407	8	34	en-US	I understand.
13448	407	8	35	zh-TW	我明白。
13449	407	8	36	en-US	First I would like to ask the accuser, how long have you been married to your husband? Do you have kids?
13450	407	8	37	en-US	We have been married for four years and we don’t have kids.
13451	407	8	38	en-US	Well, do you have your wedding in Taiwan or abroad?
13452	407	8	39	en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
13453	407	8	40	en-US	Then, over the past few years, does he keep teaching Portuguese as a job in Taiwan?
13454	407	8	41	en-US	When we first met, he’s a Portuguese teacher. After we were married, he still kept teaching Portuguese.However, Portuguese is not a popular language for Taiwanese to learn. So, his teaching hours were always unstable. There would even be a one or two-month periods between jobs. Therefore, in order to get a more steady income, he decided to teach English.However, English is not his mother tongue. So, he went to seek an advance degree.
13455	407	8	42	en-US	You mentioned that he decided to seek an advance degree. Do you mean earning a degree in Taiwan?
13456	407	8	43	en-US	No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, the degree he has to acquire is TESOL.He went online and found a distance learning program from California, United States. So, he got to stay at home and did the distance learning instead of going abroad.This way, he can earn enough credits to get a master’s degree so that he can get a job of English teaching in Taiwan with this degree from the States.
13457	407	8	44	en-US	Well, what’s the relationship between him and the person he’s having an affair with?
13458	407	8	45	en-US	They are colleagues from the cram school. The cram school will arrange a Chinese teacher to partner with an English teacher. That woman is his partner in the cram school.
13459	407	8	46	en-US	How did you find out their affair?
13460	407	8	47	en-US	At first, I only suspected of working late in the cram school too often. I asked him, “It’s just an English cram school, what’s there to stay late for?” He told me that because of partnering, he had to communicate a lot with his partner.At first, I didn’t really suspect him of having an affair. However, when he got back home from work, he would always get some calls. And he would not answer the calls in front of me. He would even go to the study room to answer the phone. So, I checked his phone.
13461	407	8	48	en-US	Did you find anything unusual in the phone?
13462	407	8	49	en-US	In his phone book, the same number always appeared. So, I went to check his text messages. After I checked, I found out that he’s been texting with the same person every day.
13463	407	8	50	en-US	Well, it’s just texting. Are the texts juicy?
13464	407	8	51	en-US	If it’s just regular texting, it’s fine. However, he is a married man. Why would somebody texting some intimate messages. I submitted some of the messages before, so they should be in the investigatory files.
13465	407	8	52	en-US	Show exhibit number one. Check the page thirteen. Defendant, are these the text messages in your phone?
13466	407	8	53	zh-TW	是的，這些是我手機裡的訊息。
13467	407	8	54	en-US	Now, I’m going to ask you some questions regarding these messages.The first one was sent at 9:50 PM, December 21st 2017. The number is 0958932123. The text messages said, “我非常想你。” What does it mean?
13468	407	8	55	zh-TW	呃嗯…是一個同事發給我的。我記得我那時請假了兩天，所以他可能有點擔心我吧，所以才發了這封訊息。我的同事是在美國接受教育的，所以他的思想非常開放，他說話就是那個樣子，至於為什麼會說「我的愛」，這是因為這是我們稱呼我們在乎的人的方式。
13469	407	8	56	en-US	Do you mean that because this colleague is educated in the U.S., her thoughts are pretty westernized. So, “my love” does not mean anything, is that right? 
13470	407	8	57	zh-TW	對的，「我的愛」只是用來稱呼那些很好的朋友或是在乎的人，沒什麼特別的。
13471	407	8	58	en-US	How about the phrase before that?
13472	407	8	59	zh-TW	就像我說的，他只是擔心我而已。我們是工作上的共事夥伴，因此我請了兩天假，他自然而然會想念我。
13473	407	8	60	en-US	What your saying is that just because you took two days off, she missed you without your help at work, she texted you “I miss you.” Is that right?
13474	407	8	61	zh-TW	對的，訊息就只是這樣而已，並沒有什麼大不了的。
13475	407	8	62	en-US	Okay, let’s move on to the next message. Text message number 2 was sent at 11:55 PM, December 29th 2017. It was sent by the same person. The message says “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” So, what does this message mean?
13476	407	8	63	zh-TW	他之所以傳給我這封簡訊是為了教我如何用中文表達。
13477	407	8	64	en-US	You’re saying that the reason that this person texted you this message is to help you with your homework. What does that even mean?
13478	407	8	65	zh-TW	就像我老婆剛剛有提到的，我正在就讀一個碩士學程。我必須要拿到三十學分，所以自然而然的有一些功課跟練習需要操作。
13479	407	8	66	en-US	Can you please first explain what you’re studying in your master’s degree?
13480	407	8	67	zh-TW	我的碩士學程主要為英語教學。在這學程裡當然要學英語教學能力，還有一些文化溝通課程和語文能力的學程。
13481	407	8	68	en-US	You’re trying to earn a master’s degree in TESOL. But there are some cultural communication courses in it, is that right?
13482	407	8	69	zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三個課程是跟文化溝通有官。
13483	407	8	70	en-US	So, what are the assignments for this so-called cultural communication courses?
13484	407	8	71	zh-TW	這些文化溝通的課程對於每個學生來說都不太一樣。以我來說的話，因為我想在台灣找一個教職工作，所以我必須展現我的教學能力及中文上的溝通能力進以達成我的目標。所以，我很多的作業是中英文章的翻譯。
13485	407	8	72	en-US	Because you have to prove that you have the competence to teach in Taiwan, you have to learn Chinese. And a lot of the assignments are about translation. Is that right?
13486	407	8	73	zh-TW	是的，而當然我也被要求須要加強我的口說、寫作能力。
13487	407	8	74	en-US	Let’s get back to the text message. You said that’s your assignment, right?
13488	407	8	75	zh-TW	對的，我還記得那條訊息。你也知道的，有些中文字，對於外國人來說，是很難理解的，所以當我接到這個作業後，我就傳訊息給我那位同事，要他傳答案給我。
13489	407	8	76	en-US	You typed in Chinese and ask your colleague to type in English and text back to you. This text message is just a product of an assignment, right?
13490	407	8	77	zh-TW	是的，那封簡訊只是我作業的答案而已。
13491	407	8	78	en-US	Okay. Let’s show the investigatory records again. From page 14 to page 16, look at all the text messages. Are these all your assignments?
13492	407	8	79	zh-TW	對的，這些訊息的目的都只是為了完成我的作業而已。
13493	407	8	80	en-US	What’s your explanation on your wife accusing you of having an affair with your colleague?
13494	407	8	81	zh-TW	在這件事上，我覺得我太太只是想太多了。我知道我可能無法滿足他對於這個家庭的期望，但在我開始這學位的時候，我太太並沒有展現他的任何支持。他一點都不願意幫助我來完成我的學程，如果他一開始多支持我一點的話，我也根本就不用去問我的搭檔了。所以我覺得，對於這整場誤會，他最該怪的是他自己。
13495	407	8	82	en-US	Based on your testimonies, there’s something unhappy going on between you and your wife, right?
13496	407	8	83	zh-TW	我們婚姻剛開始的時候的確是蠻快樂的。但後來主要的問題就是我的工作，因為在台灣，教葡萄牙語實在無法獲得穩定的薪水跟工作時間。所以我們就越來越疏遠了，我沒辦法讓他明白我的挫折感，我也不知道要怎麼與他溝通。
13497	407	8	84	en-US	Okay. Let’s get back to your master degree. When does your master degree start? Does it end? Did you get your degree?
13498	407	8	85	zh-TW	我是在2015年的秋天開始這個課程的，這是一個兩年的課程，所以我理應該可以在2017年的五月拿到這個學位。但是，我後來並沒有完成，因為我還有兼職的工作，所以我沒有時間做完所有的作業。就像我說的，我太太從一開始就不支持我。所以，我就像是獨自一人在進攻這個學位，到了後來我已經太累，也充滿了挫折感。
13499	407	8	86	en-US	This course is a two-year course, but you did not finish. Why?
13500	407	8	87	zh-TW	我無法完成所有的課程作業。也無法完成一些課程的需求。
13501	407	8	88	en-US	When is the last semester of your registration?
13502	407	8	89	zh-TW	我註冊在學的最後一個學期是2017年的春天。
13503	407	8	90	en-US	As you said, your registration should end on May 2017. So, why are you still texting your colleague long after seven months of the end of your registration? There should be no assignments left, right?
13504	407	8	91	zh-TW	呃，就算我沒有通過這個學程，我還是想要繼續學中文呀。所以我還是繼續自己跟同事傳簡訊來學習、增強我的中文能力。
13505	407	8	92	en-US	What you’re is that even though you did not finish the master’s degree program, you still want to keep on learning Chinese in order to be more fluent on Chinese, right?
13506	407	8	93	zh-TW	沒錯，所以我才尋求我同事的幫助。
13507	407	8	94	en-US	The role your colleague is serving is kind of like your tutor, is that right?
13508	407	8	95	zh-TW	他不只像是我的家教，也是一個真正的朋友。
13509	407	8	96	en-US	Did you pay her?
13510	407	8	97	zh-TW	並沒有，我曾有提過要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
13511	407	8	98	en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why would she, in the middle of the night, way past sleeping hours, still text to help you? Isn’t this relationship beyond co-worker’s relationships?
13512	407	8	99	zh-TW	所以我才說，他是一個很支持我的朋友。他犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學中文！
13513	407	8	100	en-US	Are you still working in that cram school to teach English?
13514	407	8	101	zh-TW	對的，我仍在那裏工作。
13515	407	8	102	en-US	Does this colleague still work at that cram school?
13516	407	8	103	zh-TW	對的，他也仍在這間補習班工作，但我們不再是搭檔了。
13517	407	8	104	en-US	Prosecutor, do you have anyone that you need to summon further to examine? 
13518	407	8	105	en-US	I hope to summon this colleague from Mei Err Mei Cram School, Ron Err Huang, so that she can state this case as a witness and explain those text messages and the background reasons of sending those messages.
13519	407	8	106	en-US	The accuser, do you need this court to summon anyone to investigate further on?
13520	407	8	107	en-US	I heard that the cram school did take some actions on the relationships between those two. And they even asked that woman to quit this job. So I was wondering that if we can confirm this matter from the cram school.
13521	407	8	108	en-US	The defendant, do you have any other further evidences that you want this court to investigate for you?The situation now is that your master degree program already ended on May 2017. You really don’t have the rightful reasons to send these messages and you cannot use assignments as an excuse to justify your relationship with your colleague. It really is suspicious. Do you have any evidences that can help you with this case?
13522	407	8	109	zh-TW	我並沒有任何需要庭上幫我調查的證據。就像我之前說的，我跟我同事的關係非常簡單，我只是想增強我的中文能力而已。
13523	407	8	110	en-US	The next procedure of this case is set at 4:30 PM, on June 24th 2018. We will move on the cross-examination process. Both parties have the right to a lawyer. Do both parties understand? And the accuser and the defendant have to be here.
13524	407	8	111	en-US	I understand.
13525	407	8	112	zh-TW	我也瞭解了。

13693	419	8	68	en-US	So you get a degree of TESOL, and there are some culture and communication courses?
13694	419	8	69	zh-TW	是的我記得有三門課程是與語言文化有關
13695	419	8	70	en-US	What are the assignments of the course Culture and Communication?
13696	419	8	71	zh-TW	在這門課的作業是因人而異的。以我來說，我為了要在台灣取得英語教學工作，我必須要有能力用當地語言溝通。所以我很多作業都是中英翻譯。
13697	419	8	72	en-US	In order to get the English teaching degree, you have to finish some assignments about Chinese-English translation. Is that right?
13698	419	8	73	zh-TW	是的，我還需要精進我的口說與寫作能力。
13699	419	8	74	en-US	Then….Let’s go back to the sentence we just said. Is that your assignment
13700	419	8	75	zh-TW	是的，那是我的作業，當時我看到這個句子我不知道該怎麼翻譯。你也知道，中文字對外國人來說是很困難的，所以我就問我的同事，並請她傳訊息告訴我答案。
13701	419	8	76	en-US	So you meant… because you asked some questions about Chinese, your colleague sent you this message. This is just about the assignment. Is that what you meant?
13702	419	8	77	zh-TW	那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
13703	419	8	78	en-US	Please see the evidence 1, page 14-16. These messages are all your assignment. The person sent you the messages because you need help for your assignments. Is that right?
13704	419	8	79	zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業
13705	419	8	80	en-US	What’s your explanation about your wife accused you had an affair with your coworker?
13706	419	8	81	zh-TW	我太太對這件事情真的是想太多了，我知道她很不滿我沒有那麼多能力去支撐整個家庭，但當時我要去進修的時候她完全沒任何支持。因為他一開始就沒有支持我。如果她當時支持我的話，我就不會去找我同事幫忙，她應該怪罪於自己。
13707	419	8	82	en-US	According to your words, it seems that you didn’t get along with your wife.
13708	419	8	83	zh-TW	我們剛結婚時，的確相處得非常愉快。主要是我工作的問題，因為教授葡萄牙文的時數並不是很固定。所以這就變成我們之間很大的問題，我們常常為這件事吵架，她並不相信我已經盡力，她並不知道我因這件事非常挫折。
13709	419	8	84	en-US	So let’s go back to your master degree. When did you start it? Does it finish? Did you get your degree?
13710	419	8	85	zh-TW	我是在2015年秋季註冊的，那是兩年的課程，我應該會在2017年的五月完成，但我一直有兼職工作，我沒有時間做作業，所以我沒有完成它。就像我所說的，我的太太並沒有支持我，讓我覺得很孤獨、很累，所以我就沒有拿到學位。
13711	419	8	86	en-US	You meant that this program is for two years, and you didn’t finish in the end. Why is that?
13712	419	8	87	zh-TW	我無法完成所有課程的作業。以及一些課程的要求
13713	419	8	88	en-US	When is the last semester you registered?
13714	419	8	89	zh-TW	我最後註冊的學期是2017年的春學期。
13715	419	8	90	en-US	As you mentioned, your program should be finished on 2017 in May. But the messages happened 7 months after the program finished. Why was that?
13716	419	8	91	zh-TW	就算我完成我的學位，這並不代表我不想精進我的語言能力。所以就算我沒有完成我得學位我還是有在自學，精進我的語言能力。
13717	419	8	92	en-US	You meant that even you didn’t finish your program. You still want to learn Chinese to improve your Chinese ability. Is that right?
13718	419	8	93	zh-TW	是的，這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫忙
13719	419	8	94	en-US	So your colleague is just like your tutor. Is that right?
13720	419	8	95	zh-TW	他不只是我的家教，還是我的朋友
13721	419	8	96	en-US	Did you pay her?
13722	419	8	97	zh-TW	不，我曾提出要付她錢，但她拒絕。
13723	419	8	98	en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why would she help you in the midnight? Is that beyond what the coworker has to do?
13724	419	8	99	zh-TW	這就是為什麼我會說他是非常支持我的朋友，她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文。
13725	419	8	100	en-US	Do you still work in that cram school?
13726	419	8	101	zh-TW	是的我還在那工作。
13727	419	8	102	en-US	Does this colleague still work there?
13728	419	8	103	zh-TW	是的，她還在那工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。
13729	419	8	104	en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any evidence that you want to investigate? Do you want to subpoena someone?
13730	419	8	105	en-US	I would like to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, Ron Er Huang. I want her to come to the court to explain the relationship between her and the defendant and explain the content of the messages.
13731	419	8	106	en-US	The accuser, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
13732	419	8	107	en-US	I heard that MeiErMei cram school had tried to deal with their relationship. They even asked their colleague Ron Er Huang to quit the job. I would like to subpoena the officer of the cram school to the court.
13733	419	8	108	en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? According to your words, your program should be finished on May 2017. You have no excuse for that, especially the messages were often sent after 9 pm. Do you have any evidence that you can prove that is just for the assignment?
13734	419	8	109	zh-TW	我目前有任何想要法院幫忙調查的證據。就像我所說的，我與同事之間的關係非常簡單，我只是想要提升我的中文能力而已。
13735	419	8	110	en-US	The next court date will be set on 2018, June 24th, at 4:30 pm. The court will ask some questions to the witnesses. The both parties please make sure to come to the court. If necessary, you can hire a lawyer. Does the both parties understand ?
13736	419	8	111	en-US	I understand.
13737	419	8	112	zh-TW	我明白。

13755	425	8	24	en-US	You have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.
13756	425	8	25	en-US	You have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low-income family, a medium-and-low-income family, or if you are an aborigine or meet other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.

13758	425	8	27	en-US	Does the defendant fully understand his rights?
13759	425	8	28	zh-TW	我了解。
13760	425	8	29	en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.
13761	425	8	30	en-US	Same as the indictment.
13762	425	8	31	en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of an adultery case. The accuser Wang Yuhan, she thinks her husband is having an intimate relationship with his co-worker in the company. The accuser found intimate messages in the phone of his husband and his husband always found excuses for working late in the night. And he always has tele-conferencing with his coworker in the night. This situation, she thinks, has beyond coworker’s relationship, therefore she decided to file an adultery case. Defendant, your wife thinks you’ve committed the case of adultery, what’s your plea? 
13763	425	8	32	zh-TW	我當然沒有罪。
13764	425	8	33	en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, this court will ask the details of the relationship of the defendant and the coworker to decide whether they have committed adultery. Do you fully understand?
13765	425	8	34	en-US	I understand.
13766	425	8	35	zh-TW	我了解。
13767	425	8	36	en-US	Accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have kids?
13768	425	8	37	en-US	We’ve been married for four years, and we do not have kids.
13769	425	8	38	en-US	So do you get married with your husband in Taiwan or in any other countries?
13770	425	8	39	en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
13771	425	8	40	en-US	So in past years, is your husband’s main job about teaching Portuguese?
13772	425	8	41	en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, he continued as a Portuguese teacher. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so my husband always had an unstable condition in teaching Portuguese, for example, he would have few weeks not teaching Portuguese. Therefore, to make his income stable, however, English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced education.
13773	425	8	42	en-US	You just mentioned that your husband decided to seek an advanced program in Taiwan, do you mean he wants a degree in Taiwan?
13774	425	8	43	en-US	No, because he wants to take English-teaching as his job, therefore he must have a TESOL certificate. He found online a distance learning program in California, therefore he didn’t have to go to the US. And he can sit at home and receive distance learning and meet the requirements of the program. After he finished all the credits, he would have a postgraduate degree. Therefore, with such a certificate, he can have a job as an English teacher.
13775	425	8	44	en-US	So What’s the relationship between he and the partner he is having a relationship with?
13776	425	8	45	en-US	The person he is having a relationship with is a co-worker in his class. The teaching school has one Chinese teacher and one foreign teacher for one class. And the woman is the Chinese teacher in his class.
13777	425	8	46	en-US	How do you know they are having an affair?
13778	425	8	47	en-US	At first, he always worked overtime and didn’t come home. I’m confused that it’s only a teaching school. There’s no reason for him to work overtime. He explains that he had to work with a Chinese teacher, and there’s much to communicate with that Chinese teacher. At first, he didn’t think he is having an affair. But later on, I found he constantly received telephone calls at home. And he didn’t receive those phone calls in front of me. Instead, he goes to the study room to receive those phone calls. So I got a little curious about the intention of him and later I checked his cellphone and found the reason.
13779	425	8	48	en-US	Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?
13780	425	8	49	en-US	In his phone book, I found one telephone number constantly showing in his phone book. And therefore, I checked his messages and found that he sent text messages to that number constantly.
13781	425	8	50	en-US	I think it’s ok to send text messages. Is it because the content of the text messages is inappropriate? 
13782	425	8	51	en-US	They are not sending common text massages. Considering he is a married person, it’s not appropriate to send intimate messages to another woman. I have report to the court the content of the messages. I think they are in the files. 
13783	425	8	52	en-US	Exhibit evidence, page 13. Please be noted of the content of the messages. Defendant, please take a look, do you send those messages?
13784	425	8	53	zh-TW	是的， 這些是我手機上的訊息。
13785	425	8	54	en-US	Therefore, I will ask you a few questions about the text messages. The first message is sent by the phone number 0958-932123 at 9:50 pm, on December 21st, 2017. The content is I really miss you, my love, so what’s your explanation?
13786	425	8	55	zh-TW	該簡訊的內容由同事傳給我，當時我記得我休假了兩天，她非常擔心，因此發送了這樣的簡訊。我的同事在美國受教育，思想開放，這也是她之所以這樣談話，這樣表達的原因，至於“My love”的部分，這是我們對關心的人的稱呼。
13787	425	8	56	en-US	Do you mean that the sender received her education in the US, and got very westernized and she is very open-minded about stuffs like emotions, and the phrase my love sent by her does not have any special connotations? 
13788	425	8	57	zh-TW	是的，這樣的話是在朋友間，或是在互相關心的人之間的用法。
13789	425	8	58	en-US	So how about the phrase before my love?
13790	425	8	59	zh-TW	正如我之前所述，她非常擔心我，作為我的同事對於我離開兩天非常擔心。
13791	425	8	60	en-US	So do you mean because you take two days off from work, she got very worried about you and sent you messages like she missed you.
13792	425	8	61	zh-TW	是的，這就是當時的背景情況，那封簡訊沒有什麼大的問題。
13793	425	8	62	en-US	The second message is sent by the same person at 11:55pm on December 29th, 2017. the content is I really want you be my side, when can we be truly together? So what does this text message mean and what does it exist?
13794	425	8	63	zh-TW	她當時寫這封簡訊是告訴我怎麼樣表達我作業中的用法。
13795	425	8	64	en-US	So you mean that the sender sent you this message to help you with this message, what does it mean?
13796	425	8	65	zh-TW	正如我妻子所向法庭所述，我當時正在修讀一個碩士課程，需要完成30分的學分，因此也需要完成一些作業和考試。
13797	425	8	66	en-US	Please explain what on earth your master program is about?
13798	425	8	67	zh-TW	我的碩士課程是英語教學，內容包括英文教學，文化以及語言能力。
13799	425	8	68	en-US	So you mean that there’s something about culture in your English-teaching master program.
13800	425	8	69	zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三門課關於文化與溝通議題。
13801	425	8	70	en-US	What’s the homework of these culture and communications courses.
13802	425	8	71	zh-TW	這樣的一門作業每個人都有所不同，就以我為例，因為我在台灣，希望獲得一個英語教學相關的崗位，要達到這樣的目標，我需要提高自己的英語能力，所以要學好中文。因此我的作業很多方面很多都是中英句子的翻譯。
13803	425	8	72	en-US	So you mean you want to seek an English teaching position in Taiwan, and in this master program you have to prove yourself the Chinese competency. The coursework includes assignments of translating Chinese and English sentences, am I right?
13804	425	8	73	zh-TW	是的，我同樣被要求提升自己的讀寫能力。
13805	425	8	74	en-US	Ok, let’s go back to that text massage. Is that your assignment?
13806	425	8	75	zh-TW	是的，因為我當時寫的作業有一些不太理解，因為中文中有些東西外國人很難認， 因此我就請我的同事幫助我來翻譯，然後將答案傳給我。
13807	425	8	76	en-US	So you sent the Chinese text message to her and she sent back the Chinese answers to you. Is that your homework?
13808	425	8	77	zh-TW	那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
13809	425	8	78	en-US	OK, defendant please look at the file One, page 14 to 16. Please carefully check the content of the messages. Are those messages all the assignments of you? Is it because it’s your homework and you sent them to her to help you with your assignment?
13810	425	8	79	zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊都是同樣的目的，針對我的作業。
13811	425	8	80	en-US	So what’s your explanation in response to your wife’s suit that you have an affair with the third person?
13812	425	8	81	zh-TW	我的妻子把這件事想得太嚴重了，我知道我持家的能力並不是很好，但她沒在剛開始的時候幫助我啊。因為她一直都沒有幫助我完成我的學位，如果不是這樣，我也不會讓同事幫忙，她應該為此負責，這是誤解的原因。
13813	425	8	82	en-US	According to your statement, it seems that you have some unhappy situations with your wife. 
13814	425	8	83	zh-TW	剛開始相處時，我們彼此都度過了愉快的時光， 但問題就在於我的工作，我剛開始在這裡教葡萄牙語，但並不能獲得穩定的 教學時間。之後工作問題就成了我們之間的問題，我們時而為此吵架，她並不理解我的努力也並不知道我的沮喪和當時的困境。
13815	425	8	84	en-US	Ok, let’s go back to the master program, when does this master program start? Does it end? Did you get your diploma?
13816	425	8	85	zh-TW	這個項目開始於2015年的秋季，應當耗時2年時間，並在2017年5月結束，但是我當時在兼職，我沒有足夠的時間做作業，所以並沒有完成學位。正如我所言，我的妻子在我這個碩士項目上並沒有很幫助我，我覺得我彷彿一個人在追求這個學位，因此非常累也非常沮喪。
13817	425	8	86	en-US	You mean this is a two-year program, and you failed to finish it, what’s the reason?
13818	425	8	87	zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有的課程作業。也沒辦法完成課堂的要求。
13819	425	8	88	en-US	So when is the end of the last semester registration?
13820	425	8	89	zh-TW	最後註冊的學期是2017年春季。
13821	425	8	90	en-US	As you said, the last semester is May 2017, therefore you shouldn’t have assignment from then on. But the text messages last 7 months after the completion of your master program, what’s your explanation?
13822	425	8	91	zh-TW	好吧，儘管我沒有完成自己的碩士項目，但這並不意味著我不能繼續學習中文， 所以結束後，我也是想繼續提升自己的中文能力，所以我繼續一個人努力。
13823	425	8	92	en-US	So you mean that although you didn’t complete your master program, you still want to sharpen you Chinese competency, am I right?
13824	425	8	93	zh-TW	是的，這也是我讓我同事幫助我的原因。
13825	425	8	94	en-US	So the role played by your co-worker is like a home teacher, right?
13826	425	8	95	zh-TW	對我來說，她不僅像個家教，更像是個很好的朋友。
13827	425	8	96	en-US	Did you pay the tuition to her?
13828	425	8	97	zh-TW	沒有，我之前說要給她學費，但她拒絕了。
13829	425	8	98	en-US	If you didn’t pay her, is it beyond coworker’s relationship that she sent text messages to you to answer your questions at midnight?
13830	425	8	99	zh-TW	正如我之前所說，她真的在幫助我，利用她的閒餘時間幫我學中文。
13831	425	8	100	en-US	Do you still teach at that teaching school?
13832	425	8	101	zh-TW	是的，我仍在那裏工作。
13833	425	8	102	en-US	Does your coworker still work there?
13834	425	8	103	zh-TW	是的，她也在那裡教學，但我們並沒有組成一個班。
13835	425	8	104	en-US	Prosecutor, is there any evidence you want to investigate or any witness you want to ask to the court?
13836	425	8	105	en-US	This court wants to subpoena the colleague Huang Rong’er, to explain the relationship between these two and the context as well as the purpose of these text massages.
13837	425	8	106	en-US	Accuser, is there anything you want the court to further investigate?
13838	425	8	107	en-US	I heard the teaching school has done something about their relationship. They even talked to the coworker to resign. I want to know if it’s right and I want to further investigate this evidence.
13839	425	8	108	en-US	Defendant, is there any evidence you want us to help investigate for you? Considering your master program has already finished on May 2017, you have no reason to keep sending text messages to your coworker Huang Rong’er for assignment. And the conversations start usually at 9 pm. This is really suspicious. Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
13840	425	8	109	zh-TW	我沒有任何的證據作為進一步的調查，我和同事之間的短信互動實際上非常簡單，就是我想提升我的語言能力，精進我的中文。
13841	425	8	110	en-US	The next proceeding starts at 4:30 pm on June 24th, 2018. Both the accuser and the defendant shall be present. If required, both parties can have a lawyer, do you understand?
13842	425	8	111	en-US	I understand.

13864	428	9	27	en-US	The incident happened at 7:50 p.m. on July 18th 2020 in the door of the defendant’s house.

You must understand that trust is the basement of marriage. You must understand the important of it.

14916	80	4	29	zh-TW	我記得我的飛機是12月5號2013年，我不記得飛機的航班號碼，但是我記得我搭乘的是國泰航空，在早上七點半時起飛。我需要在香港轉機，等候轉機的時間大概是一小時又20分鐘。

14923	80	4	36	en-US	So who gave you this golf bag and where?
14924	80	4	37	zh-TW	是一個名叫肯特的人給我的。我在曼谷遇到他，他僱用我為他工作。我是一個電腦工程師，他請我幫他把袋子帶到台灣，他跟我約在曼谷的肯德基見面。
14925	80	4	38	en-US	Who gave you this golf bag and told you to bring it to Taiwan? Did you know him? Did you know his name?

14927	80	4	40	en-US	Is Kent his surname or given name? Is it his real name?
14928	80	4	41	zh-TW	我想這是他的真名，但我不知道他姓什麼。
14929	80	4	42	en-US	Where did he give you the gold bag?
14930	80	4	43	zh-TW	他只跟我說我們在曼谷的一家肯德基碰面
14931	80	4	44	en-US	Why did you want to take the golf bag to Taiwan for him?
14932	80	4	45	zh-TW	他說他要付我1000塊美元，如果我幫他把高爾夫球袋帶到台灣的話，我想要賺錢，所以覺得這是個不錯的差事。
14933	80	4	46	en-US	Did you say that he asked to pay you 1000 US dollars as monetary compensation and you have to take the gold bag to Taiwan for him? Is that right?
14934	80	4	47	zh-TW	對啊，他說我只要把高爾夫球袋帶到台灣就可以了，其他事都不用做。
14935	80	4	48	en-US	Did he ever tell you that when you arrive at Taiwan what will happen? What do you have to do next? I mean, will there be anyone to get into contact with you?
14936	80	4	49	zh-TW	肯特告訴我，就待在某間飯店裡，會有人打電話跟我接洽，手機是他給我的。
14937	80	4	50	en-US	Is this cell phone you just mentioned the one that the police officer found at Taoyuan International Airport? I mean is this the confiscated cell phone?
14938	80	4	51	zh-TW	對，就是那隻nokia的手機。
14939	80	4	52	en-US	Now, here I’m going to show you the evidence one. Please the defendant confirm that is this cell phone you just mentioned?
14940	80	4	53	zh-TW	對，這就是肯特給我的那支手機。
14941	80	4	54	en-US	Is this cell phone your personal belonging?
14942	80	4	55	zh-TW	不，這不是我的手機。這是肯特給我的，他把sim 卡裝在裡面，然後給了我。
14943	80	4	56	en-US	Did you mean that this cell phone was given by the one that gave you the golf bag?
14944	80	4	57	zh-TW	對，他在肯德基給我的…
14945	80	4	58	en-US	On which day did he give you the cell phone? In addition to the cell phone, did he give you any other things else?
14946	80	4	59	zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷前一天給我那支手機的，除了手機，他還給我400美金供我吃住。
14947	80	4	60	en-US	So what is his intention to give you this cell phone?
14948	80	4	61	zh-TW	他告訴我他會用這支手機連絡我，還有那個要跟我拿包包的人也會用這支手機跟我聯絡
14949	80	4	62	en-US	which means that when you took this cell phone into Taiwan, someone will call you, meet you up and take the golf bag?
14950	80	4	63	zh-TW	對，肯特跟我說當我到台灣的時候，就會有人打電話給我跟我拿高爾夫球袋
14951	80	4	64	en-US	Do you know that who will get into contact with you?
14952	80	4	65	zh-TW	不，我不知道誰會打給我
14953	80	4	66	en-US	You just answered that the one gave you the cell phone will also give you 400 US dollars. Will this count as monetary compensation?
14954	80	4	67	zh-TW	我想這筆錢應該就是提供我吃住吧
14955	80	4	68	en-US	so besides these 400 dollars, when you get back to Thailand successfully, you will get another 1000 US dollars. Is that right?
14956	80	4	69	zh-TW	對我是這麼想的。在我把高爾夫球袋給指定的人之後，可以回到泰國，並且拿到1000塊美金。
14957	80	4	70	en-US	So when you accepted this case, did you know that what you brought is actually heroine? 
14958	80	4	71	zh-TW	不不不不不，我根本就不知道裡面是海洛因
14959	80	4	72	en-US	don’t you think that if he just wants you to bring gold into Taiwan, this price, I mean 1000 US dollars is a bit too high?
14960	80	4	73	zh-TW	我不管他給我多少錢，我只是想要賺錢而已
14961	80	4	74	en-US	 Have you ever thought about why didn’t the person just bring the gold by himself?
14962	80	4	75	zh-TW	肯特只是告訴我他很忙，他需要有人幫他
14963	80	4	76	en-US	even though you know that in the golf bag was actually gold, you should have known that bringing gold into Taiwan it may be against the law, isn’t it?
14964	80	4	77	zh-TW	我只知道黃金在泰國的確是比較便宜，但我不知道戴黃金進入台灣是不是違法的
14965	80	4	78	en-US	Why do you think that bringing gold into Taiwan won’t have any problem?
14966	80	4	79	zh-TW	黃金就是黃金，應該沒什麼大問題吧，不是嗎?
14967	80	4	80	en-US	When you took the bag, did you check what is inside?
14968	80	4	81	zh-TW	我沒有查，因為袋子封起來了，我不覺得我應該打開它
14969	80	4	82	en-US	You trusted him so deeply, didn’t you think that you might be conned?
14970	80	4	83	zh-TW	我和肯特是在三月見面的，所以我們可能成為夥伴啊，之後可能還需要替他工作呢。我覺得他看起來人蠻好的，我不覺得他會騙我啊
14971	80	4	84	en-US	so do you mean that he said that he wanted to cooperate with you so that’s why you didn’t suspect him, right?
14972	80	4	85	zh-TW	對，我覺得我們之後會一起工作，所以我才這麼信任他
14973	80	4	86	en-US	in addition to the questions you had answered, do you have any other thing to add? Do you have anything that want the court to further investigate?
14974	80	4	87	zh-TW	我真的對這件事情深感懊悔，我真的不知道袋子裡有什麼。我只知道裡面是黃金，如果我知道裡面裝的是海洛因，我就不會把他帶到台灣了，請你原諒我
14975	80	4	88	en-US	So besides Kent, do you have any other concrete or more helpful evidence to help the police to find the one who asked you for this job? 
14976	80	4	89	zh-TW	我只有他給我的那支手機
14977	80	4	90	en-US	Now you are in detention, do you have anyone that you want us to notify for you?
14978	80	4	91	zh-TW	你可以幫我聯絡我在曼谷的家人嗎? 還有我在英國的孩子們。他們現在一定很擔心我，我本來預計在十二月底時會到曼谷的

15006	225	3	29	en-US	Today we are here for the custody…to the preparatory procedure of the custody case of Mr. Johnson and Mrs. Shih. Do both parties have legal assistances?
15007	225	3	30	en-US	Yes, I have a lawyer.
15008	225	3	31	zh-TW	我也有律師。
15009	225	3	32	en-US	Today what I mainly want to do is to understand what is your standpoint on your child custody, and I would also like to know why you think you are the more appropriate one to rear the child. Please focus on this point and elaborate. In addition, I know you are also filing for a divorce case, so I hope that won’t make any verbal attack each other. Is that OK with you?
15010	225	3	33	zh-TW	我知道了。
15011	225	3	34	en-US	OK, I understand.
15012	225	3	35	en-US	First, I would like to ask the plaintiff some questions. Why would you like to…why would you like your child’s custody? As far as I am concerned, now in Taiwan you don’t have a full-time job. You are a foreigner. On the matter of child custody, why do you think you are the more appropriate person?
15013	225	3	36	zh-TW	我主要…我想要就是全部的小孩撫養權有兩個原因。首先，我的太太沒有再跟我們一起住了，我想要在那裡看我女兒長大，而且我聽說我太太跟另外一個男人住在一起。如果是那樣子的話，我懷疑她到底能不能給我們的小孩最好的照顧。因此，我希望有全部的撫養權。
15014	225	3	37	en-US	What you mean is that although your wife is still going on a divorce case with you, she no longer lives with you, and you also doubt that she lives with another man. So…because of the…based on the above reasons, you don’t want the child to be raised by her, is that right?
15015	225	3	38	zh-TW	對，這是我主要的顧慮。
15016	225	3	39	en-US	As to your financial status, that is to say, if you don’t have a full-time job, how are you going to raise your child…your daughter?
15017	225	3	40	zh-TW	我現在確實是沒有全職的工作，但是我有幾個…幾個工作，收入也很固定。這個固定收入可以讓我照顧我自己跟我的女兒。
15018	225	3	41	en-US	You just said that you have several part-time jobs. Because all of them are part-time jobs, can you estimate how much income you have each month?
15019	225	3	42	zh-TW	我平均來說有四到五份兼職工作，全部加起來的話，每個月大概有五萬多塊台幣，如果我有其他額外的工作的話，收入可能會更多。
15020	225	3	43	en-US	Another thing I want to ask is that, is it possible that after you get your child’s custody, you will take her to Canada and not coming back? The reason I ask is that although you get your custody, your wife still have the visitation right, and she can regularly visit your daughter. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, you will be indirectly cutting the tie between them…between your wife and your daughter. So…about this, what is your opinion?
15021	225	3	44	zh-TW	我在台灣已經待五年了。我有居留證，而且我蠻喜歡…我很喜歡這裡。我目前沒有離開台灣的打算，而且我覺得小孩有權利見他的父母。我想說的是，就算我現在要跟我老婆離婚，我沒有打算要切斷我女兒和我老婆的聯繫。在打離婚官司的期間，我…就是定期會傳女兒的照片給老婆看。我甚至還會…就是安排一起出去玩，讓老婆也可以看看小孩。
15022	225	3	45	en-US	So what you’re saying that so far you don’t have a plan…to go back to Canada, right?
15023	225	3	46	zh-TW	對，我有可能會回去，但只是因為我媽年紀大了或生病之類的，但是就算我回去，我也不會待太久。我根本就不會想要把女兒一起帶去。
15024	225	3	47	en-US	Now I would like to ask the other party some questions. Do you no longer live with your husband now?
15025	225	3	48	en-US	Yes, we have been separated for six months.
15026	225	3	49	en-US	When did you…when did you file your divorce case?
15027	225	3	50	en-US	About two months ago.
15028	225	3	51	en-US	That is to say, before you filed your divorce case, you longer live together, right?
15029	225	3	52	en-US	Yes.
15030	225	3	53	en-US	So who do you live with now?
15031	225	3	54	en-US	I live with my son, who is the child of my first marriage.
15032	225	3	55	en-US	First marriage? So…this time…
15033	225	3	56	en-US	He is my second husband.
15034	225	3	57	en-US	So the custody we’re not talking about is…with your husband and is a daughter…your daughter.
15035	225	3	58	en-US	Yes.
15036	225	3	59	en-US	So how old is your son? How old is your daughter.
15037	225	3	60	en-US	My son is seven years old, and my daughter is five months old…eight months old.
15038	225	3	61	en-US	When you are…separate with your husband, is your daughter with you or with your husband…was.
15039	225	3	62	en-US	When…because at that time my daughter was only two months old, she needed my care, so I took her with me.
15040	225	3	63	en-US	So where is…where is the child now? Is she with you or with your husband?
15041	225	3	64	en-US	Now my daughter is with my husband.
15042	225	3	65	en-US	Did you have some sort of negotiation before? Why is your…why was her with you a few months ago, and now she is with your husband.
15043	225	3	66	en-US	After I moved out, my house was smaller. The one I lived with my husband is bigger. Because the environment is better, I sent my daughter to my husband.
15044	225	3	67	en-US	So…if the objective circumstances are not changed...your living place, the environment is still better for your daughter, right? So why do you want your child’s custody, then?
15045	225	3	68	en-US	She is my daughter who I spent ten months bearing…ten months…how would I bear not seeing her? And my husband is Canadian. He’s work in Taiwan is not very stable. He will possibly go back to Canada at any time. In that case, I wouldn’t see my daughter anymore, right? So I would like to…so I would like to have my daughter’s custody.
15046	225	3	69	en-US	Based on your financial status…can you…can you tell us how you are going to rear your child?
15047	225	3	70	en-US	Now we are still going on the divorce case. I hope that now we can let our daughter live in my husband’s house now. Based…in concerned of the environment, the house is better for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have give…I have gave…I have given the court my asset list. In addition, I also have a full-time job, I income every month is 40,000 dollars. I think I am capable of raising my daughter.
15048	225	3	71	en-US	How is your divorce case going on now? Do you know when…when…when we will see the result, or about when we will see the result of the divorce case?
15049	225	3	72	en-US	I’m not quite sure. We will go on the court for the divorce case on this Friday again. I hope that I can tell the judge of the divorce case that the sentence be granted as soon as possible.
15050	225	3	73	en-US	Maybe…we will ask a social worker to regularly visit the plaintiff and the other party and make some evaluation based on seeing your relationship between you and your daughter. The court will…will take reference of their reports and see which party is better of raising the child. Before that, I would like to ask if you both…are you willing to have shared custody? That means that your daughter will be living with husband…with her father for a while and with her mother for another time.

15052	225	3	75	en-US	On this issue, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small for…to young for shared custody...to be raising by shared custody…to be raised custody.
15053	225	3	76	en-US	So, if that is the case, we will arrange for social worker’s visit. After we read their reports, we will arrange our next trial to let both of you state your standpoint. Is that OK with you?
15054	225	3	77	zh-TW	嗯，我覺得社工探視可以。
15055	225	3	78	en-US	I don’t have any questions…It’s also OK with you…with me.
