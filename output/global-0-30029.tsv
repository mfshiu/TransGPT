Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The incident happened on May 22nd, 2014, and the defendant, Mr. Anderson, took the umbrella of Ms.陳小倩, and the incident happened in Yingge Ceramics Museum.

Please explain regarding my questions to help the prosecutor what happened on that day. Do you understand? And later, we will ask the plaintiff about what happened on that day. Do you understand the procedure?

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
And first, the defendant, where were you at 4:15 in the afternoon on May 27th, 2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen, on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see Ms. Chen, the plaintiff, on that day?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，我把傘放回傘架時，有看到陳小姐。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我看到陳小姐' instead of '有看到陳小姐'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
 And what happened then on that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'What happened then on that time?'

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大叫，說我偷了她的雨傘。我想要告訴她，我只是拿到錯的傘。我並沒有想要偷她的傘，我想要解釋，但她根本不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我只是拿到錯的傘' is incorrect. It should be '我只是拿錯了傘'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Ms. Chen think that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟同學一起去博物館看一個展覽。當我們看完展覽，有兩位同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定去外面買東西吃，也許是在外面找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，外面正在下雨。我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟同學借一把傘。因為我有點高，又有點壯，就決定跟我ㄧ個同學Adam借把傘。他的體型跟我差不多。所以我從傘架中拿了一把傘。我跟我的老師，還有幾位同學一起去買麵包。我們回來的時候，陳小姐就看到我，並對我大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '所以我們決定去外面買東西吃' is incorrect. It should be '所以我們決定去外面吃東西'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '看' in the sentence '那天我跟同學一起去博物館看一個展覽' should agree with the subject '我們', so it should be '看了' instead of '看'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '回來' in the sentence '我們回來的時候' should be in the past tense, so it should be '回來了' instead of '回來'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun '我' in the sentence '所以我們決定去外面買東西吃' should be '我們' to match the plural subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the classmates were hungry, which is mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the user planned to borrow an umbrella from their classmates.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the user went to buy bread with their professor and two other friends.
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	The user's translation does not convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness in the sentence '陳小姐就看到我，並對我大叫'. It should be '陳小姐就看到我，並對我大聲喊叫' to reflect the appropriate level of politeness.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed was actually Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '同學' as 'actually'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我以為那把傘是亞當的，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為那把傘是亞當的' instead of '我以為那把傘是亞當的'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
 Do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you took on that day?

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得那把傘的顏色，是藍色的，而且不是全新的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '不是全新的' (not a brand new one) before the color '藍色的' (blue), which is the incorrect word order.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the entire umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的印象中，是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anyone who prove what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，我出博物館的時候，我是跟老師還有兩位同學一起的。我的老師也有提議要借我的傘，因為她的傘有點小，我並沒有拿。我不想要她被淋濕，然後也有兩位同學在旁邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我是跟老師還有兩位同學一起的" is incorrect. It should be "我跟老師還有兩位同學一起出博物館的時候".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "然後也有兩位同學在旁邊" is incorrect. It should be "然後旁邊也有兩位同學".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the professor offered to lend their umbrella.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the reason why the user didn't take the professor's umbrella (to prevent the professor from getting wet).

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Therefore, perhaps, the professor and those two classmates can come to the court to verify what you said is true.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
也許是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any other evidence that you would like to ask the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想要把傘還給陳小姐，但她不想拿；我也試圖想要道歉，但她根本不聽。我的老師跟同學也許可以證實，我說的是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也試圖想要道歉' is incorrect. It should be '我也試圖想要道歉'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '拿' should agree with the subject '她', so it should be '她不想拿'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '證實' should be in the future tense to match the context, so it should be '也許可以證實'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK. Now, I would like to ask Ms. Chen about the detail of the incident on that day.Ms. Chen, could you please elaborate what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day, and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. However, when I came out form the museum, I found that my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff in the museum to help me find the umbrella, but I later saw putting my umbrella back. When I found that the umbrella he took was actually mine, I was actually very angry, and I asked him why he had taken my umbrella. It was raining at that time. How could he do that?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'I was actually very angry' instead of 'I was very angry'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '鶯歌博物館' as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' instead of 'Yingge Museum'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外國人' as 'foreigner' instead of 'this foreigner'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊的傘' as 'my umbrella' instead of 'the umbrella that was stolen'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '沒有公德心' as 'do that' instead of 'lack of civic-mindedness'.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What color was the umbrella you took on that day, and is there any feature of the umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I took on that day should have been blue, dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please show page five on the file one. Is that the umbrella belonging to you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'photo' in the translation, which is an important detail.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'please' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'show'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'belonging' instead of 'is it yours', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is mine.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this photo is common, and people can buy such an umbrella even at a 7-11. How could you verify that is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Actually, I did buy my umbrella at a 7-11. However, the button on my umbrella is a little broken; therefore, it is hard to buckle it up. In terms of this, I have especially talked about it when I made my record at the police station. And the umbrella, which the foreigner put back to the umbrella rack, also had this feature; therefore, it can be proven that the umbrella is mine.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'In terms of this, I have especially talked about it when I made my record at the police station.' The correct word order should be: 'I have especially talked about this when I made my record at the police station.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And the umbrella, which the foreigner put back to the umbrella rack, also had this feature; therefore, it can be proven that the umbrella is mine.' The correct word order should be: 'And the umbrella, which the foreigner put back on the umbrella rack, also had this feature; therefore, it can be proven that the umbrella is mine.'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant regrets and he is willing to apologize, would you like to forgive him? After all, what you missed was an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
It is not about what I missed was an umbrella. It is about one’s personality. If he had not taken the umbrella back on that day, I would be totally wet when I got home on that day. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
 Yes, I understand. And the court will subpoena those three witnesses to the court to testimony what happened on that day. The next court date is set on June 19th, 2014. Is that okay for you on that day, the defendant?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會到庭。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Ms. Chen, you can decide whether to come on the next court date. On the next court date, we will mainly ask the professor and the two fellows on that day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant and the purpose of questioning the classmates and teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'on the next court date' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'come'.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
It doesn’t matter; otherwise, I have to take a leave from my job.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'otherwise' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand, and today’s court is dismissed. And the two parties sign on today’s records, and you may leave.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the instruction for the interpreter to leave after signing the records.

對我覺得那是我同學亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我覺得那是我同學亞當的傘'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
do you remember what’s the shape and color of the umbrella you took on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you remember what the shape and color of the umbrella you took on that day were?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，印象中是藍色的，不是很新
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the item not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
so was the whole umbrella in blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
我印象中是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'blue' as '藍色' which means 'blue color' instead of simply '藍' which means 'blue'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
can anyone verify what you just said?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
對當時我走出博物館的時候，我的兩個同學還有老師都和我在一起。我老師甚至還想要借我雨傘，因為他的傘太小了所以我沒有跟他拿，我不想他被淋濕，還有其他兩位同學在場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '對當時我走出博物館的時候' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當時我走出博物館的時候'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '因為他的傘太小了所以我沒有跟他拿'. The correct form should be '因為他的傘太小了所以我沒有拿'.

semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the detail that the professor's umbrella was small. The correct translation should include this detail.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
These three people can manage to come to the court right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
do you have any further evidence that want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'court' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著想要把傘還給陳小姐，但他不願意；我試著要跟他到道歉，他也不接受。也許我的老師和同學可以證明我所言屬實。

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
 Okay, now I’m going to inquire Mr. Chen what happened on that day. Ms. Chen, can you state what happened on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Ms. Chen, can you state what happened on that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
When I went to the Yingge ceramics museum, it’s raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack. But when I got out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff in the museum to look for my umbrella for me but then I saw that foreigner put my umbrella back. When I found what’s on his hand was my umbrella I was so angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it’s raining outside? How could someone be so…
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part where they asked the museum staff to help them find their umbrella.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'it's' instead of 'it was' to describe the weather.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
what’s the color of the umbrella you brought on that day? Did it have any feature on it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color is the umbrella you brought on that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
 The umbrella I brought that day was blue. I guess navy blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色' as 'navy blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please show the investigatory record on page five. Is the umbrella on the picture yours?

對，就是這把傘。
yes, it was this one.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
the umbrella on the picture was quite normal like the ones you can find in 7-11. How could you be sure that this one belongs to you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的那種' as 'quite normal' instead of 'ordinary type'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, indeed. I bought this umbrella in 7-11. But my umbrella was broken a little bit at the place to close the umbrella. According to this point, I did explain to the police station about the button on the umbrella. The umbrella that the foreigner returned had the same characteristics as the one I had.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'According to this point, I did explain to the police station about the button on the umbrella.' The correct word order should be: 'I did explain to the police station about the button on the umbrella, according to this point.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the umbrella was bought at 7-11. The correct translation should include this detail.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Will you consider to accept the defendant’s apology if he’s willing to apologize to you? After all, it’s only an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
what do you mean “only” an umbrella? It’s something related to one’s basic ethics. If he didn’t return the umbrella on that day, he wants me to walk back in the pouring rain? I don’t want to accept his apology.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'only' instead of 'related to' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'he wants' instead of 'he wants me' which results in a subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'on that day' which is an important detail in the sentence.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The next court day is set at 3pm on June 19th in 2014' is incorrect. It should be 'The next court day is set for 3pm on June 19th, 2014.'

Yes, I will be here.
是，我可以到場
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The plaintiff Ms. Chen, next court you can choose to come or not. Basically we just want to the defendant’s professor and his classmates. You can decide whether you want to come or not.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Basically, we just want the defendant's professor and his classmates.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff's classmates and only mentioned the defendant's professor. The correct translation should include both the classmates and the professor.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
Well, I don’t think so. I don’t want to ask for extra day off.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about needing to ask for leave.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
On May twenty seventh, 2013, Mr. Anderson took Chen Xiao Qian’s umbrella in the Yingge ceramic museum. This incident happened when it is not informed Xiao Qian Chen. When  you tried to returned the umbrella, you were caught by Xiao Qian Chen. Therefore, she filed the case. Today procedure is to investigate what happened that day. Please answer my questions to help the court understand what happened that day.And after that, we’ll ask plaintiff what was happening on that day,do both party understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (took Chen Xiao Qian’s umbrella) should be translated as 借了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (borrowed Chen Xiao Qian’s umbrella)

I understand.
是,我了解

我了解。
Yes I understand

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
So defendant, what are you doing on 4:15 pm, May twenty seven, 2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我那時是在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see plaintiff xiao qian Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see Xiao Qian Chen, the plaintiff?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
對，當我把傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐在那邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐在那邊，當我把傘放回傘架的時候。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對我大吼，然後說我偷了他的雨傘。我試著跟他解釋說，我一定是不小心拿錯的。我並沒有去偷他的傘，我嘗試跟他解釋，但他不肯聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '他對我大吼' is incorrect. It should be '他大吼對我'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' should be translated as 'she' instead of 'he' since the original text refers to a female.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'saying that' which is important for conveying the meaning that she yelled at the speaker.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'I tried to apologize to her' which is important for understanding the speaker's actions.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'but she wouldn’t listen' which is important for understanding the speaker's frustration.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
So why Miss Chen said you steal her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'asked'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館參觀一個展覽。到我們結束參觀的時候，我的兩個同學說他們餓了。所以我們就到外面找食物吃，然後順便找找哪裡可以吃晚餐。當我在博物館裡的時候，我就發現外面正在下大雨了。因為我沒有帶傘，所以我就跟我同學借一把傘。因為我身形有點大，所以我決定從我朋友艾登那邊借了一支傘。他的身形跟我比較像。所以我就從傘架拿走一隻傘。然後我就去買一些麵包給我的教授和我的朋友。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我們大吼。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean that the umbrella you borrowed belong to your friend, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '當時借的傘' as 'the umbrella you borrowed' instead of 'the umbrella you borrowed at that time'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我那個時候是拿艾登的傘，我並沒有意圖想拿別人的傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'Adam' was translated as '艾登' instead of '亞當', resulting in a mismatched meaning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我拿的傘' instead of '我那個時候是拿'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
So do you remember what kind of umbrella you took that day?the color and the shape?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我記得那個顏色，那個顏色是藍色的，而且整支傘看起來沒有很新。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'not a brand new one' as '整支傘看起來沒有很新', which means 'the whole umbrella doesn't look new', but the original text only mentions that it was not brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Was the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
如果我沒記錯的話，那應該整支都是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the entire object was blue, while the original text only mentions the color.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone proved what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'proved' is incorrect, it should be 'prove'.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
對，當我從博物館出來的時候，我的教授和我另外兩個同學可以幫我作證。我的教授甚至要借我他的雨傘。因為他的雨傘有點小，所以我沒有跟他借。我不想要讓他淋濕，況且其他兩個同學都在。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of pronouns
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of professor's gender

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So all of them can come to the court and verified what you said, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著嘗試跟陳小姐解釋說我沒有要偷傘，但是他不肯聽。我也試著跟他道歉但他就是不肯接收。或許我的教授和我兩個同學可以證實我講的話是真的。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	陳小姐 should be translated as Ms. Chen instead of 陳小姐
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 我試著嘗試跟陳小姐解釋說 should be rearranged to 我試著跟陳小姐解釋說
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Ok now I am going to questioning Miss Chen what happened that day.Miss Chen, can you elaborate what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Miss Chen, can you elaborate on what happened that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge ceramic museum that day.When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack.But when I came out, I found my umbrella was disappeared. I asked for the staffs in the museum to help me to find my umbrella.But when I came out the museum, I found a foreigner took my umbrella, and umbrella was in his hand. When I found that my umbrella was taken by that foreigner, I was very angry. So I yelled him, asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t him know that it was raining out there? How can……..

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '質問' as 'yelled' instead of 'asked'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '公德心' as 'politeness' instead of 'public morality'.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Can you tell me what kind of umbrella you brought that day? Is there any feature?Like shape and color?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella you brought that day?'
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the question about the features of the umbrella.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I took that day was blue, deep blue one.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'deep blue one', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '深藍色的' as 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please see the investigate file, is that umbrella in the picture belongs to you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the page number and the fact that it is a photo.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'belongs' instead of 'belong'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
Actually,this kind of umbrella is quite common,you can be bought this kind of umbrella in many convenient stores like 7-11.How can you proved that it is belong to you?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user added unnecessary content by mentioning the availability of the umbrella in 7-11 stores.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I bought that umbrella in a 7-11. But there is a little problem on the button of the umbrella, so it can not be locked. At this point, when I filed the case to police,I have explain for them. The umbrella that foreigner put back have the same feature. So I pretty sure that it was my umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the damage to the button of the umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase 'when I filed the case to police,I have explain for them.' The correct word order should be 'when I filed the case to the police, I explained it to them.'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If defendant apologize,and want to reconcile…settle…..with him..
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the stolen umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'settle' before the subject 'defendant', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important details of the defendant expressing remorse and willingness to apologize.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it just an umbrella? It’s not only about an umbrella, it’s about…If him didn’t put back the umbrella, I may have to go back home without umbrella, and it’s raining. I don’t want to forgive hime.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '只是一把傘' is translated as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'it's not only about an umbrella'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error. 'If him didn’t put back the umbrella' should be 'If he didn't put back the umbrella'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the speaker may have to go back home without an umbrella if it is not returned.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Okay, I understand. So we will subpoena all of the three witness and defendant to the court.The next court will be on 3 pm, June nineteenth, 2014.All of the witness and defendant should have to come to the court. Do you understand, defendant?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'All of the witness and defendant should have to come to the court.' It should be 'All of the witnesses and the defendant should have to come to the court.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence 'The next court will be on 3 pm, June nineteenth, 2014.' It should be 'The next court will be at 3 pm on June nineteenth, 2014.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of sending subpoenas to the three individuals mentioned by the defendant.

Yes, I will be here.
是，我會準時到場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiss, Ms. Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see Ms. Chen, the plaintiff?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有,當我把散放回去的時候,他在那邊

What happened then?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對我大吼大叫說我偷他的傘,我試著跟她說我拿錯了 我並沒有偷傘 我試著跟他道歉 但是她不肯聽

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'would' instead of 'did' in the question.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟我朋友去那邊看展,當我們看完的時候 我兩個同學說他們餓了 所以我們就決定去買點東西吃 找地方吃晚餐 當我離開博物館的時候 發現外面下雨了 我沒有帶傘 所以我就打算跟我朋友亞當借傘 我身形比較巨大 他的身形跟我的比較像 所以我打算跟他借傘 我跟我教授還有兩個同學去買麵包 我們回來的時候 陳小姐就開始對我大吼
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'exhibition' is translated as '那邊看展', which does not accurately convey the meaning of visiting a museum for an exhibition.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean the umbrella you borrow was your friend, Adam’s umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning by using 'borrow' instead of 'lend'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對 我以為那是亞當的傘 我並沒有想偷傘
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為那是亞當的傘' instead of '對 我以為那是亞當的傘'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the umbrella you took that day, what’s the color and shape?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you remember what color and shape the umbrella you took that day was?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色 是藍色的 傘不新

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
The whole umbrella was blue?

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有 我是跟我教授還有兩個同學一起去出博物館的 我的教授甚至說要借我傘 但是因為他的傘很小 我就沒有跟她借 我不想讓她淋濕 還有其他兩個同學也在那

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three people you mentioned can come to the court to verify your words, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I guess so.
我想應該可以

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著要把傘回給她 但是她不拿  我試著跟他道歉 她也不聽 我想我的教授跟兩個同學可以證明我說的是真的
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我試著跟他道歉' should be '我試著跟她道歉'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Incorrect pronoun usage in the sentence '我想我的教授跟兩個同學可以證明我說的是真的' should be '我想我的教授和我的朋友們可以證明我今天所說的是真的'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Okay, now I am going to ask Ms. Chen the situation that day.  Ms. Chen, can you tell me what happened that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yinge ceramics museum that day, and it was raining. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack out there. When I came out, my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff of the museum to find the umbrella for me, and then I found out that the foreigner took my umbrella. When I found out that the umbrella he took was my missing one, I was really angry and inquired him for the reason. Didn’t he know it was raining out there? How could he do that?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out critical context

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Can you tell me what’s the color of the umbrella you took that day? Is there any characteristic?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought was blue, I think it’s dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the investigatory evidence of page five. Can you tell me the umbrella in the picture, is that yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it’s mine.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is a really normal one, which you can buy at 7-11 everywhere. How can you be sure that was yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '那種' as 'everywhere' instead of 'that kind'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought that umbrella at 7-11. But the button of my umbrella was a little bit broken, so it couldn’t be buckled up. I explained this to the police when I called them. The one the foreigner put back had the same situation, from this, I could tell that was my umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they explained the broken button to the police when they reported the case.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If he is regretful and willing to apologize, is it possible that you could forgive him? After all, it’s just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by “just an umbrella?” it’s about a person’s virtue. If he didn’t take back that day, didn’t I have to go home in the rain? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'just a matter of an umbrella.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'If he didn't return it that day, do I have to go home in the rain?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the person not returning the umbrella, which is important for understanding the context.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. Then we will subpoena the three people the defendant mentioned and ask them to tell the situation that day. The next court date is at 3 pm on June 19th in 2014, and the defendant and the three witnesses have to come to the court. Defendant, is the time okay for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I will be here.
是的我會到
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Ms. Chen, you can choose to attend the next court or not. Basically we are going to inquiry some questions to the defendant’s classmates and professor. But if you want to come, it’s okay.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the plaintiff is being addressed.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'inquiry' instead of 'ask' or 'question'.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, I would have to take a day off.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. Then today’s court ends here. Please sign on the record before you leave.

So they three can prove that what you just told is true, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'can' should agree with the plural subject 'they'.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
 Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
 我試著想把傘還給陳小姐但她不拿 我也試著想要道歉但她也不接受 或許我的教授和同學能證明我剛剛說的都是真的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著想把傘還給陳小姐" is incorrect. It should be "我試著想把傘還給陳小姐".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我也試著想要道歉但她也不接受" is incorrect. It should be "我也試著想要道歉但她也不接受".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
 Okay, now I’m going to ask Miss Chen what happened that day. Miss Chen, can you tell me what happened that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and it was raining. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella into the umbrella rack. When I was out, I noticed that my umbrella was gone. I ask the museum to help me find my umbrella then I saw the foreigner put my umbrella back. It was the umbrella I lost. I was so angry that I ask him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he notice that was raining outside? Why he was so lack of morality?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they asked the museum staff for help in finding their umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '鶯歌博物館' as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' instead of 'Yingge Museum'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'I ask' instead of 'I asked' to indicate past tense.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The user used 'he' instead of 'they' to refer to the foreigner.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user did not mention the specific cultural reference of '鶯歌' (Yingge), which is a famous ceramics town in Taiwan.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Can you tell me what color you brought that day? Any specific charateristics?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella you brought that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought was blue, deep blue, I think.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'deep blue, I think', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '應該是深藍色的' (should be deep blue).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
The evidence one, picture on page five. Is that your umbrella in the picture?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '提示偵卷' as 'evidence one' instead of 'examination paper'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'Is' before the subject 'that your umbrella'. The correct word order should be 'Is that your umbrella'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is mine.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
 The umbrella in the picture is common in 7-11. Why can you sure that was your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought my umbrella at 7-11. But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella. Also I told the police as the explanation. The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I was sure that was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella.' The correct word order should be 'But there is some damage/breakage at the button, so I can recognize that it was my umbrella.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I was sure that was my umbrella.' The correct form should be 'The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I am/was sure that it was my umbrella.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Incorrect word choice in the sentence: 'But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella.' The correct word should be 'damage' or 'breakage' instead of 'broke' to convey the intended meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence: 'But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella.' The user did not mention the specific details of the damage or breakage on the button of the umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence: 'Also I told the police as the explanation.' The user did not mention what explanation they provided to the police.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence: 'The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I was sure that was my umbrella.' The user did not mention what specific feature they were referring to.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
So can you tell me if he is regret and willing to apologize, is there any possible to forgive him? Because it is just an umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is there any possible to forgive him?' instead of 'Can you tell me if he is regret and willing to apologize, is there any possible to forgive him?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks if the speaker would be able to forgive the person if they show regret and are willing to apologize, while the user's translation asks if the speaker is able to forgive the person because it is just an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
 What do you mean “it is just an umbrella?” It is about morality issue. If he didn’t put back the umbrella, should I have to get wet home? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just' instead of 'mean' or 'about'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'should' instead of 'have to' in the conditional sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '一把傘' in the translation.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
 Okay, I understand. We will subpoena to the three people that defendant just mentioned to clarify what defendant said is true or not. The next court date will be set at 3 PM, June 19th, 2014. Defendant and the other three people should show up. Defendant, is that fine with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Defendant and the other three people should show up.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of sending subpoenas to the three individuals.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the purpose of the court appearance, which is to explain the events of the day in question.

Defendant, at 4:15 p.m. on May 27th 2014, where was you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'Where were you?' instead of 'Where was you?'

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see Miss Chen?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有阿，當我把傘放回傘價的時候。她就在那了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我把傘放回傘架的時候'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the specific time frame mentioned in the original text.

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對我大叫說我偷了他的傘。我試著要告訴他我拿錯把了，我沒有偷他的傘。可是他根本不聽我說。

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of the speaker trying to apologize to the person.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why Miss Chen still insist that you steal her umbrella?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'still' before 'Miss Chen' instead of after
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'insist' in the translation

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟我跟我同學去博物館看展覽。當我們看完的時候，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定去外面找地方吃東西。可是當我們要離開的時候，外面在下雨。我沒有帶傘，所以想跟我同學借把傘。但是我很高又很壯，我決定跟我朋友亞當借傘。她的身形跟我很像。所以我從傘架上拿了他的傘。我跟教授一起去買一些麵包。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大吼大叫。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using '她' (she) instead of '他' (he) to refer to Adam
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	using '我跟我' (I and I) instead of '我和我的' (my classmates and I)

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed on that day is Adan’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '亞當' as 'Adan' instead of 'Adam'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對阿，那把傘是亞當的。我根本沒有想要偷別人的傘。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'belonged' should agree with the subject 'umbrella', so it should be 'belonged' instead of 'belong'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember the umbrella’s color and type?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，是藍色的而且不是很新的傘。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of an umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjective '藍色的' (blue) before the noun '傘' (umbrella), which is the opposite of the correct word order in Chinese.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Was the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我認知裡面，它是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'recollection' is translated as '認知' which means 'cognition' or 'perception' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory' or 'remembrance'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anyone can prove that you are innocent?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有阿，當我到博物館時，我的兩個同學跟教授都跟我在一起。我教授甚至要借我他的傘，但是因為它的傘太小了，我就沒拿了。我不想要教授淋濕。我其他兩個同學也在那。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "有阿，當我到博物館時" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "當我到博物館時，有阿".

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I guess so.
應該是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著想要把傘環給陳小姐。可是他不接受，我想跟他道歉，它也不聽。我的兩個朋友跟教授可以證明我說的話是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我試著想要把傘環給陳小姐'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'today' in the sentence '我的兩個朋友跟教授可以證明我說的話是真的'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Now I am going to ask Miss Chen some details of that day. Miss Chen, can you deliberate what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
when I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum, it was raining. I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack when I went into the museum.

I was so angry and I ask him why he took my umbrella? Didn’t you know there is raining outside?............
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part where the umbrella was found and returned by the foreigner.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'gave' instead of 'took' in the sentence 'and then I saw the foreigner gave the umbrella back to the rack.'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What’s the color of the umbrella which you brought at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check page5. Is the umbrella on the pictures yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on that picture is common which you can buy in any convenient store. How can you make sure that it is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
I bought the umbrella in convenient store. But the button on the umbrella is broken, and it can’t buckle up. I have told the detail to the police when I sue the case. The umbrella the foreigner gave back has the same character. It is my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'I have told the detail to the police when I sue the case.' It should be 'I have told the police the detail when I sued the case.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'sue the case' is not appropriate in this context. It should be 'report the case' or 'file a complaint'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the umbrella being bought at 7-11, which is an important detail in the original text.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it is just an umbrella? …………………………………. If he didn’t give back the umbrella to me, did he want me to go home when it’s raining?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '只是一把傘' is translated as 'it is just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean that it is just an umbrella?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The phrase 'did he want me to go home when it’s raining?' should be 'did he want me to go home when it’s raining?'

Ok, first, defendant, where are you at four fifteen p.m. May 27th, 2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the defendant, Miss Chen, at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有，當我把傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐就在那。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐就在那，當我把傘放回傘架的時候。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
So what happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對著我大喊，說我偷了她的雨傘。我試著跟她講說我只是拿錯了，我沒有偷她的傘，我試著跟她解釋，但她卻不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著跟她講說我只是拿錯了' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試著跟她說我只是拿錯了'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
But why Ms.Chen said that you steal her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'say'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Ms. Chen' after the verb 'said' instead of before
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'that' before 'you steal her umbrella'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我和一些同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看一個展覽。我們看完展後，兩個同學說他們肚子很餓。所以我們決定出去走走並且吃飯，再找找可以吃晚餐的地方。當我要離開博物館時，我發現在下雨了。我沒有帶傘所以我想要和我同學借傘。因為我比較高也比較壯，所以我決定要和我的同學艾登借傘，因為他的體型和我比較類似。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，然後和我的教授和同學去買麵包。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就對著我們大喊了。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean the umbrella that you borrow is your friend, Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '同學' as 'friend' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對啊，我以為我拿的傘是艾登的，我沒有要偷別人的傘的意思。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember what color is the umbrella you took on that day? Or what kind of shape it is?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色是藍色的，而且樣式也比較舊。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the style of the item being described.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
So the whole umbrella is blue in your memory?

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我記憶中，的確是藍色的。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anybody prove what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有啊，當我回到博物館時，我的教授和同學都跟我在一起，我的教授甚至提議說要借她的雨傘給我，但是因為她的傘比較小，所以我就沒有跟她借，我不想讓她淋濕，而另外兩個同學也是一樣的情況。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '有啊' should be '啊有'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three people can come to the court and prove what you said, can they?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想應該可以吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
So is there any evidence you want the court to help you investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想把傘還給陳小姐，但她不想拿，我也試著跟她解釋，但是她不想聽，也許我的教授和同學都能來這幫我作證，證明我說的話是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也試著跟她解釋' is incorrect. It should be '我也試著跟她解釋'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement in the sentence '但是她不想聽' is incorrect. It should be '但是她不想聽我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'return' in the sentence '我想把傘還給陳小姐'. It should be '我想把傘還給陳小姐'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'today' in the sentence '證明我說的話是真的'. It should be '證明我說的話是真的'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK, now I want to ask some questions about what happen on that day to Ms.Chen. Ms.Chen, can you explain what happen on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to ceramics museum in Ying ge and that day was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. But when I was about to leave the museum, I found my umbrella was gone. So I ask the staff in the museum help me find my umbrella, then I saw this foreigner took my umbrella. When I noticed that the umbrella hold by the foreigner was mine, I was very angry so I ask him “ Why did you took my umbrella?” Don’t you know that it’s raining heavily outside? How can you not know?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misunderstanding of cultural norms and expectations
omission or addition	omitting important details	failure to mention the confrontation with the foreigner

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
So what color is the umbrella you took on that day? If there any specialty?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color is the umbrella you took on that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella you took on that day was blue, I think it might be dark blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the investigate file one, page five, the photo on the page. Is this umbrella on the photo, is this your umbrella?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s mine.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the photo is very common in Taiwan, it is the umbrella that you can buy at any convenience store. How can you be so sure that this is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the umbrella in the photo is common in Taiwan and can be bought at any convenience store, which may not be the case in other countries.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I buy my umbrella at the 7-11. However, my umbrella might be about to broken so it cannot be…together. About this point, I have explained to the police office on that day. And the umbrella was put back by the foreigner also have these features, from these points, it can be proved that this is my umbrella.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Can I ask you a question? If the plaintiff is regretful and he really wants to apologize to you, can you accept his apologize, after all, this is just an umbrella?

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by saying “just an umbrella”? I think it is a question about where a person have the…..or not. If he did not put it back, I might get wet in the heavy rain. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean by saying 'just an umbrella'?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'I think it is a question about whether a person has basic morals or not.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the person not returning the umbrella, which is an important detail in the context.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'I want them to come here and explain what happened on that day' is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I want them to come here and explain what happened on that day.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The date 'June 19th, 2014' should be in the future tense, as the court hearing is scheduled for a future date. The correct tense should be 'June 19th, 2014, at 3 p.m.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant in the sentence 'The witness and plaintiff have to come here.' The correct translation should be 'The defendant and the three witnesses have to come here.'

Yes, I will be here.
沒問題，我可以到。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Defendant, Ms.Chen, you can come here at next court. Basically, next we will ask question on the day to the three person, I mean the plaintiff’s professor and his classmates. Whether you come here or not are okay.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有。當我把傘放回傘架的時候陳小姐就在那邊了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐就在那邊了，當我把傘放回傘架的時候。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我狂吼，說我偷了她的雨傘。我嘗試告訴她我不小心拿錯了，我並沒有偷她的雨傘。我嘗試向她道歉但她都不理我，她都不想聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我嘗試告訴她我不小心拿錯了' (I tried to tell her I accidentally took the wrong one). The correct word order should be '我嘗試告訴她我不小心拿錯了'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why Miss Chen said you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'asked'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'said' before the subject 'Miss Chen', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟幾個同學去那邊看展覽。當我們參觀完以後我兩個同學說他們肚子餓了， 因此我們就決定出去找一些食物或者找晚餐的地點。 當我離開博物館的時候我發現正在下雨。 我沒有帶雨傘，所以我打算向同學借傘。 因為我有點高壯所以我想向我的同學Adam借雨傘，他的身形跟我差不多，所以我就從傘架拿一把傘。 我嘗試去買一些麵包給我的教授和我的朋友。 當我回來時就正是陳小姐對我吼叫的時候。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of yelling

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You said that the umbrella you borrowed is belonged to Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation incorrectly states that the umbrella belongs to Adam, while the original text does not mention the owner of the umbrella.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我想我借的就是亞當的。而且我沒有偷任何傘的意圖。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'thought' as '想' which means 'think' instead of '以為' which means 'thought'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella which you borrowed on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色。 它是藍色的，而且不是很新的傘。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjective '藍色的' (blue) after the noun '傘' (umbrella), which is incorrect. It should be '藍色的傘' (blue umbrella).

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is that the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
根據我的印象，顏色是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
當然。 當我離開博物館的時候我的教授和我兩個同學都跟著我。 我的教授甚至想借我她的雨傘，但我教授的雨傘很小所以我就沒有拿了。 我不想讓我的教授和其他兩位同學被雨淋濕。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '當我離開博物館的時候我的教授和我兩個同學都跟著我' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我離開博物館的時候，我的教授和我兩個同學都跟著我'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So your classmates and professor can come to the court to prove what you said, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我嘗試要把陳小姐的傘還她，但她不收。 我試著跟她道歉，但她完全不想接受。 也許我的教授跟我的同學可以證實我今天所說的話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著跟她道歉，但她完全不想接受" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我試著跟她道歉，但她完全不想接受".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Ok, now I want to ask Miss Chen what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you tell the details what happened on that day to us?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
It was raining and I went to The Yingge Ceramics Museum. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. After I left the museum， I found my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff of the museum to help me find my umbrella but the foreigner just came back and returned my umbrella. When I found he took my umbrella, I was so angry and asking him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? Who can do such a thing like that?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'the foreigner just came back' instead of 'the foreigner had just come back' to indicate the sequence of events.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user used 'Who can do such a thing like that?' instead of 'Why would someone do such a thing?' which is a more natural expression in English.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What the color and the shape of your umbrella which you took on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color and shape was your umbrella that you took on that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
I took a blue umbrella, is deep blue on that day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '藍色的' as 'blue' instead of 'deep blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the picture of the, page five. Is that the umbrella belonged to you?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it was my umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '對' as 'yes' instead of 'it'.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is a kind of common umbrella which can be bought easily in convenient store. How can you be sure that this umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I bought my umbrella in the convenient store. However, the button of my umbrella was broken. I can’t close my umbrella. When I tell the police, I mentioned this point to them. The umbrella which was returned by the foreigner has the same feature so I’m sure that he took my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'When I tell the police, I mentioned this point to them.' It should be 'When I told the police, I mentioned this point to them.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '由此可知' as 'so I'm sure'. The correct translation is 'thus it can be known' or 'therefore it can be inferred'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
I want to ask you a question. If the defendant regrets and he wants to apologize to you can you forgive him and reach a settlement with him because it’s just an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? This is about the basic moral of people. If he didn’t return my umbrella, maybe I needed to walk in the rain to home. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'it's just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean it's just an umbrella?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'What do you mean it's just an umbrella?' instead of 'What do you mean it's an umbrella just?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' which means 'if he didn't return it that day'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
The court will subpoena three people who the defendant mentioned: the professor and his two classmates to explain what happened on that day. The court will be set at 3pm on June 19th 2014. The defendant and three witnesses need to come to the court. The defendant are you ok on that time?

Yes, I will be here.
沒問題我可以到庭。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states 'Yes, I will be here,' indicating that the person will be present. However, the user's translation states 'No problem, I can go to court,' which suggests that the person is willing to go to court but does not necessarily imply that they will be physically present.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The plaintiff, Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not. Basically we will ask the professor and the classmates of the defendant. If you want to come to the court, that is ok.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The plaintiff, Miss Chen, can come to the court or not.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important information that the purpose of asking the classmates and professor is to gather information about the day they were together with the defendant.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, it’s not necessary because I need to have a day off if I come to the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about needing to take a day off if they come to court.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
Ok, I understand. So the court ends here. Please leave the court after the both parties sign the record.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
So, did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Wang?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the name of the plaintiff, Ms. Wang.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
的確我有看到，當我試著把傘放到雨架就看到她了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我試著把傘放到雨架時，就看到她了。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '他對我大聲吼' is incorrect. It should be '他大聲對我吼'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'stole' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我和我同學來這邊看一個展覽，當看完這個展覽之後，有兩同學說他們很餓，所以我們就一起出去買點吃的，然後找個地方吃晚餐，當我要準備離開博物館的時候，發現外面在下雨，因為我沒有帶傘，所以想跟其中一個同學借一把傘。因為我人高又魁，所以想跟其中一個叫亞當的同學借傘，我跟他體型比較像。所以就從傘架中拿了一把傘。我買一些麵包給同學和教授，當我回來的時候，就看到陳小姐對我大聲怒喊著。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我和我同學來這邊看一個展覽' is incorrect. It should be '我和我的同學來這邊看一個展覽'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you that the umbrella you borrow is belong to your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我以為我借的那把傘是我同學的，我沒有意思拿別人的傘
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'thought' as '以為' which means 'assume' instead of '認為' which means 'believe'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Can you tell what’s color and shape you took at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得我拿的那把傘是綠色，而且還不是全新的

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
The umbrella is whole blue?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'whole' is not appropriate in this context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Is the umbrella all blue?'

In my recollection, the color was blue.
我印象中好像是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '我印象中', which means 'in my impression'. This does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the adjective '藍色的' (blue), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '藍色的是' (blue is).

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Could anyone prove what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
當出來的時候，我和我教授還有同學一同出來，我教授甚至願意借我傘，但他的傘實在太小，所以我沒跟他借，我不想教授因為我而淋雨，當時我有兩個同學在那。

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著把這把傘還給他，但是他不願意。此外，我想道歉，但他也不願意接受。我想我同學和教授都可以證明我說所說的都是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著把這把傘還給他" is incorrect. It should be "我試著把這把傘還給她" to match the original text.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
Actually, the blue umbrella you claim belongs to you is easy to buy in convenience store, how could you say that this umbrella belongs to you
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the umbrella is easy to buy in a convenience store, instead of stating that it is a common type of umbrella that can be bought in a convenience store.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, my umbrella was bought in convenience store. The lock part of mu umbrella is little broken. I could not lock it up. I report this point when I reported to police. The umbrella which the foreigner took has the same specifics sot that I could say that the umbrella is mine.

 Is it possible that you forgive the defendant? After all, he has the sense of regret.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '妳有沒有可能原諒他呢?' as 'Is it possible that you forgive the defendant?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it was just an umbrella? I think it should be public norm. If he did not return the umbrella to me, I have to come home with big rain? I do not want to forgive him.

No.4 of 5F, No.132 Xie Fu Rd., Sanxia Dist., New Taipei City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
 The incident happened at May 27th, 2014 and the incident is that when the defendant visited the Yingge Museum, he took the plaintiff’s umbrella. This action happened without asking plaintiff’s permission. When the defendant wanted to give back the umbrella, the plaintiff found out this incident. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. Today our procedure is to clarify what happened at that day. Please answer my questions to help the prosecutors to know more about the detail. Later I will ask the plaintiff to know more about the incident. Do both of you understand this procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the date as 'May 27th, 2014' instead of 'May 27th, 103'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the defendant took the umbrella without the plaintiff's permission.

I understand.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you at 4:15 p.m. May 27th, 2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff at that day?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'see' should be in the past tense to agree with the past time frame.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
當我想把傘放回傘架的時候我有看到陳小姐。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我把傘放回傘架的時候，我看到了陳小姐。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大吼大叫，還說我偷了她的傘。我想要跟她說我只是拿錯傘了。我並沒有偷傘，我嘗試向她道歉但她並不接受。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我想要跟她說我只是拿錯傘了' is incorrect. It should be '我想要跟她說我只是拿錯了傘。'

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why would the plaintiff say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'the plaintiff' instead of 'Miss Chen'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'would' instead of 'did' in the question.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
事發當天我和一些同學去看展覽。當我們看完展覽的時候，我有幾個同學說他們肚子餓。因此我們決定走出博物館找些東西吃，甚至是吃晚餐。當我要離開的時候，發現正在下雨。我忘記帶傘了，所以想要和我同學借。因為我長得比較高大，所以我想要跟亞當，我的同學，借傘，他的體型和我比較相近，所以我就從傘架拿了一支傘。我就和我的老師和同學一起去買麵包了。當我們回來的時候就是事發的經過了，陳小姐就開始對我大喊。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You said that the umbrella you took at that time belonged to your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'borrowed' as 'took', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
 對，我以為我當時拿的傘是我同學的，所以我並沒有偷傘的意思。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'belonged to Adam'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember what the shape is the umbrella and what color is?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得它是藍色的，而且不是很新的傘。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjective '藍色的' (blue) before the noun '傘' (umbrella), which is the opposite of the correct word order in Chinese.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的記憶中，應該是藍色的吧。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '應該' (should) is added, changing the meaning of the sentence.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anybody can prove what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
 是的，當我走出博物館的時候，我和老師和同學在一起，我的老師甚至提議要借我傘。但她的傘比較小，所以我並沒有跟她借，因為不想要老師淋溼，然後還有其他兩個同學在，所以就跟別人借。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我和老師和同學在一起' is incorrect. It should be '我和老師和同學一起在一起'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor and classmates were with them when they came out of the museum.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the other two classmates were also present.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user borrowed an umbrella from someone else.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user didn't want the professor to get wet.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Can those three people come to the court as a witness to help you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試圖把傘還她但她不接受，我也試圖跟她道歉，但她一樣不接受。可能我的老師跟同學可以證明我今天所說的都是實話吧。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試圖把傘還她但她不接受" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我試圖把傘還給她但她不接受".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我也試圖跟她道歉，但她一樣不接受" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我也試圖跟她道歉，但她一樣不接受".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
 I’m going to ask some questions to the plaintiff, Ms. Cheng. Ms. Cheng, can you describe what happened at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Ms. Cheng, can you describe what happened that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
 I went to the Yingge Museum and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack at the front door. When I was going to leave, I found out that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff to help me find my umbrella. And at that time, I saw this foreigner came back and put back my umbrella. When I found out that the umbrella he took was mine, I angrily asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining? How could he do that?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they asked the staff for help in finding their umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊' as 'gone' instead of 'stolen'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'was' instead of 'were' in the question 'Didn’t he know that it was raining?'.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user used 'angrily' instead of a more polite expression to convey their emotions.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What was the color of the umbrella which you brought that day? Is there any feature?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella that you brought that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day was blue. Specifically, dark blue.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the detail that the umbrella should be dark blue.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the picture 5 in document 1. Is the umbrella in this picture your umbrella?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture is quite plain. It’s just a normal umbrella that you can buy in a convenient store. How can you confirm this umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker's perspective and replaced it with a general statement.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I just bought it in 7-11. However, my umbrella has a broken park, so I can recognize it. I have explained that to the police when I filed this case at the police station. The umbrella this foreigner put back shared the same feature, so I can say that it is my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the detail about the broken part of the umbrella
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	addition of unnecessary information about filing the case at the police station
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect interpretation of 'park' as 'park' instead of 'button'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant regrets for his behavior and has the will to apologize, would you accept that? After all, the thing you lost is just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
How could you say that it’s just an umbrella? It’s about the moral issue. If he didn’t put back, maybe I had went(gone) home in the heavy room. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	word choice errors	incorrect word choice: 'room' instead of 'rain'
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect verb tense: 'had went' instead of 'had gone'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of details: 'rain' is omitted
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of details: 'home' is omitted
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of details: 'in the heavy rain' is omitted

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
 I understand. We will subpoena those three people the defendant mentioned to the court as witnesses. Next court will be set at 3p.m., on June 19th, 2014. And the defendant and three of the witnesses should show up. Is this time okay for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會出席。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Plaintiff, the next court you may show up or not. Depends on you. Basically, we will ask some questions to the defendant and the witnesses, so if you wouldn’t show up is okay.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No I won’t come. I need to ask for a day off.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. Then, today’s court is adjourned. Please sign the document and you may leave.

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' should be translated as '她' since the person being referred to is a female.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why would Ms. Chien say you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'Ms. Chien' instead of 'Ms. Chen'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the evidence page number five the picture. Is this your umbrella?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes it is.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this photo is very common like the one you could buy in convenient stores. How could you know it was yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes I bought my umbrella at 7-11convenient store but the buckle was a little broken and couldn’t work well.About this point I explained to the police when I sued the case.The umbrella that foreigner put back to the umbrella rack also has that broken part so I know it was mine.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant was sorry and he would like to apologize, could you forgive him? After all it was only an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊的只是一把傘' as 'it was only an umbrella', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text implies that the stolen item was just an umbrella, but the user's translation suggests that the umbrella itself was not important.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it was only an umbrella?It is about …If he didn’t bring it back on that day, was I going to go back in huge rain?  I don’t want to forgive him.

Such incident happened when the defendant didn’t keep the plaintiff… known. When the defendant wanted to return the umbrella, the plaintiff found out immediately, found out right at the moment that the defendant took her umbrella, as a result, she sued the case. We are here to understand what had happened at that day. Please answer what we I ask you, so that the police can understand what had happened at that day, do you understand? I’ll also question the plaintiff, ask her about what had happened at that time, do both parties understand the procedure.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you at 4:15 p.m. on May 27th, 2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我那時候在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff at that time… Miss Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see Miss Chen, the plaintiff, at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
當我把她的傘放到傘架的時候, 我看到她了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我看到她了' instead of '我了看到她'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對我大吼大叫, 說我偷他的雨傘, 我試著告訴他說我一定是拿錯了, 我並沒有偷他的傘, 而且我還跟他道歉但他都不聽
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes cultural transformation by using the pronoun '他' (he) instead of '她' (she) to refer to the person yelling.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has subject-verb agreement errors by using '對我大吼大叫' (yelled at me) instead of '對我大吼' (yelled at me).

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和我一些同學一起到博物館看展覽, 當我們看完展的時候, 有兩個朋友說肚子餓了, 所以我們決定出去外面找找東西吃, 也順便找找晚餐要吃什麼, 當我離開博物館的時候, 我發現下雨了. 我沒有帶傘, 所以我那時候要跟我朋友借, 因為我有點高而且蠻壯的, 所以我就決定跟我一個叫亞當的朋友借跟他借雨傘, 他的體型跟我比較像,所以我從傘架拿了一支傘, 我就跟我的教授和朋友買了麵包, 當我回來的時候就是陳小姐對我大吼大叫的時候了
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning: 'borrow' instead of '借'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order: '我和我一些同學一起到博物館看展覽' should be '我和一些同學一起到博物館看展覽'

omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'When we came back' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me' in the translation

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed is your friend’s, Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '同學' as 'friend' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對我那時候以為那把傘是亞當的, 而且我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為那把傘是亞當的'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color, the size or the shape of the umbrella you took that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色, 是藍色的傘, 而且沒有很新
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'brand new' as '很新', which means 'very new', but the original text does not indicate that the umbrella was very new, just that it was not brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the umbrella blue… wholly?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'wholly' does not accurately convey the meaning of '整隻' which means 'entire' or 'whole'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'Is the umbrella wholly blue?'

In my recollection, the color was blue.
就我記憶所及, 好像都是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '就我記憶所及', which means 'as far as I remember' instead of 'In my recollection'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anyone can testify for you
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有, 當我從博物館走出來的時候, 有一位教授和兩個朋友和我一起, 我的教授當時甚至說她可以借我她的傘, 但她的傘蠻小的所以我就沒有跟她借了, 我不想要我的教授淋濕, 而且我另外兩個朋友也在那裡.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So these three can come to the court and verify for you, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是這樣的

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any other evidence you hope the police to help you to investingate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著要把傘還給陳女士, 但她拒絕了, 我想要跟她道歉但她也不接受, 我想也許我的教授和我的朋友可以證明我今天說的都是真的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence should be '我試著把傘還給陳女士' instead of '我試著要把傘還給陳女士'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Ok, now I’ll question Miss chen about the incident happened at that day. Miss Chen, could you elaborate what had happened at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to the Yingge ceramic museum, and it was raining. When I entered into the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack. When I came out, went out from the museum, I found my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff of the museum of to help me to find my umbrella, and at that time, I found the foreigner took my umbrella and put it back in the rack, When I found that the umbrella he took is mine, I was very angry and I questioned him, why did he take my umbrella? Didn’t he know it’s raining outside, how could he took other’s umbrella away?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'When I came out, went out from the museum'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in 'I found the foreigner took my umbrella'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '失竊的傘' as 'umbrella he took' instead of 'my stolen umbrella'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '外面在下雨' as 'it's raining outside' instead of 'didn't he know it's raining outside'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '沒有公德心' as 'took other's umbrella away' instead of 'lack of common decency'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
The umbrella you brought that day….What’s color is that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
I brought a blue umbrella, I believe it’s more like a navy color.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色' as 'navy color' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the evidence, page no,5, is this umbrella yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, this is my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the photo/ in the picture, is actually that kind which most people can buy from the 7-11, how could you be so confirmed that this umbrella belongs to you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, my umbrella was bought from the 7-11, but the bottom of my umbrella is a little bit broken, out of order, it didn’t work very well, for this point, I’ve already told and explained to the police when I reported the case. The umbrella that the foreigner took and returned had the same problem on the umbrella, so I believe that’s my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the phrase 'out of order, it didn’t work very well'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	the phrase 'out of order' does not accurately convey the meaning of '扣不太起來' which means 'cannot be fastened properly'
omission or addition	omitting important details	the user did not mention the specific location of the damage on the umbrella, which is '在釦子那邊' (at the button)
omission or addition	omitting important details	the user did not mention the specific characteristic of the umbrella that the foreigner returned, which is the same problem with the button
omission or addition	omitting important details	the user did not mention the fact that the umbrella was returned to the umbrella stand by the foreigner

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
May I ask you if the other party, the defendant, want to apologize and is very sorry about this, would you consider to forgive him? Since the thing you lost is just an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by only just an umbrella? It’s the issue about morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, what do you want me to do? Did I need to run in the rain and go home? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '只是' is translated as 'only just' instead of 'just' or 'simply', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'Did I need to run in the rain and go home?', where 'Did' should be 'Do'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand, then we will subpoena the three people the defendant had mentioned and ask them to come to the court and ask them to verify for the case. The next court will be set on 6/19/2014, at 3 p.m., is that okay with you? And in addition, the three witness have to come as well.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The next court will be set on 6/19/2014, at 3 p.m., is that okay with you?' is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Is that okay with you? The next court will be set on 6/19/2014, at 3 p.m.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the defendant and the three witnesses are required to attend the court.

Yes, I will be here.
好的我會到
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '到' is not the correct translation for 'here'.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not to come for the next court. Basically, we will question the professor and the classmates of the defendant, if you want to come, it’s still ok.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, I don’t want to come, if I have to come, I need to take a day off.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'Miss Chen' instead of 'Miss Chen'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
當天我和同學一起去博物館看展覽 我們看完展覽後，我的兩位同學說肚子餓了 因此我們決定出去買點東西來吃，或找個地方吃晚餐 就當我要離開博物館的時候，我看到外面在下雨 我當時沒有帶傘，所以我本來打算和我同學借一把 因為我人比較高大，所以我想要向我的朋友借一把傘，他的名字叫做亞當他的身型和我差不多 所以我就從傘架裡拿了一把傘 然後我就和我的教授和一些朋友去買麵包當我回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大喊

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
 Do you mean that the umbrella you took from the umbrella rack is the umbrella of your friend, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '借' as 'took' instead of 'borrowed'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'umbrella' after the verb 'took' instead of before it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was taken from the umbrella rack.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
 對，我當時就以為那把傘是我朋友亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you still remember the color and the shape of the umbrella you took?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you took?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色是藍色，但看起來並不新
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'not a brand new one' as '但看起來並不新', which means 'but it doesn't look new'. This is a mismatched meaning because the original text does not mention anything about the appearance of the item, only that it is not brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the umbrella all in blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的記憶中，它是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '在我的記憶中', which means 'in my memory', instead of '根據我的回憶', which means 'according to my recollection'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anybody can prove what you say is true?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有，當我從博物館出來的時候，我的教授和我的兩個同學在我身邊 我的教授甚至想要借我她的傘 但是她的傘太小了，所以我並沒有跟她借傘 我並不想要害我的教授淋溼，所以我也沒有跟另外兩位同學借傘

Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Now, I am going to ask Miss Chen about what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you briefly describe what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day. At that time, it was raining.When I entered the museum, I left my umbrella outside the museum.However, when I came out the museum, I found my umbrella missing.I asked the staff of Yingge Ceramics Museum for helping to find my umbrella. At that time, we found this foreigner taking my umbrella.When I found out that my umbrella was on his hand, I was very angry and I asked him why you stole my umbrella?Don’t you know that it is raining? It is really an impolite behavior.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was found and returned by the museum staff.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'steal' instead of 'took'.
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user used the word 'impolite' instead of 'lack of public morality' to describe the foreigner's behavior.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What is the color of the umbrella that you took on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The color of the umbrella is blue, kind of deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'kind of deep blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please see the investigatory file number one on the fifth page. Is this umbrella yours?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the photo in the translation.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on the investigatory file is quite a common type of umbrellas which everybody can buy it on 7-11. How you can say that it is the umbrella that is of yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
That’s true. That’s the umbrella I bought from 7-11.However, there is a problem on the button of my umbrella so it is hard to fold it.When I filed the case against him in the police office, I did mention this point.The umbrella that this foreigner put back into the umbrella rack is also with this special point so I regarded it was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The umbrella that this foreigner put back into the umbrella rack is also with this special point so I regarded it was my umbrella.' The correct word order should be: 'The umbrella that this foreigner put back into the umbrella rack is also with this special point, so I regarded it as my umbrella.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of reporting the case to the police when explaining the damage to the umbrella. The correct translation should include this detail: 'When I filed the case against him in the police office, I did mention this point.'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the other party does have the wiliness to settle this case and apologize, are you willing to accept his apology and settle the case? After all, it is an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions the possibility of forgiveness, while the user's translation focuses on settling the case.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it is just an umbrella? It is about does a person have morality or not.On that day, if he didn’t come back and put back the umbrella, I would go home in all wet.I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just', which does not convey the intended meaning of 'about' or 'related to'.

Defendant, are you fine with this date?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The next court date is set by nineteenth, June, 2014, at three p.m.' is incorrect. It should be 'The next court date is set for June nineteenth, 2014, at three p.m.'

Yes, I will be here.
是
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '是' is translated as 'yes' instead of 'will be'.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, you don’t have to be here on the next court date.Basically, on that day, we will ask some questions to his professor and fellow classmates. If you want to come, it is Okay.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff's presence in court on the next date.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened?

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
當天我跟一些同學去看展覽。看完展覽之後，我有兩個同學說肚子餓了。我們想要出來吃點東西，就是晚餐吧。我要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了。我沒有帶傘所以我想跟同學借一把。因為我人有點高大，所以我原本想跟亞當借傘。他的身形跟我比較像。所以我就從傘架拿一把傘，我跟教授跟朋友去買一些麵包。我回來，陳小姐就對我喊叫。

I went to the Ying-ge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. As I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. However, when I was about to leave the museum, I found the umbrella disappeared. I asked the staff find the umbrella for me. Then I saw this foreigner who is carrying my umbrella. When I found that the umbrella that he was taking was mine, I was furious.

This kind of umbrella can be bought in convenience stores, such as 7-11. How can you make sure that this umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated the sentence by adding unnecessary information about the umbrella being available in convenience stores.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought the umbrella at 7-11. And there’s some damage on the opening part. When I was at the police station, I told th police this point. And the umbrella also had the same trait. So I could say that that umbrella was actually mine.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean not a big deal? It’s about empathy. If he hadnt returned the umbrella, I must have been wet and walked all the way home. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of '只是' as 'not a big deal' instead of 'just' or 'simply'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. So the court will supoena three friends of the defendant and ask them to come to the court to… The next court date will be on June 19th, 2014. Is this date okay with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I will be here.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of specifying the time or duration of being present.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Ms. Chen, you could choose to come to the court. Or if you don’t want to, that is okay. Basicly, we will ask the three supeonas questions. If you want to come, you’re welcome

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the questions will be asked to the classmates and teachers who were present with the defendant on that day.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。

Rm. 4, 5F., No.132, Xuefu Rd., Sanxia Dist., New Taipei City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The time was 5/27 2013. In that time, the defendant took plaintiff’s umbrella in Yingge Ceramics Museum. The plaintiff was unknown with this case. When the defendant took the umbrella back, the plaintiff found what he did. So the plaintiff filed this case. Today’s procedure mainly understand what happened in that day. You have to answer my questions to make the prosecutor understand what happened in that day, do you understand? And I will ask the plaintiff what happened in that day. Do both parties understand this procedure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The time was 5/27 2013' is incorrect. It should be 'The date was 5/27/2013.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '造訪' as 'took' is incorrect. It should be translated as 'visited'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the defendant took the umbrella without informing the plaintiff.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the plaintiff discovered the defendant taking the umbrella back.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the plaintiff filed a case against the defendant.

I understand.
是的，我了解了。

我了解。
Yes, I understand.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, at 4:15 PM on 5/27 2014, where were you in that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時正在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'I' in the translation, which is an important detail.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff, Hsio Chien Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把傘還回傘架的時候，我有看到她。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有看到她' instead of '我看到有她'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened in that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她叫說我偷了她的傘。我試圖告訴她我只是拿錯了傘。我並沒有偷她的傘，我試圖向她道歉，但她還是大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '她叫說我偷了她的傘' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她叫我說我偷了她的傘'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why would Hsio Chien Chen say that you steal her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'Hsio Chien Chen' instead of 'Miss Chen'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'steal' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和同學們去博物館參觀展覽，當我們結束參觀展覽之後我有兩個同學說他們餓了。於是我們決定出去找東西吃，那大概是在晚餐的時間。當我們正要離開的時候，我們發現外面正在下雨。我並沒有帶傘，所以我打算和我的同學借傘。因為我人比較高大，所以我決定跟我的同學借一把比較大的傘。因為他的體型跟我比較像。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，我和一些教授還有我的同學同行。當我回去時，陳小姐就對著我大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '那大概是在晚餐的時間' is incorrect. It should be '那大概是晚餐的時間'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '借' should agree with the subject '我' and be conjugated as '借了' instead of '借'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '跟' should be in the past tense '跟了' to indicate borrowing the umbrella in the past.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after '我從傘架拿了一把傘' to separate the clauses.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean that the umbrella that you took is your friend, Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation incorrectly states that the umbrella was taken, instead of borrowed.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be changed to 'was' to match the past tense of the original text.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
沒錯，我那時候就想說，那把傘是亞當的。我並沒有打算要偷別人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我那時候就想說，那把傘是亞當的。'

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color and shape that umbrella you took?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得那把傘是藍色的，但不是一把新的傘。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the mention of the umbrella at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the past tense 'was' instead of the present tense 'is' to describe the color of the umbrella.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
So is only one color blue for the umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
就我所知，那把傘是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states 'In my recollection, the color was blue,' while the user's translation states 'As far as I know, the umbrella is blue.' The user's translation implies that the information is based on current knowledge, rather than a personal recollection.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Do anyone can verify what you state?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
當然阿，我身邊有一些教授和兩位朋友。我的教授甚至跟我說，要借我一把傘。但是她的傘太小了，不適合我。我不想要她淋濕，我的另外兩外同學也在旁邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我身邊有一些教授和兩位朋友' should be '我身邊有兩位朋友和一些教授'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor and classmates were with the user when they came out from the museum.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor offered to lend their umbrella to the user.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user didn't take the professor's umbrella because it was small and the user didn't want the professor to get wet.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that there were two classmates with the user and the professor.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three people can make it to verify this situation for you, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do any other … you want the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著還陳小姐傘，但她不想理我。我試著向她道歉，但她也不想理我。也許我的教授和我的朋友可以證實我今天所說的話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著向她道歉，但她也不想理我' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試著向她道歉，但她也不想理我'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Now, I am going to ask Ms. Chen what happened in that day. Ms. Chen, could you say what happened in that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
The day I went to Ying ge Ceramics Museum, it was a raining day. When I entered in the Museum, I put my umbrella in my umbrella rack. When I went out, I cannot find my umbrella. I asked the Museum’s officer to help me to look for the umbrella, and I found that the defendant out back my umbrella. When I found that he took my umbrella back, I was angry. And I asked him why he took my umbrella away. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How could he do that? So what’s the color of the umbrella you took in that day?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	defendant instead of foreigner
grammar and structure	word order errors	out back instead of brought back
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the color of the umbrella

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
And is any characteristic of that umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella that I took in that day is blue. Perhaps it’s deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'Perhaps it’s deep blue.' which does not accurately convey the meaning of '應該是深藍色的' (should be deep blue).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now, we are going to show you investigatory file of page5. The umbrella in the photo is yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it’s mine.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the photo is a very common type. Anyone can buy it in the convenient store of 7-11. How could you know it was your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the umbrella is a common type that can be bought at 7-11, instead of asking how the speaker knows it is their umbrella.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought it in 7-11. However, my umbrella’s button was broken, so the button cannot be used. For this point, I explained it when I told to the police. The umbrella that he put back meets this characteristic, so I think it’s my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'For this point, I explained it when I told to the police' is incorrect. It should be 'For this point, I explained it when I told the police.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'meets' should agree with the singular subject 'umbrella'. It should be 'meets' instead of 'meet'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the umbrella being put back on the umbrella stand by the foreigner.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
So would you forgive the defendant if he wants to regret and apologize for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
How can you say that? It’s about the basic moral. If he didn’t put the umbrella back, …. I wouldn’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. We will subpoena three of witness in that day, and we will try to ask them what happened in that day. Defendant, the next court date will set at3:00 P.M. in June 19 2014, and three of witness and you should make it, is that ok with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'We will subpoena three of witness in that day' should be 'We will subpoena three witnesses on that day'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence: 'Defendant, the next court date will set at 3:00 P.M. in June 19 2014' should be 'Defendant, the next court date will be set at 3:00 P.M. on June 19, 2014'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'to court' in the sentence: 'Defendant, the next court date will set at 3:00 P.M. in June 19 2014' should be 'Defendant, the next court date will be set at 3:00 P.M. on June 19, 2014 to court'.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會到庭。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Plaintiff, Ms. Chen, you can make it if you want. We will manly ask the defendant’s classmates and professors, you can make it or not.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the next court hearing.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
I wouldn’t make it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about needing to take leave.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. The court will dismiss here. Please sign the statement and leave the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court session being concluded and the instruction to leave the court after signing the statement.

我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大吼大叫說:「我她了她的雨傘。」我試著告訴他我是拿錯雨傘，我沒有偷她的雨傘，我有試著跟她解釋，但是她一點都不想聽我的解釋。

semantic conversion	omission of details	我有試著跟她解釋
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	我沒有偷她的雨傘

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Can you explain why Ms. Chen stated that you stole her umbrella?

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

那天我和我的同學去博物館看一場展覽。當我們看完展覽的時候，我的兩個同學說他們很餓，所以我們決定離開，去看看有沒有甚麼東西可以吃，所以我們就離開去找餐廳。當我離開博物館時，我發現下雨，我沒有帶傘，所以我打算跟我的同學借一把。因為我的體格比較高，所以我決定跟我的朋友Adam借傘。他和我的體格相近。然後我就雨傘架拿了一把雨傘。然後我打算去買一些麵包給我的教授和朋。當我們回來時，陳小姐看到我就對我大吼大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以我們就離開去找餐廳' (So we left to find a restaurant). The correct word order should be '所以我們就去找餐廳' (So we went to find a restaurant).
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '所以我們決定離開，去看看有沒有甚麼東西可以吃' (So we decided to leave, to see if there is anything to eat). The verb '看看' (to see) should agree with the plural subject '我們' (we), so it should be '所以我們決定離開，去看看有沒有甚麼東西可以吃' (So we decided to leave, to see if there are anything to eat).
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence '所以我打算跟我的同學借一把' (So I planned to borrow one from my classmates). The pronoun '我的同學' (my classmates) should be in the possessive form, so it should be '所以我打算跟我的同學們借一把' (So I planned to borrow one from my classmates).
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing punctuation in the sentence '然後我就雨傘架拿了一把雨傘' (Then I took one umbrella from the rack). There should be a comma after '然後' (Then), so it should be '然後，我就雨傘架拿了一把雨傘' (Then, I took one umbrella from the rack).

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You are saying that the umbrella you borrowed was your classmate’s,Adam’s, umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '同學' as 'classmate' instead of 'classmate's'

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我以為我拿的傘就是亞當的雨傘。我並沒有意圖打算要偷任何人的雨傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'steal' is used in the translation, which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The correct word should be 'take'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you rememer the shape and the colore of the umbrella you took?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得傘是藍色的，而且沒有很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the mention of the color at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the present tense '是' (is) instead of the past tense 'was'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella being 'not a brand new one'.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Was the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的記憶裡，它的顏色是藍色。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can someone prove what you say is truth?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
當我回到博物館時，我的教授和我的兩個朋友當時和我在一起。我的教授甚至本來打算要借我她的雨傘，但是她的雨傘有點小，所以我並沒有接受。我不想要讓教授淋溼，而且我的兩個同學也都在那裏。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '當我回到博物館時' is incorrect. It should be '當我從博物館出來時'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '當時' should agree with the subject '我的教授和我的兩個朋友', so it should be '當時和我在一起' instead of '當時和我在一起'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '打算要借我她的雨傘' is a mismatched meaning. It should be '提議借給我她的雨傘' to convey the meaning of 'offered to lend me her umbrella'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the professor offered to lend the umbrella. This detail is important for understanding the context.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So, the three person, who were with you, might can come to the cour to prove what you say is truth, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Incorrect subject-verb agreement in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'help' in the translation.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you want the court to imvestigate any evidence for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著要把傘還給陳小姐，但她不接受。我也試著跟她道歉，但是她一句話也不想聽我說。或許我的教授跟我的兩個同學可以證明我說的是實話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我也試著跟她道歉，但是她一句話也不想聽我說'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Okay,now I am going to ask Ms. Chen some questions about the detail on that day. Ms. Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
 I went to Ying ge Ceramic museum, and it was rainy. When I entered into the museum, I put my umbrella at the umbrella track. But when I came out, I couldn’t find my umbrella. I asked the staff in the museum to help me find my umbrella, and later I saw this foreigner came back and with my umbrella. When I found out that the umbrella he took was my missing umbrella, I was angry and I asked him: why do you took my umbrella? Don’t you know it was rainy outside? How can you do that without any ethics?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'umbrella track' instead of 'umbrella stand'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	using 'do' instead of 'did' in the question 'why do you took my umbrella?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	not mentioning that the user asked the museum staff for help before finding the umbrella
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	using 'without any ethics' instead of 'without any sense of public morality'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Can you tell me what’s the color of your umbrella and does it have any feature?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color is your umbrella?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The Umbrella I brought that day was blue, I think the color exactly it was deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '應該是深藍色的' as 'I think the color exactly it was deep blue', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the photo on page 5 of investigation file one. Does the umbrella in the photo belong to you?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is my umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '這把傘' as 'my umbrella' instead of 'this umbrella'.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the photo was very common; everyone can get one at the 7-11. How can you sure that the umbrella is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated the sentence by adding unnecessary information about the umbrella being available at 7-11.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
That’s true; I bought my umbrella at the 7-11. But my umbrella has some flaws and it cannot be hold tidily. When I filed the case, I specifically described this feature to the police. The umbrella which was taken by the foreigner has the same feature. So, in other words, that is my umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged and couldn't be closed properly.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'When I filed the case' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '扣不太起來' as 'it cannot be hold tidily' instead of 'it cannot be closed properly'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '特徵' as 'feature' instead of 'characteristic'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '由此可知' as 'So, in other words' instead of 'From this, it can be known'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant would like to apologize and show his regret, would you consider to settle the case with him?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Would you consider settling the case with him if the defendant would like to apologize and show his regret?'

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it is just an umbrella? It is about ethics. If he did not put my umbrella back, did you mean that I need to go home in such rain? I do not want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是' as 'just' instead of 'mean' or 'about'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'put' before the noun 'umbrella' in the sentence 'If he did not put my umbrella back'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '拿來還' which means 'return it' in the sentence 'If he did not put my umbrella back'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
 I understand. Then we will subpoena the three person who was mentioned by the defendant to describe what happened on that day. The next court date will be on July 19th, 2014. Defendant and three witness will be show up, are you okay with this arrangement, defendant?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The next court date will be on July 19th, 2014' is incorrect. It should be 'The next court date will be on July 19th, 2014.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the time of the court hearing. The original text mentioned 'at 3 o'clock in the afternoon', but the user did not include this detail in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context of the subpoena in the translation. The original text mentioned that subpoenas will be sent to the three individuals mentioned by the defendant, but this information is missing in the user's translation.

Yes, I will be here.
可以我會到。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. The correct translation should be '我會到可以。'

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
 Ms. Chen, the next court date you can decide to come or not. The main purpose on that day will be to ask defendant’s professor classmates some questions about that day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff's presence in court.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'defendant's professor classmates' before 'some questions', resulting in a confusing sentence structure.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
Well won’t show up. I don’t want to take one day off.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not wanting to take one day off.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. So the procedure ends here. Please leave after you sign the statement.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'Please leave after you sign the statement' instead of 'Please leave after you sign the statement.'

When you wanted to returned the umbrella, the plaintiff found that you took her umbrella. Therefore, she filed the case today we are going to understand what happened that day. Please answer my questions to let me…our….know what happened that day. After that, I will ask the plaintiff about the situation in that day. Do both parties know the procedure?

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you at 4:15 pm, on May 27, 2014.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff at that day?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'see' should be in the past tense to agree with the past time frame.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有,當我把雨傘放回傘架時,我有看到他
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '看到' should agree with the subject '我' (I), so it should be '我看到他' instead of '我有看到他'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
So what happened that day?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對我咆嘯,並說我偷了她的傘,我是有告訴他我只是拿錯散而已,我真的沒有偷他的傘,我試著向他道歉,但他完全不聽
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "他對我咆嘯,並說我偷了她的傘" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "他對我咆嘯，說我偷了她的傘".
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase "我是有告訴他" is a literal translation of "I tried to tell him", but it does not convey the same meaning. The correct translation should be "我試著告訴她".

Why did she say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'she' instead of 'Miss Chen'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'did' instead of 'does' in the question.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
在那天我和我的同學去參觀博物館,當我看完展覽之後,我兩個同學說他們餓了,所以我們決定出去找東西吃,看看要吃什麼晚餐,當我要離開博物館的時候,我發現正在下噢,我沒有帶傘,所以我想要跟我的同學借,因為我人比較高大一點,所以我想要像我的同學-亞當借傘,因為他體型跟我很像,所以我就從傘架上拿了一把傘,所以我想去買一些麵包給我的教授和同學,當我回來的時候陳小姐就在那哩,開始對我大叫
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'yell' is translated as '大叫' which means 'shout loudly' instead of '責罵' which means 'scold'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我想要像我的同學-亞當借傘' is incorrect. It should be '我想要借亞當的傘像我的同學一樣'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the professor and two other friends went with the speaker to buy bread.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you took was your friend, Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated 'borrowed' as 'took', changing the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的我當時認為那把傘就是亞當的,我當時並有想要偷任何人的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the shape and the color of the umbrella you took that day?

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得他是一把藍色的傘,而且不是一把新的傘
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'umbrella' as '傘' which means 'umbrella' instead of 'color' which means '顏色'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the speaker only remembering the color.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
So the whole is blue…..so the whole umbrella is blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我記憶中那把傘就是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '記憶' which means 'memory' instead of '回憶' which means 'reminiscence'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone prove your statement?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的當我離開博物館的時候我的教授跟我兩個同學都跟我一起,我的教授甚至說他要借我他的傘,但是因為他的傘實在太小了,所以我就沒有跟他拿,我不想要他被雨淋濕,而我也不想要另外兩個同學淋濕
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我的教授甚至說他要借我他的傘' should be '我的教授甚至說要借他的傘給我'.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想應該是可以

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
So do any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著把傘還他,但他不理我,我也試著向他道歉,但他也是完全不理睬我,或許我的教授跟同學可以為我佐證我說的話,也可以證明我那天的行為

In that day, I…. went to Yigge Ceramic Musem and it was a rainy day. I put my umbrella in. the umbrella rack before I went into the museum. But when I went out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the museum staff to help me to search my umbrella; finally, I found that the defendant took my umbrella. When I found that the umbrella he hold is my umbrella, I was very angry.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '藍色的' as 'blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now I’m going to show you a picture. In the file 1 ……….. Is that umbrella in the picture is yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it’s mine.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in that picture is very a common one which can buy in 7-11…in the convenience store. How can you sure that the umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'a' is missing before 'very common one'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of 'which can buy in 7-11' should be 'which can be bought in 7-11'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'in the convenience store' which is important for the context.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I bought my umbrella in the convenience store. However, there is some defect on my umbrella, it cannot be attached…. closely. I was….I told to the police that feature when I go to the police station. The umbrella backed to the umbrella rack has same feature, so I sure that it is my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'I was....I told to the police that feature when I go to the police station.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'The umbrella backed to the umbrella rack has same feature, so I sure that it is my umbrella.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the word 'not' in the sentence 'it cannot be attached…. closely.'
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	missing the context of reporting the incident to the police

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
So if the defendant is regrettable for this case. Do you want to settle this course? However, it is just a umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
Why do you mean “it is a umbrella?” It is concerned about morality. If he didn’t return my umbrella, should I went to home without umbrella? So I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '只是' as 'it is'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'should I went to home without umbrella'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. So we will subpoena the three people the defendant just mentioned to ask to explain what happened in that day. The next court set on the June 19, 2014. 3pm. Do both party can come to the court?

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, it is your choice to come or not to come. Basically, we will ask the defendant’s professor and friends to understand the details in that day.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?

So, Mr. Ho, can you tell me where were… where were you at 20… 2014, May 27th, 4…um…4:15 in the afternoon?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the question

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you… did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
當我要把傘放回傘架時，她就在那裏。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她就在那裏' instead of '就在那裏她'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大喊大叫，說我偷了她的傘。我告訴她我應該是拿錯傘了。我並沒有偷她的傘，我試著向她解釋，但她根本不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我應該是拿錯傘了' should be '我應該是拿錯了傘'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Then why Ms. Chen said you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'asked'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
當天我和一些同學到陶瓷館去看一個展覽。我們看完展覽之後，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定出去買點吃的，或是決定找個地方吃晚餐。我離開博物館的時候，發現正在下雨，因為我沒有帶傘，所以本來打算跟同學借一把。因為我人比較大隻，所以我打算跟我同學Adam借傘，他的身形跟我比較像。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘。然 後我就和我的教授和朋友去買了點麵包。我們回來的時候，那個時候就是陳小姐開始對我大喊大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們看完展覽之後' is incorrect. It should be '我們看完展覽後'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject '我的兩個同學' should be followed by the verb '說' instead of '說他們很餓'. It should be '我的兩個同學說他們很餓'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '決定' should be in the past tense to match the context. It should be '我們決定出去買點吃的' instead of '我們決定出去買點吃的'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun '我' should be used instead of '我們' in the sentence '所以我們決定出去買點吃的'. It should be '所以我決定出去買點吃的'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '所以我從傘架拿了一把傘' is incorrect. It should be '所以我拿了一把傘從傘架上'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after '然後' in the sentence '然後我就和我的教授和朋友去買了點麵包'.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The name '陳小姐' should be translated as 'Ms. Chen' instead of '陳小姐'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you took that day… you borrowed that day, was from your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	word choice errors	The word 'took' was translated as 'borrowed', which changes the meaning.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我以為那把傘是亞當的。我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Can you recall that the umbrella you took that day, the color and the shape…?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Can you recall the color and shape of the umbrella you took that day?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，是一把藍色的傘，而且沒有很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the umbrella being a 'one' and not 'brand new'.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Did the whole umbrella was blue?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
印象中，它就是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '印象中', which means 'in my impression', but the original text means 'from what I remember'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anybody can prove what you just said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
可以，當我從陶瓷館出來的時候，我的教授和兩個同學跟我在一起。我教授本來還說要借我她的傘，但她的傘…因為太小了，所以我沒有拿。我不想要教授淋溼，而且我的兩個同學也都在那邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '但她的傘…因為太小了，所以我沒有拿'

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So… the three person, your professor and your two classmates, they can vertify (verify) your words in the court, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice: 'vertify' instead of 'verify'.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence that you want the court investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我曾經…我試著把傘還給陳小姐，但她不拿；我也曾向…我也曾經試著跟他道歉，但她不聽。也許我教授和同學可以證明我所說的是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著把傘還給陳小姐' is incorrect. It should be '我試著把傘還給陳小姐'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也曾向…我也曾經試著跟他道歉' is incorrect. It should be '我也曾經試著向她道歉'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence '但她不聽'. It should be '但她不聽我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'my professor and my friends' in the sentence '也許我教授和同學可以證明我所說的是真的'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK. Now I’m going to ask Ms. Chen what happened that day. Ms. Chen can you give us a description what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Can you give us a description of what happened that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day, and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack outside the museum. When I got out, my umbrella was gone. I ask the staff to look for my umbrella, and that’s the time I saw this foreigner took the umbrella and put it back here. When I found out that umbrella was my missing umbrella, I was furious, and I asked why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside? How can he do such thing?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they asked the museum staff to help them find the umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '鶯歌博物館' as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' instead of 'Yingge Museum'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'that’s the time' instead of 'that was when'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The user used 'he' instead of 'the foreigner' when referring to the person who took the umbrella.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user did not translate '鶯歌' as 'Yingge', which is the name of a place in Taiwan.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Can you tell me the… the color and the shape… is there any feature of your umbrella you brought that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
It was blue, and I suppose it was a deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '應該是深藍色的' as 'I suppose it was a deep blue' instead of 'it should be a dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please see the investigatory book and the evident one. Can you tell us is the umbrella yours?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '提示偵卷' as 'investigatory book' instead of 'original text'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the photo being on the 5th page.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
Actually, this umbrella looks very common, is a very common…it’s a very common type umbrella. You can bought it…you can buy it in 7-11, how can you tell this is exactly your umbrella?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'bought' instead of 'buy' and repeated 'very common' unnecessarily.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'it' after 'bought' instead of before.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user repeated 'it's a very common' unnecessarily.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
But if the other side, if this foreigner, have the regretful thought and he wants to apologize, can you… do you consider to forgive him or reach a settlement? Because it’s just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has subject-verb agreement errors.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? It’s the problem of someone’s moral questions. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, what do you want? I walked… I walked home in those heavy rain? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'it's just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean it's just an umbrella'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. Instead of 'I walked... I walked home in those heavy rain?', it should be 'Do you want me to walk home in that heavy rain?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' which means 'if he didn't return it that day'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

The next court will be held at three o’clock afternoon, in 2014, June 19th. And the three witness and the defendant will here. Defendant, is this time OK for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'the court will send subpoena to the… those three party'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Incorrect subject-verb agreement in the sentence 'the professor and the two classmates, and ask them to vertify (verify) what the defendant said in the court'

omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after 'June 19th' in the sentence 'The next court will be held at three o’clock afternoon, in 2014, June 19th'

Yes, I will be here.
我可以，我會到場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
 Ms. Chen, you don’t have to be here in the next court. The main purpose that day will be asking what really happened from… ask professor and his classmates what really happened that day. But if you want to come… but if you want to come, it’s also welcomed.

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The defendant, Paul Anderson, was accused of theft for picking the plaintiff’s umbrella in Yingge Ceramics Museum at May 27th 2014. This action happened without inform the plaintiff. As the defendant tried to put the umbrella back, this action was found by the plaintiff. As a result, she sued the case. Today we are her for investigatory procedure. We are here today to clarify what happened on that day. Please answer my questions so that we can figured out what happened on the day. Do both parties fully understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (picked the plaintiff's umbrella) should be translated as 偷了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (stole the plaintiff's umbrella)

I understand.
我了解了

我了解。
I understand.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you and what were you doing at 4:15 PM on May27th 2014?

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Do you see the plaintiff Miss Chen at that time?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'see' should be in the past tense to agree with the past time indicated by 'at that time'.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
當我把傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐剛好在那裡
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐剛好在那裡' instead of '剛好在那裡陳小姐'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對著我大吼說我偷了她的雨傘，我試著跟她解釋我只是拿錯把雨傘了，我並沒有偷她的雨傘，我試著跟她解釋，但她不願意接受
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她對著我大吼說我偷了她的雨傘'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'I must have taken the wrong one' as '我只是拿錯把雨傘了' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be translated as '我可能拿錯了' to express the possibility of taking the wrong umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'I did not steal her umbrella' as '我並沒有偷她的雨傘' is incorrect. It should be translated as '我沒有偷她的雨傘' to convey the negation of stealing.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著跟她解釋，但她不願意接受' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試著跟她解釋，但她不願意接受我的道歉'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
So why did Miss Chen said that you stole her umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟我的同學一起到鶯歌陶瓷博物館去參觀，當我們看完展覽的時候，有幾個同學說他們肚子餓了，因此我們決定一起出去吃個東西，可能找地方吃晚餐，當我在博物館的時候，我發現正在下雨，因為我沒有帶傘　所以我想說跟我同學借一把傘，因為我比較高比較壯，所以我打算跟一名叫做泰德的同學借雨傘，他的身形跟我比較相像，所以我就從傘架裡面拿了一把傘，我想要跟我的同學還有教授一起去買麵包回來，當我們回來時，也就是陳小姐再對我大吼的那一刻。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong name used
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	verb form does not agree with subject

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean the umbrella is the one you borrowed from Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '同學' as 'Adam' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對我以為我拿走的是亞當的雨傘，我沒有意識到我拿錯了
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the umbrella you took on that day fits in what color?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得他是一把藍色的傘，看起來沒有很新
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'umbrella' as '傘' which means 'umbrella' instead of 'color' which means '顏色'.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
You mean the whole umbrella is blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我印象當中它應該是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '在我印象當中', which means 'In my impression'. The correct translation should be '在我回憶中', which means 'In my memory'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can somebody prove it for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有，當我從博物館出來的時候，我的教授跟同學們都可以幫我作證，我教授甚至說他可以把她的傘借給我，但因為她的傘太小了 所以我就沒有跟她借，因為我不想要讓她的身體也濕掉，而且當時還有兩個同學在旁邊
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'lend' as '作證'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the professor offering the umbrella because it was small

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three persons can prove it for you on the court, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'prove' should agree with the plural subject 'persons'.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you need any other assistance from the court?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about requesting the prosecutor to investigate specific evidence.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想要把傘還給她但是陳小姐不想接受，我嘗試跟她解釋，但她卻一點也不願意聽，也許我的教授跟我的同學們可以幫我證明我說的是真的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我想要把傘還給她" is incorrect. It should be "我想把傘還給她".
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb "不想接受" should agree with the subject "陳小姐". It should be "陳小姐不想接受".
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb "不願意聽" should agree with the subject "她". It should be "她不願意聽".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase "I tried to apologize to her" in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase "Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove" in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase "what I have said today is the truth" in the translation.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK now I am going to ask the plaintiff what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
On that day I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it was a rainy day. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. As I finished my exhibition, I found that my umbrella is gone. I asked the museum’s officer to help me for finding my umbrella. Later on, I found the defendant took my umbrella. As I found that he took my umbrella, I was very angry. And I asked him why he took my umbrella; didn’t he know it was raining outside? You can’t do that!
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misunderstanding of the concept of public morality
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the fact that the defendant returned the umbrella

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What’s the color of your umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I took on that day is a blue one, deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'deep blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the investigatory file, page 1. Look at the picture. Is the umbrella in this picture yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture is a very common one which can buy in any convenience store. How can you be so sure that umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '7-11可以買到的那種' as 'which can buy in any convenience store', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '7-11可以買到的那種'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes I bought it in a convenience store. It’s true but my umbrella’s button is broken. So I can easily recognize it. I told the police when I was at the police station. The umbrella, which the foreigners put back, also shares the trait. So I think that is my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'So I can easily recognize it.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was bought at 7-11.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they explained to the police about the broken button.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was put back by foreigners.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '由此可知' as 'So I think'. The correct translation is 'From this, it can be known'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Will you consider to forgive him if he sincerely apologize to you. It’s just an umbrella, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean about it’s just an umbrella? This is something about moral, attitudes. If he didn’t put the umbrella back, maybe I have to go home with the pouring rain. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'it's just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean about it's just an umbrella?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the phrase 'What do you mean about it's just an umbrella?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' which means 'if he didn't put it back that day'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. OK then we will send three sopeanas to those people he just mentioned and ask them come to the court to explain what happened on that that. The next court is at 3 PM on June19th, in 2014. Is the defendant and your three friends be here? Is that ok with you?

Yes, I will be here.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, the next court you can choose to come or not. It depends on you. Basically, we are going to ask the defendant and his friends and his professor. So if you are not here, it’s okay.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The next court you can choose to come or not, Miss Chen.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the purpose of asking the defendant's friends and professor is to gather information.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
I won’t be here. I don’t want…

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟我的一些同學去那邊看一個展覽。我們看完之後，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們就出去想找點吃的，或許就是吃個晚餐這樣吧。正當我要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了。我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟我一個同學借。因為我就是蠻高…蠻大…蠻胖的，所以我想跟我的朋友亞當借一隻傘，他跟我的體型比較像。所以我有從傘架拿了一隻傘，然後我就跟教授去買一些麵包，當我回來的時候陳小姐就開始對我叫。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對啊，我以為我拿的傘是亞當的，我沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Was the umbrella blue? All over the umbrella blue?

In my recollection, the color was blue.
嗯，回想起來是沒錯。

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有啊，我那時候走出博物館的時候，我的教授和我的兩個同學都和我在一起。我的教授還說她可以把傘借給我。但因為她的傘很小，我就沒有跟她借。我不想要她淋濕，而且我還有兩個同學在旁邊。

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
On that day I went to Ying Ge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. When I went into the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack, and when I came out, my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff of the museum to look for it for me, and then I see this foreign coming back, wanting to put the umbrella back. When I found that the umbrella he was taking is mine, I was very angry and questioned him why he took my umbrella away. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How can a person have no such responsibility?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was found and returned by the foreigner.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'wanting' instead of 'was' in the sentence 'and then I see this foreign coming back, wanting to put the umbrella back.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '質問' as 'questioned' instead of 'asked' in the sentence 'I questioned him why he took my umbrella away.'
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user used 'Didn’t he know' instead of 'Did he not know' in the sentence 'Didn’t he know that it was raining outside?'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
So…what color was your umbrella on that day? What other traits did it have?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was your umbrella on that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought on that day was blue. It was dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please look at the picture on page five on the investigation file. Please take a look at the picture. Is this umbrella yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it was that umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on the photo was very ordinary. It’s like one you can buy in 7-11. How can you make sure it was yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '照片中這把傘是很普通的那種' as 'The umbrella on the photo was very ordinary.' The correct translation should be 'The umbrella in the photo is a very ordinary one.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'was' before the subject 'umbrella' in the sentence 'The umbrella on the photo was very ordinary.' The correct word order should be 'The umbrella in the photo is a very ordinary one.'

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I did buy my umbrella at 7-11. However there was a damage on the button part, so I know it was mine. I did explain about this when I filed for the case to the prosecutor. The umbrella which the foreigner put back also possesses that trait…so I know that the umbrella is mine…was mine.
grammar and structure	tense errors	inconsistent verb tense
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'put back'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'when I filed for the case to the prosecutor'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then I would like to ask you, if the other…the defendant…is willing to regret and apologize, would you forgive him? Because it was just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by referring to the defendant instead of the other person mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant being willing to regret and apologize.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by it was just an umbrella? It is a matter of whether he cares for others or not. If he didn’t take the umbrella back, do you want me to go out when it was raining? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'it was just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean by it was just an umbrella'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' which means 'if he didn't take it back that day'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. So I will subpoena the three people he mentioned to the court and ask them to prove what he said was right. The next court will be set at 3 PM, June 19th, 2014. Plantiff, defendant, and the three witnesses should be here. Defendant, is the date OK with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Plantiff, defendant, and the three witnesses should be here.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of sending subpoenas to the three people mentioned by the defendant.

Yes, I will be here.
好的，我會到。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, you may come or not in the…on the next court. Basically who we are asking are the defendant’s professor and classmates, but if you would like to come, it will be OK as well.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, I don’t think I’m coming. I need to take that day off if I would like to come.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

The incident happened on May 27th ,2014. At Yingge Ceramics Museum. The defendant took the plaintiff Chen Xiao Chen’s umbrella.

Later I will ask the plaintiff some questions. Do the both party understand the procedure?

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, Where were you at 4:15 in the evening, May 27th ,2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Where were you at 4:15 in the afternoon on May 27th, 2014?'

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see Miss Chen? The plaintiff ?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'you' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'did' instead of 'do' in the question.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有，當我把傘放回傘架上時，她就在那裏
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened that day?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大叫，說我偷了她的傘，我試著告訴她我一定是拿錯了， 我並沒有偷， 我試著跟他道歉，但她不聽
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著跟他道歉" is incorrect. It should be "我試著跟她道歉" to match the gender of the person being apologized to.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the pronoun "I" in the sentence "我試著告訴她我一定是拿錯了". It should be "我試著告訴她我一定是拿錯了" to indicate that the user is the one who took the wrong umbrella.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why Miss Chen said you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'asked'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'said' before the subject 'Miss Chen', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我跟一些同學去博物館看展， 我們看完時，有兩個同學說他們餓了，所以我們決定出去買一些東西，甚至去找吃晚餐的地方，當我們要離開博物館時，我發現下雨了，我沒有帶傘，所以決定跟我同學借，因為我比較高大，我決定跟亞當借傘，他的身型跟我比較像， 我從傘架拿了一把傘，我跟兩個同學還有教授去買了一些麵包 ，我們回來的時候就是陳小姐對我大叫的時候
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我們看完時' (When we finished viewing)

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean the umbrella you borrowed is Adam’s umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '同學' as 'umbrella' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對 ，我想我拿的傘是亞當的 ，我沒有企圖要偷別人的傘
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'steal' was translated as '偷' which means 'to steal' in Chinese, but in this context, it should be translated as '拿' which means 'to take'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color or the shape of the umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，不是新的
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the item not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我記憶裡，它是藍色的

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can someone verify what you just said?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
當我離開博物館時，我的教授跟兩個同學跟我一起，我的教授甚至提議借我傘， 但他的傘有點小，我沒有拿， 我不想他淋濕， 我的其他兩個同學也在那裏
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我的教授跟兩個同學跟我一起' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我跟我的教授和兩個同學一起'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '跟' should be followed by the subject '我', not '我的教授'. The correct sentence should be '我跟我的教授和兩個同學一起'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '跟' should be in the past tense to match the context of the sentence. The correct sentence should be '我跟我的教授和兩個同學一起走出博物館時'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the professor and classmates were with the user when they came out from the museum. The correct translation should include this detail.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So three of them can be in court to verify what you just said, Right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著把傘還給陳小姐，但她不接受，我試著跟他道歉，她也不接受 也許我的教授跟朋友能證明我今天說的都是真的
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我試著跟他道歉' (I tried to apologize to her). The correct word order should be '我試著跟她道歉' (I tried to apologize to her).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'either' in the sentence '我試著跟他道歉，她也不接受' (I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn't listen to me, either). The correct translation should be '我試著跟他道歉，她也不接受，也不聽我' (I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn't listen to me, either).

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Ok, now I am going to ask Miss Chen the details on that day.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I want to Yingge ceramics museum on that day. It was raining. When I was about to enter the museum, I put the umbrella on the umbrella track. When I came out, it disappeared. I ask the staff to help me find it. Later I saw the foreigner put the umbrella back. I was angry. Ask him why did you take my umbrella? Didn’t he know it was raining outside? How a person can be so impolite?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I want to Yingge ceramics museum on that day.' It should be 'I went to the Yingge ceramics museum on that day.'

The umbrella in the picture is general. You can buy it in the convenient store. How could you sure it is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought it in 7-11. But the locker part of the umbrella is broken. It cannot luck. When I report the case, I explained it to the police carefully. The umbrella the foreigner put back has the same feature, so it is my umbrella.

The defendant, Paul Anderson, on May 27, 2014 went to Inge Museum and had taken the umbrella of the plaintiff, Xiao-Chen Cheng. This act was committed without notifying the plaintiff beforehand. When you were going to return the umbrella, you were caught red-handed with the umbrella by the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff pressed the charge. The goal of our procedure today, is to understand what happened that day. Please answer accordingly to my questions, do you understand? Later on, I will also inquire the plaintiff to understand what happened that day. Do both parties understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Inge Museum should be translated as Yinge Museum
omission or addition	omitting important details	The date should be translated as May 27, 2014 instead of 103年05月27日

I understand.
我了解

我了解。
 I understand, too.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
This question is for the defendant. On 4:15PM of May 27th 2014, where were you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen, at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you see Ms. Chen, the plaintiff, at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有，我當時要把傘放回傘架時有看到他
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '看到' should agree with the subject '我' (I), so it should be '看到了' (saw).

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'then' which is important for the context.

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她向我大叫，說我偷了她的傘。我嘗試告訴他我可能搞錯了，拿錯傘。我並不是在偷他的傘，我…嘗試要向他解釋，但他不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我並不是在偷他的傘，我...'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '拿錯傘' is translated as 'taken the wrong one' instead of 'took the wrong one'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'She yelled at me' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'I tried to apologize to her' in the translation

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Then why would Ms. Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和幾個同學一起去看展。看完展後，我有幾個同學說他們餓了。所以我們決定出去找個東西吃，可能找個地方吃晚餐。當我們要離開博物館時，我們發現開始下雨了。因為我本來沒有帶傘，我本來要和我同學借。因為我身形比較高大，我本來要和我朋友亞當借傘。他的體型和我比較相近。之後我就從傘架裡面抽了一支傘，然後和我的教授和同學們出去了。當我們回來的時候，就是被陳小姐大罵的時候。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我和幾個同學一起去看展' should be '我和幾個同學一起去看展覽'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我本來要和我同學借' should be '我本來要和我的同學借'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我本來要和我朋友亞當借傘' should be '我本來要和我的朋友亞當借傘'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '之後我就從傘架裡面抽了一支傘' should be '之後我就從傘架裡面抽了一把傘'

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
So you mean the umbrella you borrowed belonged to Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '同學' as 'Adam' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我以為我手中那隻傘是亞當的，而我沒有意圖偷那支傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella that day?

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得傘的顏色，他是藍色的，也不是新的那種。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the mention of the umbrella at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the past tense 'was' instead of the present tense 'is' to describe the color of the umbrella.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
The whole umbrella is blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
回想起來，傘的確是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '回想起來' which means 'recall' or 'remember', but the original text implies that the color was blue in the user's memory.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone prove that for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有，當我離開博物館的時候，教授和兩個同學都在我身邊。我的教授甚至主動借我他的傘。但是因為他的傘比較小，我就沒有答應他。我不想要老師林濕。當然我另外兩個同學…當時也在場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我就沒有答應他' is incorrect. It should be '我就沒有答應他的傘'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun '他' should be '她' to match the gender of the professor.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor's umbrella was small, which is important for understanding why the user didn't take it.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the sentence '當然我另外兩個同學...當時也在場', which is not present in the original text and is unnecessary.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three people you mentioned will be able to come to court to prove your statement, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Are there any evidence you wish the prosecutor to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想要歸還傘給陳小姐，但他不願意拿。我嘗試向她道歉，但她不願意聽我說。或許我的教授和朋友們可以幫我證明我今天講的話屬實。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我想要歸還傘給陳小姐' (I want to return the umbrella to Ms. Chen). The correct word order should be '我想要歸還陳小姐的傘' (I want to return Ms. Chen's umbrella).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我嘗試向她道歉' (I tried to apologize to her). The correct word order should be '我嘗試向她道歉' (I tried to apologize to her).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '但她不願意聽我說' (but she wouldn't listen to me). The correct word order should be '但她不願意聽我說' (but she wouldn't listen to me).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '或許我的教授和朋友們可以幫我證明我今天講的話屬實' (Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth). The correct word order should be '或許我的教授和朋友們可以幫我證明我今天講的話是真實的' (Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove that what I have said today is true).

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
All right, now I will inquire Ms. Chen for what happened that day. Ms. Chen, can you explain what happened that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
When I went to Inge Museum, it was raining then. When I entered the museum, I placed my umbrella in to the umbrella rack. But when I came out, my umbrella was missing. I asked the museum staff to help me look for the umbrella. And when I came back, I found this person returning the umbrella. When I realized the umbrella in his hands belonged to me, I was very angry and I asked him why did he take my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside, how could he be so impolite?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was found and returned by the foreigner.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form '拿' instead of '拿回來' to indicate that the foreigner returned the umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '沒有公德心' as 'impolite' instead of 'lack of civic-mindedness'.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What color was your umbrella? Are there any characteristics to it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought to the museum that day was blue. It should be dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Is the umbrella in this picture…Does this umbrella belong to you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, this is my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture is a very…. common umbrella. The kind of umbrella you can find in 7-11, how do you know the umbrella belongs to you?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'common' does not accurately convey the meaning of '普通' in this context.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
That’s true, I bought my umbrella at 7-11, but the button on my umbrella is a bit broken. On this point, when I filed the case to the police, I emphasized this point.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the umbrella was put back on the umbrella stand by a foreigner.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
The umbrella the foreigner placed in the umbrella rack had the same characteristic, so I knew the umbrella was mine. May I ask you if he regrets what he did and is willing to apologize, are you willing to forgive him? I mean it is only an umbrella after all.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was stolen.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by “it’s only an umbrella.” If he didn’t return it to me that day, I would have to go home in the rain. I am not willing to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'only' instead of 'what do you mean by'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'return' before the subject 'he' instead of after
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'if he didn't return it to me that day' in the translation

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. Then we will send warrants to the three people… the three witnesses that day, and ask them to come to court. The next court will be held on June 19th 2014, at 3PM, the three witnesses and the defendant should be here in court. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'the three people... the three witnesses that day' should be 'the three witnesses... that day'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage: 'The next court will be held on June 19th 2014' should be 'The next court will be held on June 19th, 2014'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error: 'the three witnesses and the defendant should be here in court' should be 'the three witnesses and the defendant should be in court'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail: The original text mentions that warrants will be sent to the three people, but the translation omits this information.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail: The original text mentions that the three witnesses and the defendant should be in court, but the translation omits this information.
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after the date in the sentence: 'June 19th 2014, at 3PM' should be 'June 19th, 2014, at 3PM'.

Yes, I will be here.
是，我會到場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我會到場' instead of '是，我會到場。'

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The plaintiff, Ms. Chen, the next court you can choose to come at your will. Basically, this is an inquiry for the defendant and his two classmates and professor, so it will be all right if you don’t come.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
I think not… because I’d have to… take a day off from work.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'take a day off from work', which is an important detail in the original text.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. All right, our court ends here. May the two parties please sign here, and you may leave.

今為偷竊案件偵字1425號偵查程序

The fifth floor number four, number 132, Xue-Fu Road, Sanshia district, New Taipei City.

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The incident happens on May 27, 2014. The defendant Paul Anderson took an umbrella when he was in Ying Ge Ceramics Museum, and the defendant Paul Anderson took the plaintiff’s umbrella without informing her. When the defendant wanted to return the umbrella back to its owner, Hsiao-Chien Wang…caught him. Therefore, Hsiao-Chien Wang filed this case. In today’s procedure, we need to mainly understand what happened that day. Please answer all of my questions so that the prosecutor can understand what exactly happened that day, do you understand? And after this procedure, I will ask the plaintiff what really happened that day, so do both parties understand today’s procedures?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the name of the plaintiff as 'Hsiao-Chien Wang' instead of '陳小倩'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'caught' before the subject 'Hsiao-Chien Wang', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the defendant returned the umbrella back to its owner.

I understand.
了解了。

我了解。
Me, too. I understand, too.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you at four fifteen, on May 27, in year 2014? Four fifteen in the afternoon….
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect. It should be 'Where were you at four fifteen on May 27, 2014?'

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我那時在三峽鶯歌陶瓷的博物館。
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '三峽鶯歌陶瓷的博物館', which means 'Yingge Ceramics Museum in Sanxia'. The user misunderstood the location of the museum.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
 Did you see the plaintiff Hsiao-Chien Chen at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The subject and verb are in the wrong order.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有，在我把傘放回傘架時，小倩小姐就在那理。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '小姐小倩' instead of '小倩小姐'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她大喊:「是你偷了我的傘!」我告訴她我應該是拿錯傘了啦。我真的沒有偷她的傘，我一直試著跟她道歉，但是她就是不接受。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我告訴她我應該是拿錯傘了啦" is incorrect. It should be "我告訴她我應該是拿錯了傘啦".
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase "拿錯傘了啦" is translated as "must have taken the wrong one" which does not accurately convey the meaning of "拿錯了傘啦" which means "took the wrong umbrella".

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Then why did Hsiao-Chien Chen claimed you of stealing her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐會說' as 'claimed' instead of 'said'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'claimed' instead of 'claimed that', resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the possessive pronoun 'her' before 'umbrella'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館參展看展啊。看完展覽後，其中有兩個同學就說他們餓了。所以我們就決定出去找找食物，找個能吃晚餐的地方。一離開博物館的時候，就下雨了。因為我沒有帶雨傘，所以我就決定借我同學的傘。因為我比較高壯一點，所以我就決定借我同學亞當的傘，因為他的體型跟我很像。所以我就從傘架拿出一個傘，然後和我的教授和兩個朋友一起去買麵包。當我們這群人回到博物館後，陳小姐就對我大喊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '一離開博物館的時候' is incorrect. It should be '離開博物館的時候一' to follow the correct Chinese sentence structure.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '參展看展' should be separated into two separate verbs '參展' and '看展' to maintain subject-verb agreement.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '就決定' should be in the past tense '就決定了' to match the past tense context of the sentence.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun '我們這群人' should be '我們' to avoid redundancy and maintain clarity.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '找個能吃晚餐的地方' is translated as 'find a place for dinner' which does not accurately convey the meaning of '找個能吃晚餐的地方' which means 'find a place where we can eat dinner'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that Ms. Chen started to yell at the speaker.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
 So do you mean that at that time, the umbrella that you borrowed was…you borrowed it from Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '你同學亞當的' as 'you borrowed it from Adam' instead of 'the umbrella of your classmate Adam'

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的。我當時是真的認為是亞當的傘。我根本就沒有想到要偷別人的傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of 'belonged to' as '認為是' (thought it was).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase '是亞當的傘' (belonged to Adam), where the subject and verb are reversed.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Then do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you took that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，然後沒有很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the item not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
據我所知，對，全部都是藍的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by adding the phrase '全部都是' which means 'all of them' and implies that everything was blue, not just the color.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can someone proof what you said was right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
可以啊，跟我出去的教授還有兩位同學一起來開博物館，他們可以證明。我教授甚至還願意借我他的雨傘。但是由於他的傘太小，所以我就謝絕他。而且我也不希望我的教授淋雨啊，那時候我兩個同學都在。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	教授 -> 教授甚至還願意借我他的雨傘
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	我 -> 我的教授淋雨啊
omission or addition	omitting important details	我 -> 我兩個同學都在

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
If so, then these three people will be able to come to the court and play as the role of the witnesses, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I guess so.
應該可以吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Then is there anything else you wish the prosecutor to investigate?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著要還給陳小姐她的傘了，但是她不接受，然後我試著跟她道歉，她也不接受。我認為我的教授和兩位同學都來到這裡證明我所說得一切都是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著要還給陳小姐她的傘了" is incorrect. It should be "我試著要把她的傘還給陳小姐了".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著跟她道歉，她也不接受" is incorrect. It should be "我試著跟她道歉，但她也不接受".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense in the sentence "我認為我的教授和兩位同學都來到這裡證明我所說得一切都是真的" is incorrect. It should be "我認為我的教授和兩位同學都會來到這裡證明我所說的一切都是真的".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Okay, now let me ask Ms. Chen what really happened that day. Can you describe what happened that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
That day, it was raining, and I went to the Ceramics Museum in Ying Ge. Before entering the museum, I placed my umbrella on the umbrella rack. But when I came out of the museum, my umbrella was gone. I asked one of the workers in the museum to help me find the umbrella, and I saw this young man taking my umbrella at that time. When I saw my umbrella on his hand, I was very, very furious, and I questioned him loudly why he would want to take my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining hard at that time? Did he have any conscience?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was found and returned by the museum staff.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'have' instead of 'has' in the question 'Didn’t he know that it was raining hard at that time?'
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user used 'conscience' instead of '公德心' (sense of public morality), which is a cultural-specific concept.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Then may I ask you that what color was your umbrella that you brought that day? Did it have any special symbols?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'May I ask you what color your umbrella was that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
Well, the umbrella that I brought that day was blue. It was dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now let us look at evidence number one, page five. Please take a look at this photo. Was this umbrella yours?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in the original text.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s it. That’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture was just a very, very normal umbrella, which can be purchased in any convenience store, such as 7-11. How can you prove that this was the umbrella that you brought that day?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker's ownership of the umbrella.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
You’re right, I brought the umbrella at 7-11. However, there is something wrong with my umbrella. The button of my umbrella couldn’t work. Therefore, when I filed this case, I had explained clearly to the police about this trait. Moreover, the umbrella that this foreigner took and put back had this trait, too; therefore, I can prove that that was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The button of my umbrella couldn’t work.' It should be 'My umbrella's button couldn't work.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'The umbrella that this foreigner took and put back had this trait, too; therefore, I can prove that that was my umbrella.' It should be 'The umbrella that this foreigner took and put back has this trait, too; therefore, I can prove that it was my umbrella.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the detail that the user explained the trait of the umbrella to the police when filing the case.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of unnecessary content in the sentence: 'Moreover, the umbrella that this foreigner took and put back had this trait, too; therefore, I can prove that that was my umbrella.' The phrase 'that that' is redundant and can be simplified to 'that'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then, now the defendant apologized to you…is willing to apologize to you and showed some regrets, are you willing to forgive the defendant? Because it’s just….he accidentally took your umbrella.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of the umbrella being stolen.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
 Hey, what do you mean by saying that it was just an umbrella? It shows that this person has no conscience. I assume that if that person didn’t return my umbrella back to me on that day, then I would just end up being all wet. I will not forgive the defendant.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'only an umbrella'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'didn’t return' instead of 'doesn't return' to match the present tense used in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'if that person didn’t return my umbrella back to me on that day' from the translation.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Okay, I understand now. We will subpoena the three people as witnesses to the court, the three people that the defendant just mentioned. We’ll set up a time to open a court next time at three o’ clock pm, on June 19, 2014, and the defendant plus the three witnesses should all be here. Defendant, do you understand?

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the location where the court will be held.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我了解了。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
As for Ms. Chen, the plaintiff, you can come to the court next time, or you can choose not to. Basically, during the next court…the procedure of the next court, we will mainly ask the witnesses, including the professor what happened that day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific mention of the classmates who were present with the defendant.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'during the next court' in an awkward position in the sentence.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
Well, I won’t come on that day because I even need to take a leave.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the specific day they won't come.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
Okay, now I understand, and the court is adjourned today. Please sign the document here, and both parties can leave the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the instruction for the parties to leave the court after signing the document.

Fifth floor, room 4, number 132, Xuefu road, Sanxia district, New Taipei City.

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The incident happened on May 27th, 2014. The defendant took the plaintiff’s umbrella when he paid a visit to Yingge Ceramics Museum. This behavior took place without the consent to the plaintiff. When the defendant wanted to return the umbrella, the plaintiff found the defendant as well as her umbrella. Therefore, the plaintiff filed the case. The main purpose of this procedure is to understand what exactly happened on that day. Please answer my questions so that the prosecutor can understand the whole story on that day. Besides, the court will ask the plaintiff as well to understand the details on that day. Do you understand?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '告訴' as 'case' instead of 'lawsuit'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'The incident happened on May 27th, 2014' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'The incident happened on that day'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's name, Paul Anderson, in the translation.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you at 4:15 p.m. on May 27th, 2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see the plaintiff at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
沒錯，當我把傘放回傘架時，陳小姐就在那邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐就在那邊，當我把傘放回傘架時。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我喊說，我偷了她的雨傘。我試著跟她說，我是拿錯傘了。我並沒有都她的雨傘，我試著跟她道歉，但她都不理我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我並沒有都她的雨傘'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Then, how come the plaintiff said that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'the plaintiff' instead of 'Miss Chen'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
在那天，我跟我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館。當我們逛完博物館後，有兩個同學說他們肚子餓了。所以我們想出去買晚餐，或是找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開的時候，我發現外面在下雨。我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想要借我朋友的傘。因為我有點高大，所以想跟我的同學亞當借雨傘。他的體型跟我較接近。然後我就從傘架拿了一把傘。然後我就和我的教授跟朋友一起買了麵包。但我回來的時候，陳小姐就對我大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我跟我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館' (I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum with my classmates). The correct word order should be '我跟我的同學去了鶯歌陶瓷博物館'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '有兩個同學說他們肚子餓了' (Two classmates said they were hungry). The correct verb form should be '有兩個同學說他們肚子餓'.

grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence '所以我們想出去買晚餐，或是找個地方吃晚餐' (So we want to go out and buy dinner, or find a place to eat dinner). The correct pronoun should be '所以我們想出去買晚餐，或是找個地方吃晚餐' (So we wanted to go out and buy dinner, or find a place to eat dinner).
grammar and structure	preposition errors	Preposition error in the sentence '當我要離開的時候' (When I want to leave). The correct preposition should be '當我要離開時' (When I was about to leave).
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing punctuation in the sentence '然後我就從傘架拿了一把傘' (Then I took one umbrella from the rack). The correct punctuation should be '然後我就從傘架拿了一把傘。' (Then I took one umbrella from the rack).
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in the sentence '我跟我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館' (I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum with my classmates).

cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	Failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language in the sentence '我發現外面在下雨' (I found it was raining outside). The idiomatic expression '在下雨' (raining) should be translated as 'it was raining' or 'there was rain'.
cultural transformation	ignoring cultural taboos or sensitivities	Ignoring cultural taboos or sensitivities in the sentence '我發現外面在下雨' (I found it was raining outside). The use of '我發現' (I found) in this context may be considered impolite or inappropriate in some cultures. A more polite or neutral expression should be used.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Did you say that the umbrella you borrowed belonged to your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你的同學亞當' as 'your classmate, Adam' instead of 'your classmate, Adam's'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
沒錯，我之前看，是亞當拿著那把雨傘，我並沒有想要偷雨傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning by stating that the speaker saw Adam holding the umbrella, instead of thinking that the umbrella they took belonged to Adam.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我之前看到，是亞當拿著那把雨傘'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember the color as well as the shape of the umbrella you borrowed?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Did you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you borrowed?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，那把傘是藍色的，不是很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
So, was the umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the question being asked in the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
我記得那把傘是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation adds unnecessary details by specifying that it was an umbrella.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Was there any person or witness can prove what you just said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
當然有，當時我看我的教授和兩個朋友一起出來。我教授也想借我傘呢。但我教授的傘太小了，我辦法拿。我不想要讓我的教授和朋友被雨淋濕。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我看我的教授和兩個朋友一起出來' should be '我和我的教授以及兩個朋友一起出來'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '我教授也想借我傘呢' should be '我教授也想借我傘給我'.

semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in the sentence: '我不想要讓我的教授和朋友被雨淋濕' should be 'I didn't want my professor to get wet'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So, those three people can go to the court as witnesses to prove what you just said. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I guess so.
我是這麼覺得。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence which you hope that the prosecutor can investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著想把傘還給陳小姐，但她不接受，我也想試著道歉，但她又不願意接受。也與我的教授還有同學可以證明我剛才所說的話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著想把傘還給陳小姐' is incorrect. It should be '我試著把傘還給陳小姐'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也想試著道歉' is incorrect. It should be '我也試著想道歉'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'prove' in the translation. The correct translation should be '也可以證明我剛才所說的話'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Okay, now the court will ask the plaintiff questions about what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject 'the court' should come before the verb 'will ask'.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it was rainy on that day. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack outside. When I came out, I found that my umbrella disappeared. I asked the personnel in the museum to help me find my umbrella. However, I later saw the defendant come to the museum with my umbrella. When I saw he held my umbrella, I was very angry and yelled why you took my umbrella. Didn’t you know that it was rainy outside? How could you do this?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	using the term 'defendant' instead of 'foreigner'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Can the court the features of your umbrella you brought on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
It was blue, very deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'very deep blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the picture on the page 5 of the investigatory file 1. Is the umbrella in the picture belonging to you?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it was my umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on the picture could be commonly bought in convenient stores. How could you assure that the umbrella was yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought my umbrella in 7-11. However, the bottom on my umbrella was broken. I could recognize my umbrella with the broken feature. As to this feature, I had made my explanations to the police. The umbrella returned by the foreigner also had the same characteristic. Therefore, I was sure that that was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'As to this feature, I had made my explanations to the police.' It should be 'I had made my explanations to the police as to this feature.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the bottom on my umbrella' should be 'the bottom of my umbrella' to accurately convey the intended meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the specific location of the damage on the umbrella, which is 'at the button' in the original text.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
The plaintiff, will you consider to settle the case if the defendant shows his regret and wants to apologize to you because it was just an umbrella?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the stolen umbrella in the translation.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it was just an umbrella? It was a common moral issue among people. If the defendant didn’t return my umbrella, I would get very wet when I went home! I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是' as 'just' instead of 'common'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'defendant' instead of 'person' as the subject of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the person's lack of basic morality in their translation.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Okay, I understand. The court will subpoena the three people that the defendant just mentioned as witnesses for the case. The next court day will be set at 3:00 p.m. on June 19th, 2014. Both the people and the defendant have to attend the court on that day. The defendant, can you make it on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Both the people and the defendant have to attend the court on that day' is incorrect. It should be 'Both the defendant and the people have to attend the court on that day.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The date 'June 19th, 2014' should be in the future tense, as the court day is scheduled for the future. It should be 'June 19th, 2014 will be set as the next court day.'

Yes, I will be here.
好的，我沒問題。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The plaintiff, you can come to the court if you want. Basically, the court will ask questions with the professor and the two classmates. You also can show up if you wanted.

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?

Later I will ask plantiff some questions about that day. Do both parties understand?

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why Ms Chen said that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'Ms Chen' instead of 'Ms Chen'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
在那天的時候,我跟我同學到博物館看展覽在我看完之後,我的兩個同學說他們餓了所以我們就想出去找東西吃,為了晚餐離開博物館的時候,發現下雨了我沒有帶傘,所以我想借我同學因為我人很高大,所以我想跟亞當借把傘他的身形跟我很像所以我就從傘架拿了一把傘我跟教授和兩個同學去買麵包當我回來的時候,陳小姐就開始對我吼叫

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of important details in translation
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	lack of appropriate level of formality in translation

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean that the umbrella you borrowed belongs to your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '當時借的傘' as 'the umbrella you borrowed' instead of 'the umbrella you borrowed at that time'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'belongs' before the subject 'the umbrella', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對阿,我以為我拿的是亞當的傘,我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you took at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you remember what color and shape the umbrella you took that day was?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得是把藍色的傘,而且沒有很新
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'brand new' as '很新', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'not a brand new one'.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我看來,的確是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '在我看來', which means 'in my opinion' or 'from my perspective', instead of '在我回憶中', which means 'in my memory' or 'from my recollection'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the adjective '藍色的' (blue), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '藍色的是' (blue is).

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone prove what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有阿,當我離開博物館,我教授跟我兩個同學跟我同在我教授甚至想借我他的傘因為他的傘太小了,我就沒跟他借我不想教授淋濕,以及其他兩位同學也是
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我就沒跟他借我不想教授淋濕'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我教授跟我兩個同學跟我同在'

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the user didn't want the professor to get wet

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So those three person can come to the court to prove what you said? Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是巴

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you want the court to investifate any other evidence for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'court' in their translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'court' and 'investigate' in their translation.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想還陳小姐傘,但他不拿,我試著道歉但他也不聽我想我的教授跟朋友可以證明我今天所說的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我想還陳小姐傘' is incorrect. It should be '我想還陳小姐的傘'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '拿' should agree with the subject '他', so it should be '他不拿' instead of '他不拿'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '聽' should agree with the subject '他', so it should be '他也不聽我' instead of '他也不聽我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'today' in the sentence '我想我的教授跟朋友可以證明我今天所說的'. It should be '我想我的教授跟朋友可以證明我今天所說的事情'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Fine, now I am going to ask Ms Chen some questions about that day.Ms Chen, can you elaborate what happened at that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yinge Ceramics Museum at that day. It was raining.When I went into Yinge Ceramics Museum, I put my umbrella in the rack.When I came out, my umbrella was gone.I asked the officer at the museum for help then I saw this foreigner holding my umbrella.When I found he took my umbrella, I was quite angry. I asked him “why you take my umbrella?”“Didn’t you realize that it was raining outside? How could you do that?”
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they asked the museum officer for help before seeing the foreigner with their umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'put' before the subject 'I' in the sentence 'When I went into Yinge Ceramics Museum, I put my umbrella in the rack.'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Do you know the color of your umbrella? Is there any special pattern?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color is your umbrella?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day was blue, dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please see the picture on page.5 of the ivestigatory file one. Is the umbrella on the picture belonging to you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'investigatory' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'belonging' instead of 'belong'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on this picture is quite common. It can buy at 7-11. How could you confrim it was yours?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'confrim' should be 'confirm'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence should be 'How could you confirm that it was yours?'

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought my umbrella at 7-11. However, my umbrella has some problem with its button.For this point, when I was at the police station, I have told the police about it.The umbrella that foreigner took has this characteristic, too.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged at the button.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Will you consider to forgive him if he is regretful and is willing to apologize since it is just a umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊的只是一把傘' as 'since it is just an umbrella', which changes the meaning of the sentence. The original text does not mention the word 'just' and the user's translation implies that the umbrella is not important, while the original text does not make that distinction.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it is “just” a umbrella? If he didn’t return my umbrella at that day, I have to walk home in rain. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'just a umbrella'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'just' before the noun 'umbrella' instead of after it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '有沒有基本道德的問題' which means 'a question of basic morality'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Okay, the court will subpeona the three people that the defendant just mentioned to explain what happened at that day. The next court date is set at 3:00 p.m. June 19th 2014. The defendant and the three witnesses have to come to the court. Defendant, is that okay?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The court will subpeona the three people that the defendant just mentioned to explain what happened at that day' is incorrect. It should be 'The court will subpeona the three people that the defendant just mentioned to explain what happened on that day.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The date 'June 19th 2014' should be in the future tense, so it should be 'June 19th, 2014' instead of 'June 19th 2014.'
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after '3:00 p.m.' to separate the time from the date.

Yes, I will be here.
知到了,我會到場
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Plantiff, it’s your choice to come or not. Basically, we are going to inquire defendant’s professor and classmates. If you want to come, it is okay.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff's name and the purpose of the inquiry.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'it’s' instead of 'you are'.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, that’s fine. If I want to come, I have to take a leave.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'If I want to come, I have to take a leave.'

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
OK. Today’s procedure ends here. Please sign on this document and you can leave.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the instruction for the person to leave the seat after signing the document.

Please answer the questions that I have mentioned so that the prosecutor will understand what happened on that day. And I will also ask the plaintiff what happened on that day, do you both understand?

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
So the defendant, where were you at 4:15 on May 27th 2014?

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff Ms. Chen?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'you' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有，當我把傘放回傘架時，陳小姐剛好就在那

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Then why did Ms. Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和一些同學一起去看一些展覽，當我們看完展覽時，我2位同學說他們餓了，所以我們決定出去買一些食物並找地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，我發現下雨了，我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟我同學借傘。因為我非常高，也有點壯，所以我決定向我的朋友Adam借傘。因為他的身形跟我比較相似。所以我就從傘架拿一把傘，然後我和我的教授去買一些麵包給我的朋友。當我回來時，陳小姐就開始對我大吼大叫。

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著把傘還給陳小姐，但他不接受，我也試著向他道歉，但他也不理我。也許我的教授和2位同學都可以幫我證明我剛剛所說的話

Now I’m going to ask Ms. Chen what happened on that day. Ms. Chen can you explain what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it rained. When I entered the museum, I put the umbrella in the umbrella rack. And when I came out, I found the umbrella was gone. I asked the working staff in the museum to help me to find my umbrella and then I just saw the foreigner just put the umbrella back to the rack. When I found that the umbrella he took was the umbrella I have lost, I was very angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside? Why did he so mean?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they asked the museum staff for help in finding the umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '沒有公德心' as 'so mean', which does not accurately convey the meaning of lacking moral integrity or consideration for others.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
So what was the color of the umbrella you brought that day? Did that have any characteristic?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella you brought that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the investigatory record on page 5, is the umbrella belongs to you on that picture?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，就是這把傘。

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture was very common that can be bought in 7-11, how can you make sure that umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of themselves as the owner of the umbrella.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I bought my umbrella in 7-11; however, the bottom of my umbrella was a little broken, so I cannot just… When I reported the case, I have explained to the police. The umbrella the foreigner put back has also this characteristic, so I am sure that umbrella is mine.

So if the foreigner have regretted and is also willing to apologize, do you plan to forgive him? Because you have lost is just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What does it mean it just an umbrella? The problem now is that this is an issue about the moral. If he didn’t return the umbrella, you wanted me to got wet on that day? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '只是一把傘' is translated as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'only an umbrella'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that moment?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和我的一些同學, 參觀了陶瓷博物館的一個展覽, 我們那時候已經看完展覽了, 我的兩個同學說他們餓了. 那時候我們想說去找點食物吃, 順便吃晚餐. 當我要離開陶瓷博物館的時候, 我發現外面正在下大雨. 我沒有帶雨傘, 所以打算向同學借雨傘. 因為我長得比較高大, 所以我打算跟我同學Adam借傘, 他的體型跟我差不多. 所以我就從傘架拿了一把傘, 我和我的教授去買一些麵包. 當我們回來的時候, 那時候陳小姐就開始對我們大吼大叫.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	陶瓷博物館 (ceramic museum) should be translated as Museum of Ceramics

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean at that time, the umbrella you took was Adam’s umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '同學' as 'umbrella' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的, 當我走出博物館時我的教授和兩位同學在我旁邊, 我教授甚至要借我她的雨傘, 但她的雨傘太小所以我就沒有跟她借了, 我不希望她淋濕而且那時候其他兩位同學也在
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我教授甚至要借我她的雨傘" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我教授甚至要借她的雨傘給我".

我有試著把傘還給陳小姐但她不接受, 我也試著跟她道歉但她也不接受或許我的教授和同學能證明我剛剛講的都是事實
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我有試著把傘還給陳小姐但她不接受' should be '我有試著把傘還給陳小姐，但她不接受'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我也試著跟她道歉但她也不接受' should be '我也試著跟她道歉，但她也不接受'.

That day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and it was raining. I put the umbrella in the umbrella rack when I entered the museum.

I was very angry to discover that he took my umbrella so I yelled at him and ask him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside? How could he done such thing.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture is very common, you can buy this umbrella in any convenience store like Seven-Eleven. How can you prove that this is the one that’s stolen?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Ya, it’s true, I bought my umbrella in Seven-Eleven. But my umbrella has a broken piece at its buckle so it cannot function very well. On this point, I told the police. Then the umbrella that foreinger put back has the same feature as I said. So I’m sure he took my umbrella.

If the defendant regret about the incident and want to apologize and reconcile, are you willing to settle this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by just an umbrella? If he didn’t return the umbrella, I would have to return home all wet. I don’t want to forgive hime.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just', which does not accurately convey the intended meaning of '只是' in this context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the sentence 'I don’t want to forgive hime.' It should be 'I don’t want to forgive him.'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'Why did Miss Chen say you stole her umbrella?'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
在那天，去鶯歌博物館…看展覽的時候，我是與我的同學一起去的。然後在…在後來有兩個同學講說他們其實...就是他們感覺有點餓了，然後我們就想說要出博物館去找食物吃，就解決我們的晚餐，這樣子。在我準備要離開博物館的時候，我發現說正在下雨，那我就打算跟我的同學借一把雨傘，因為我沒有帶傘這樣子。因為我長得又高又…大，所以我就想要借我同學，亞當的傘，因為他跟我的身型很類似。於是我就從雨架上拿了一把雨傘，然後跟我的教授一起出去買麵包，跟一些其他東西吃，那在我們回來的時候，我就發現陳小姐就在傘架附近，然後開始對我大吼。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Well… So what you mean is that the umbrella belonged to your friend, Adam? Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我當時真的以為我拿的是亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷別人的傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I didn't intend to steal anyone's umbrella' as '我並沒有想要偷別人的傘', which means 'I didn't want to steal someone else's umbrella'. The meaning of 'intend' was not accurately conveyed.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Well… did you… do you remember what’s the color or the shape of the umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得它的顏色，是藍色，而且不是太新的傘。

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Was the umbrella blue all over?'

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的記憶裡面，它的確是藍色的。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone clarify the statement you just said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'to' before 'be' in the sentence.

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have anything else you wish the court to investigate for you to help you with your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
在當時，我試著想要把傘還給陳小姐，但是他不願意接受，那在當時我也試著想要跟他道歉，可是他也不願意接受我的道歉，那在當時我的教授以及我兩個同學都在一旁，那他們應該可以證實我說的是真的。

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
I understand that, then the plaintiff, what happened that day. Ms. Chen, could you tell us what happened that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
At that time… on that day, I visit Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. And I put my umbrella on the rack, but I came out of the museum, I found that my umbrella was gone. I ask the staff of the museum to find the umbrella for me, and after a while, I saw the foreigner put my umbrella back on the rack. And I found out… the umbrella he returned was mine, and I was… I was furious. How could someone so shameful that knowing it was raining and he took some else umbrella?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of questioning the foreigner about why he took the umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'on that day' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user used the word 'shameful' instead of 'without public morality' to describe the foreigner's behavior.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What’s the color or some… something special about the umbrella? Could you tell us the color or anything special about the umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day was blue, and it supposed to be a dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now, I’m going to show you the investigatory file, on page 5, the pictures…the plaintiff, could you tell us, in the picture, does the umbrella belong to you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Does the umbrella in the picture belong to you?'

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
In the photo, the umbrella is very common and very ordinary, and that is the kind of umbrella you can buy in 7-11. How could you be so sure that the umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '很普通的那種' as 'very ordinary' instead of 'common'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '妳怎麼確定' which means 'how could you be sure'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, my umbrella was bought in 7-11, but the umbrella… the umbrella I brought that day, the button was a little bit broken, so it cannot be… button up. On that day, when I was making the court script, I tell the police the same thing that my umbrella… the button on my umbrella was broken, so it cannot be button up. And the umbrella the foreigner put back on the rack has the same signature… has the same characteristic.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'the umbrella… the umbrella I brought that day'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in the sentence 'the umbrella… the umbrella I brought that day'

semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of the detail that the umbrella was put back on the rack by the foreigner
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of the phrase 'has the same signature… has the same characteristic' which is not present in the original text

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Would you… forgive the defendant if the defendant show some regret and they apologize to you. Are you willing to forgive him? After all, it’s just an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by that was just an umbrella? It is an issue of morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella for me, then I have to want home without my umbrella, and it was raining on that day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '只是一把傘' is translated as 'that was just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean by that was just an umbrella'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order. The phrase 'then I have to want home without my umbrella' should be 'then I have to go home without my umbrella'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of rain in the original text. The phrase 'and it was raining on that day' is not included in the translation.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Okay… I understand. Then we will subpoena the three witness… the defendant just mentioned. And the next proceeding will set at 3 P.M… 3 o’clock in the afternoon, on June 25th, 2018. And in the next proceeding, there will be the three witness the defendant just mentioned and ask us to subpoena. The defendant… are you okay with the date?

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Ms. Chen, in the next proceeding, you can be here, or you can choose not to attend the court because, in the next proceeding, we will ask… the teacher and the classmate of the defendant to understand what’s happening on that day and to clarify the defendant’s … saying was real or not.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

The time of the incident is on May 27th, 2018. The defendant Paul Anderson went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and stole the accuser Xiaoqian Chen’s umbrella. Because the defendant Paul Anderson didn’t inform the accuser, and when the accuser returned the umbrella to the original spot, he was caught on the spot. So the accuser filed a lawsuit to the defendant Paul Anderson. In today’s procedure, the court mainly wants to understand what happened on May 27th, 2018. And we will ask the both party to clarify the situation on that day. And do the both party understand the procedure today?

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我是跟同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽，當我們看完最後一個展物的時候，其中兩個同學跟我說他們很餓，所以我們就打算出去找一些吃的，然後去吃晚餐。當時，當我要走出去覓食的時候，我發現外面下雨了。因為我沒有帶傘，所以我就想跟其中一個同學借傘。因為我長得比較高、比較大一隻，我就想跟亞登借傘，因為他的體型跟我比較像，所以我就跟他借傘。然後我就從架上拿了一把傘，我就跟我的一位教授跟其他兩位同學出去買一些麵包。那當我回來的時候我把傘歸還時，陳小姐就對我大吼了，這就是當時的狀況。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Well, so did you mean that the umbrella you borrowed belog to your friend Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using the word 'belong' instead of 'borrow'.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，當時跟我同行去買晚餐的的教授跟同學可以為我作證。當時，教授甚至有看到我借了Adam的那把傘。那是因為教授的傘比較小，我不希望身體弄濕，所以我就沒有跟她借。然後跟我同行的其他兩位同學也知道這件事。

I guess so.
是，我想應該是這樣沒錯

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Well, then I will ask the accuser to clarify the details of the incident on that day?Miss Chen, can you briefly describe what happened on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
On that day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was a rainy day, and I put my umbrella on the rack outside the museum. When I went out the museum, and I found my umbrella was gone. Then I asked the curators of the museum to help me find my umbrella, and I saw the defendant just came back and returned my umbrella to the rack. When I found out that the foreigner took my umbrella. And it was he stole my umbrella, so I was very angry and asked him why he stole my umbrella? Didn’t he know that it was raining outside ? and why he didn’t have a conscience?

cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user used 'didn't he have a conscience?' which is not a polite way to express anger in this context.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Miss Chen, what color is your umbrella? And does your umbrella have any traits?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color is your umbrella?' instead of 'Miss Chen, what color is your umbrella?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day is blue, and I think it’s deep blue.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Show exhibit evidence, page fifteen, is the picture on the file your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片' as 'Show exhibit evidence, page fifteen'. The meaning is not accurately conveyed.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user translated '請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?' as 'is the picture on the file your umbrella?'. The word order is incorrect.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
In the picture, the umbrella is just very normal one, that people can buy from 7-11.How can you confirm that umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?' as 'How can you confirm that umbrella is yours?' instead of 'How do you know that umbrella is yours?'

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, my umbrella was bought from 7-11, but in my umbrella, its button is a little bit damaged, and I cannot close my umbrella well. When I reported to the police, I had described the details of this matter. Because the umbrella that the foreigner returned to the track also had the button trait, so I can prove that the umbrella was mine.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Well, the accuser, if the defendant has regretted what he had done and apologized to you, will you forgive him? After all, the stole item is just an umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Will you forgive him if the defendant has regretted what he had done and apologized to you?'

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that just an umbrella? Is the defendant don’t have a     conscience, and what if he didn’t return the umbrella to the rack, so that I have to go back home under the big rain, you know that? So I won’t forgive him even he apoliogizes.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'just a matter of an umbrella'.

In the next proceeding, the defendant and the three witnesses will come to the proceeding and will clarify the details of the incident. Does the time of the next proceeding you can come to the court?

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'go' instead of 'went' to match the past tense of the sentence.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the user's anger in the translation.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
I should be the dark blue one.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '應該是深藍色的' as 'I should be the dark blue one', which changes the meaning of the sentence. The correct translation would be 'It should be dark blue.'

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now I’m going to show you the exhibition 1, page 5. Is the umbrella in this photo is yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, this is mine.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on the picture is common. It’s sold in every 711 stores. How could you say that it is yours? How did you recognize it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I bought it in 711, but …the bottom on my umbrella was broke. So that cannot be closed. I explained to the police at that time. And the umbrella that foreigner put back has this description as I said.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the information about the umbrella being damaged

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then if he is…if the defendant is regret about that and he will apologize to you, will you forget him? After all, it is an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it is just an umbrella. It’s about the moral issue. It was raining that day, so if he took the umbrella, I’ll pour in rain that day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

不用了，這樣我還要請假。

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The accused, the time was happened on May 27th 2018, and happened at Yingge Ceramics Museum.

Please answer all the questions to the prosecutor and the court for them to have more understanding of the whole incident. Do you understand? And later I will also ask the accuser to state…to all the parties…involved parties know the procedure?

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The accused, I want to ask where were you at 4:15 May 27th 2018 ?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific year (2018) in the translation.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time did you see the accuser Xiaoqian Chen…at that time?
grammar and structure	repetition	The user repeated the phrase 'at that time' unnecessarily.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的當我把傘放進傘桶後就看到她。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對著我大吼說我偷走她的傘，而我只是想告訴她我拿錯了傘，我試著道歉，但她不想聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "她對著我大吼說我偷走她的傘" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "她對著我大吼說我偷走了她的傘".
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase "我拿錯了傘" is translated as "I took the wrong umbrella" instead of "I must have taken the wrong one". The meaning is not accurately conveyed.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Miss Chen said you stole her umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我後幾位同學去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館，在參觀完一些展覽之後我們肚子就有點餓，就想出去買個食物順便找一下晚餐的吃飯的地點，當我走出去博物館時就發現正在下雨，所以我就向我的同學借一把傘，因為我的體型比較高大，所以我當時是想跟Adam(我的一個同學)借傘，因為他的體型和我比較相似，於是我傘桶拿出一把傘，並且和一位教授、兩個同學去買麵包，當我回來時，就遇到Miss Chen 在傘桶旁邊對我大吼。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '那天我後幾位同學去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館' (On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum). The correct word order should be '那天我和幾位同學去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以我就向我的同學借一把傘' (So I borrowed an umbrella from my classmates). The correct word order should be '所以我就向我的同學借了一把傘'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '因為我的體型比較高大，所以我當時是想跟Adam(我的一個同學)借傘' (Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine). The correct word order should be '因為我的體型比較高大，所以我當時想借Adam(我的一個同學)的傘'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '於是我傘桶拿出一把傘' (Then I took one umbrella from the rack). The correct word order should be '於是我拿出一把傘從傘桶裡'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '並且和一位教授、兩個同學去買麵包' (And I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends). The correct word order should be '並且和一位教授、兩個同學一起去買麵包'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '當我回來時，就遇到Miss Chen 在傘桶旁邊對我大吼' (When I came back, that's when Ms. Chen started to yell at me). The correct word order should be '當我回來時，就遇到陳小姐在傘桶旁邊對我大吼'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
What did you mean as that the umbrella is borrowed from your classmates Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the original text and translated it as borrowing the umbrella from a classmate named Adam.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的我當時認為我是借他的傘，我並沒有意圖去偷或拿走任何人的傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember the color, the shape of the umbrella you took at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得是藍色的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the item not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is that umbrella filled with blue on the surface?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我認知中，它是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '認知' which means 'cognition' or 'perception' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory' or 'remembrance'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can somebody prove what you have said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的我的教授與兩位朋友可以為我證明，我教授甚至想要借我他的傘，因為教授的傘比較小，怕會因此而淋濕，因此沒有跟他借，我當時兩位同學都在那邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我的教授與兩位朋友可以為我證明' instead of '是的我的教授與兩位朋友可以為我證明'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '證明' is incorrectly translated as 'prove' instead of 'accompany'. The correct translation should be 'My professor and two classmates can accompany me' instead of 'My professor and two classmates can prove for me'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the professor offered to lend their umbrella. The correct translation should include this detail.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds unnecessary information about the professor's umbrella being small. This detail is not mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the reason for not taking the professor's umbrella was to prevent the professor from getting wet. The correct translation should include this detail.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Then, the professor and two of your friends can come to the court to prove what you have said, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'can' should agree with the plural subject 'the professor and two of your friends'.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Then do you have any case for court to investigate for your evidence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著把傘還她，並且對她道歉，但她都無法接受，我相信我的教授與兩位朋友能夠到庭證明我的清白，還有證明我說的都是事實。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我相信我的教授與兩位朋友能夠到庭證明我的清白' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我相信我的教授與兩位朋友能夠證明我的清白到庭。'

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
I see. Now I’ll ask Miss Chen for what...for the case at that time.Miss Chen, could you explain what happend at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I visited the Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was rainy that day, so after I went into the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. When I came out of the museum, it was gone! I ask the assistance from the museum to help me to find my umbrella, but after that I saw this foreigner hold my umbrella. When I realized he was holding my umbrella, I ask him angrily why he stole my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was rainy? And didn’t he have any kind of…
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'stole' instead of 'took' to describe the action of the foreigner taking the umbrella.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'assistance' instead of 'assistance' in the sentence 'I ask the assistance from the museum'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention whether the museum staff found the umbrella or not.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's tone in questioning the foreigner's actions may be considered impolite or confrontational in some cultures.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
 What’s the color of your umbrella? And does it has any…features?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'your' before 'umbrella'.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'it' before 'has'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user's translation lacks a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day was blue. It’s dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
 Let’s look at the exhibition 1. Now you see the picture is that umbrella belong from you ?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is just very common. Everyone can buy that in 7-11, the convenience store. How could you so confidence that is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '很普通的那種' as 'just very common' instead of 'the kind that is very common'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '照片中' which means 'in the picture'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, that’s true my umbrella was brought at 7-11, but the button of my umbrella has some broken. It is hard to push it…push the button. I have explained this for the police when I was at the police station. And also, the accused… the umbrella accused at that time has this feature, so that was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'the umbrella accused'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in 'the accused... the umbrella accused'

omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'to push' after 'hard'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'the' before 'police station'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'the' before 'umbrella accused'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'that' before 'was my umbrella'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the accused is regretted about his behavior also apologize with you, could you just forget this case? In case this is just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊的只是一把傘' as 'this is just an umbrella', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'is regretted' instead of 'regrets', resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it is just an umbrella? It is a very important sense of humanity. Do you know at that day if I don’t have an umbrella, you tell me that I just walk in the rain and go home without an umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has subject-verb agreement errors.

I see, we will send the ticket to subpoena the witness for the next procedure and our procedure was set at 3:00 pm June 25th 2018. The accuser and the witness have to come to the court. The accuser, is this time available for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I will be here.
是的我到時候會出庭
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我會到時候出庭'.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, the accuser, you can…decide whether you want to come to the court next time because our next procedure was mainly to ask the witness of the accused to explain the whole situation at that time.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of classmates and teachers who were present with the accused on that day.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'to explain the whole situation at that time' in the wrong position in the sentence.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why would Ms. Chen say that you steal her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
在那天，我和我同學一起去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽，看完展覽之後，我的同學跟我說，他們有點餓，於是我們想出去買些吃的，甚至是找個地方能讓我們來吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，我發現正在下雨，而我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想說我要跟我的同學借一把傘，因為我的體型比較高大，所以我想像我的朋友Adam借傘，因為他的體型跟我差不多，於是我拿著傘和教授和兩個同學去買麵包，當我回來時，陳小姐就在那裏對我大吼。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我和我同學一起去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽' is incorrect. It should be '我和我的同學一起去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽'.

grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after '因為他的體型跟我差不多'. It should be '因為他的體型跟我差不多，於是我拿著傘和教授和兩個同學去買麵包'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Well, do you meant that the umbrella you borrowed was from your friend, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '同學' as 'friend' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我當時以為我拿的雨傘是Adam的。我並沒有想要偷別人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我以為我拿的雨傘是Adam的' instead of '我當時以為我拿的雨傘是Adam的'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Then, did you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you take at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you remember the color and shape of the umbrella that you took that day?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，那把傘是藍色的，而且不是一把很新的傘。

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the umbrella wholly in blue?

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的記憶裡，那支傘是藍色的。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anyone could verify your statement?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，當我和我的教授和兩位同學離開博物館時，我的教授還打算把他的傘借給我，而因為他的傘比較小，所以我沒有跟他借，因為我不想讓他淋濕，而我另外兩名同學也在場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '當我和我的教授和兩位同學離開博物館時' should be '當我和我的教授和兩位同學從博物館離開時'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Then, three of them could come to the court and help you verify what you just stated, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想應該是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any evidence that would like the court to help you investigate?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我嘗試把傘還給陳小姐，但他不接受，我也嘗試向陳小姐道歉，他也不接受。或許我的同學和教授能幫我證明我今天所說的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我嘗試把傘還給陳小姐" is incorrect. It should be "我嘗試把傘還給陳小姐".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我也嘗試向陳小姐道歉" is incorrect. It should be "我也嘗試向陳小姐道歉".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Ok, now I would like to ask Ms. Chen about what happened at that day. Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened at that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
At that particular day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was raining. I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack in the front door. And when I come back, the umbrella was gone. I asked the museum staff to help me find the umbrella, and I saw this foreigner put the umbrella back on the rack. When I realized the umbrella he took was mine, I was very angry；I ask him “Didn’t he know it was raining out there? Did he even has any conscious? “
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the speaker's anger and frustration.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Please describe the color and the shape of the umbrella that you brought to the museum at that day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the museum in their translation.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
Well, the umbrella I took to the museum was blue. I believe it was in the deep blue color.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now, I would like to show Exhibit 1 page 5. Is the umbrella on this picture yours?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'show' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '偵卷' as 'Exhibit' instead of 'page'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '照片' as 'picture' instead of 'photo'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '妳的' as 'yours' instead of 'mine'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is merely a regular umbrella. It is the kind of umbrella that you could easily get in a 7-11 store. How could you be so sure that this is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '很普通的那種' as 'merely a regular umbrella' instead of 'a very ordinary one'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?' which asks how the speaker is certain that the umbrella belongs to them.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, of course, I bought my umbrella at 7-11 store. However, the button of my umbrella is a little bit broken so that it cannot be packed properly. I explain this point to the Police specifically at that time, and the umbrella that the foreigner put back on the rack matched the description. So I believed that was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'I explain this point to the Police specifically at that time' should be 'I specifically explain this point to the Police at that time'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then, if the defendant has showed remorse and apologize to you. Would you be willing to forgive him? Because it is merely an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by using the word 'defendant' instead of 'opposite party'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error by using 'has' instead of 'have'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the opposite party's willingness to apologize.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the opposite party's remorse.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user's possibility of forgiving the opposite party.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the stolen item being an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it is only an umbrella? I think this is a basic moral issue. If he didn’t return the umbrella, how would I be able to go home? What? Did he want me to go home under pouring rain?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'only', which changes the meaning of the sentence. The correct translation should be 'what do you mean'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'he didn’t return' instead of 'he didn't return'. The verb 'didn't' should be contracted with 'he'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'I think' in the translation, which changes the tone and meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'What?' in the translation, which is an important part of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Well, I understand. We will subpoena the three of the witnesses of the case. Next court proceeding will set on June 25th 2018 at 3:00 P.M. Three of the witnesses and the defendant must come to the court. Is the date ok for the defendant?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect date

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會出庭。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Ms. Chen, the next court proceeding, you could come or not because the main procedure is about asking questions to the three witnesses.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the witnesses being classmates and teachers who were present with the defendant.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not needing to come.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟我的兩位同學去看展覽，在我們看完以後，我同學他們覺得很餓，所以我想說我們去買些食物，找個地方來吃晚餐。當我們要離開博物館時，外面正在下雨，我當時沒有帶雨傘，我就跟我同學借一把。因為我有點身材有點高大，所以我跟我同學亞當借雨傘，因為他的體身形比較寬，跟我比較相似。於是我從雨傘架上拿了雨傘，我去幫我教授們買了麵包，我回來之後就看到陳小姐對著我大叫。

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想要把雨傘還給陳小姐，但她並不接受。我也想要跟她道歉，但她也不領情。我想我的教授跟我的兩位同學可以幫我做證吧。

Ok, so I would like to ask Mrs. Chen what happened on that day. Mrs. Chen, could you tell me what happened on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
 I went Yingee Ceramics Museum that day, it was raining, so I put my umbrella in the rack. After I came out, my umbrella was gone. I ask the janitor of the museum to help me find it. But after I saw this foreigner, and I saw my umbrella. When I discovered that my umbrella was taken by him, I was so angry. I ask him why did you take my umbrella? Do you know it’s raining outside now? How can you behave like this? Do you have any moral ethics?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	鶯歌博物館 (Yingee Ceramics Museum) should be translated as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in 'I ask the janitor of the museum to help me find it' should be 'I ask the museum janitor to help me find it'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the umbrella was stolen
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the user confronted the foreigner about taking the umbrella
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention the user's anger and questioning of the foreigner's behavior
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention the user's questioning of the foreigner's moral ethics

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What’s the color of your umbrella, and did it have any special features?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day is blue, I guess it’s a dark blue umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '應該是深藍色的' as 'I guess it’s a dark blue umbrella', which doesn't accurately convey the meaning of '應該' (should).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please show the exhibit one. Mrs. Chen, is that the umbrella you brought that day?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the exhibit number and the page number.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'show' before the noun phrase 'the exhibit one', which is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'Mrs. Chen' instead of '妳' (you), which is a mismatched translation.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it was the umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture was just a common one. And you can buy it form anywhere like 7-11. How can you be so sure that it was yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
That’s true, that was the umbrella I bought from 7-11, and there are some damages around the button on the umbrella. At that time, I told the police about the damage on the button, and it was put on the rack, after which was taken by this guy.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was put back on the rack before being taken by the foreigner.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then, if the other party would like to apologize, and he knew that he was wrong. Could you forgive him since it was just an umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. The original text asks if the speaker would be able to forgive the other person, while the user's translation assumes that the speaker is asking if the interpreter would be able to forgive the other person.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What did you mean that it’s just an umbrella? Do you know that what the situation was? It’s raining big outside. Did you want to go back home without any umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the meaning of '只是' (just)

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Oh, I see. Well, I will send the subpoena to the three witness, and the next proceeding will be set at 3:00p.m., june 25th, 2018. The defendant and three witness will come to the court. The defendant, is the date ok with you?

Mrs, Chen, you can either show up or not on that day since we are going to ask three witnesses about what happened that day.

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The incident happened on May 27th, 2018. The defendant Paul Anderson took Xiao-Cian Chen’s umbrella at Yingge Ceramics Museum. The defendant did not inform the accuser of taking her umbrella. When the defendant returned the umbrella to Xiao-Cian Chen, she caught the defendant on spot.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The defendant, where were you at 4:15p on May 27th, 2018?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you the accuser Xiao-Cian Chen on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see the accuser Xiao-Cian Chen on that day?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是，當我把雨傘放回去的時候，原告陳小倩在場。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'was' should agree with the subject 'Ms. Chen', so it should be 'Ms. Chen was there.'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened on that day?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她當時大叫說我偷了她的雨傘，但我只是錯拿了雨傘而已。我有試著要道歉，但她不願意聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "但我只是錯拿了雨傘而已" is incorrect. It should be "但我只是錯拿了雨傘而已，並沒有偷走。"

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did the accuser said you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'accuser' was used instead of '陳小姐' (Miss Chen).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和同學們去看展覽，看完展覽後有兩個同學說肚子餓了，我們決定去買晚餐，或是找個地方坐下來吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，發現下大雨了，我原本想和我的同學借傘。因為我的個子比較高、比較大隻，所以我決定和我的同學亞當借傘，他的身形和我比較像。我就從架子裡面拿了傘，然後和其他人去買麵包，當我回來的時候，原告陳小姐就對我大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我和同學們去看展覽' should be '我和同學們去看展覽' instead of '我和同學們去看展覽'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '去買晚餐' should agree with the subject '我們' and be '去買晚餐' instead of '去買晚餐'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '當我回來的時候' should be in the past tense and be '當我回來的時候' instead of '當我回來的時候'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '麵包' should be translated as '食物' instead of '麵包'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean the umbrella you borrowed at the time belongs to your classmate Adam.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the umbrella belongs to the classmate, while the original text only mentions that the umbrella was borrowed from the classmate.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對我以為我拿的雨傘是亞當的，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember what’s the color and pattern of the umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色是藍色的，然後不是很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the car not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
The whole umbrella is blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的記憶裡，它是藍色的。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anyone can prove what you just stated is true?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有，當我出來的時候，我的教授和兩位同學都在，我教授原本還想要幫我撐傘，但是我覺得教授的傘太小了，我也不想要教授淋濕，其他兩位同學也在場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我的教授和兩位同學都在' instead of '我教授和兩位同學都在'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '撐傘' is not the correct word choice for 'lend me her umbrella'. The correct word should be '借給我她的傘'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the professor offered to lend the umbrella. This detail is important for understanding the context.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three people can come to the court and prove what you stated is true, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any other evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
當時我試著要還她傘，但她不願意拿；當時我也試著要道歉，但她不願意接受，我相信我的教授和兩位同學，都可以證明我所述為實。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我相信我的教授和兩位同學，都可以證明我所述為實' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我相信我的教授和兩位同學都可以證明我所述為實。'

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Then I am going to ask Ms. Chen about what happened on that day.Ms. Chen could you describe the situation on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened on that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day. It was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack and when I get back, it was gone. I asked the workers in the museum to find for me and the foreigner just took the umbrella back. When I saw my umbrella in his hand, I was really angry. I asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining on that day? How could he do such an immoral thing?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'get' instead of 'got' in the sentence 'When I get back, it was gone.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊' as 'gone' instead of 'stolen'.
inappropriate cultural transformation	ignoring cultural taboos or sensitivities	The user used the term 'immoral' to describe the foreigner's action, which may not be culturally appropriate.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What the color of the umbrella you took with you on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I took on that day was blue, dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Exbit1. Page5. The picture of the umbrella. Does the umbrella belong to you ?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'exhibit' which is important for understanding the context.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'belong' instead of 'belongs' to match the subject 'umbrella'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s exactly my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
It’s a really normal umbrella. It’s sold at 7-11. How can you be so sure that it’s your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought this umbrella at 7-11. But my umbrella has some problems at the button. It’s kind of broken. It cannot really buckle up. When I reported this case, I did emphasize this to the police officers. And the umbrella he put back on the rack has this characteristic too.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged at the button.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'kind of broken' in an incorrect position.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was put back on the rack by a foreigner.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella has a specific characteristic that matches the user's umbrella.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant does show his regret and he apologizes sincerely. Would you consider forgiving him? Since it’s just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by it’s just an umbrella? It’s an immoral thing. If he did not return the umbrella back, then I would have to get wet in the rain.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '只是一把傘' is translated as 'it's just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean by it's just an umbrella?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' is translated as 'if he did not return the umbrella back' instead of 'if he did not return it that day.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of '這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題' which means 'it's a question of whether a person has basic morals.'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Ok, I understand. Then I would send subpoena to the three people just mentioned. The next proceeding is at 3:00pm on June 25th, 2018. The defendant and there witnesses have to come to the court. Is the date fine with you, the defendant?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I will be here.
是的我會到庭。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
About the accuser, Ms. Chen, the next proceeding you can be here or you can choose not to come here. The next proceeding is mainly about asking the three witnesses about the defendant’s statement. You can choose to come or not to come.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the three witnesses who will be asked about the defendant's statement.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the accuser's presence being optional.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, or I need to take another leave.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
And at that time did you see the accuser, Miss Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把雨傘還回去時，陳小姐就在那裡。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐就在那裡，當我把雨傘還回去時。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大叫並說我偷了她的雨傘，當時的我只想解釋，我並沒有偷她的傘，我只是拿錯把。我嘗試向她道歉，但她不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '當時的我只想解釋' should be '我當時只想解釋'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和同學一起去看鶯歌陶瓷博物館的展覽。當我們看完那些物品之後，他們說覺得很餓，想要買食物來吃，所以我們想找個地方用晚餐。當我離開的時候，卻發現已經在下雨了。然後我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想跟同學借一把，我想要和我一位叫做Adam的朋友借雨傘，他的身型跟我的很像。所以我從架上拿一把傘然後跑去找我的教授跟朋友。當我回去的時候，陳小姐就在那裡。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
So is that umbrella belonging to your friend, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我以為那把傘是亞當的。我並沒有打算要偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我以為那把傘是亞當的' instead of '我以為那把傘是亞當的。'

是的，當時我的教授跟同學都可以證明這件事，我的教授甚至要借我一把傘。因為教授的傘很小一把，我不想要讓她淋濕，而且當時也還有同學在場。

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
I supposed that these three classmates can come to the court and prove what you’ve said, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

事情發生的時候，我想要把雨傘還回去然後跟她道歉但她不聽。也許我的同學跟教授可以證明我說的都是事實，

I see. Now I’m going to ask questions to Miss Chen to understand what happed at that day.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
Miss Chen, could you tell me that what happened that day? I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day. And… it rained at that time. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack. And when I was out, it was missing. I asked the staff in museum to find my umbrella for me. And then I saw this foreigner put my umbrella back. When I found my stolen umbrella, I was super angry. And I ask that why did he take my umbrella. Don’t you…know that there is raining outside?

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought at that day is blue. I think it’s dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '藍色的' as 'blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now we look at Exhibit one, page five. The picture on it. Is that umbrella yours?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is that umbrella yours?' instead of 'That umbrella is yours?'

對，就是這把傘。
null

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
This umbrella is normal. Everybody can buy it in 7-11 convenient store. How did you make sure that it is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '很普通的那種' as 'normal', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '普通' in this context.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question word '怎麼' which is crucial for understanding the question being asked.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed I bought that umbrella in 7-11 convenient store. But my umbrella, the button is broken. It’s not work well. I talked to the police on this point especially and this umbrella’s button is broken. So I could make sure that is my umbrella.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the broken button when talking to the police, which is an important detail in the original text.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant shows his regretness and he is willing to apologize to you, would you forgive him? It’s just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
How could you say that it just an umbrella? It is the principle of merit. It rained heavily outside. If he did not put the umbrella back, I would get wet. I won’t forgive him. Ever.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'it's the principle of merit'.

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?

Today we are mainly going to clarify what happened that day, so please answer the questions I ask so the prosecutors can understand what actually happened that day. Understand?

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen?

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有，我把雨傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐就在那裏。

當時發生了什麼事呢?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著解釋我應該是拿錯傘了' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試著解釋我應該拿錯了傘'.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'her' instead of 'Miss Chen'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'say' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和幾個同學到博物館看展覽，看完展覽之後，有些人說他餓了，所以我們決定出去買些吃的，也順便找在哪裡吃晚餐。要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了，但是我沒有帶傘，所以我決定要跟同學借一把傘。因為我身形比較高大一點，所以我決定跟我的同學，他叫亞當，我決定跟他借傘，因為他的身形跟我差不多。所以我從傘架上拿了把傘，然後出去買麵包，跟我的教授和兩位朋友一起，而當我走回去傘架的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大叫。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean the umbrella you borrowed is from your friend, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '亞當' as 'Adam' instead of 'friend'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我以為那把傘就是亞當的，我並無意偷別人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Then did you remember what color the umbrella you took was?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得它是…我只記得它的顏色，藍色，而且沒有很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not being a brand new one.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
The whole umbrella is blue?

In my recollection, the color was blue.
我印象中傘是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the noun '藍色' (blue color), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '藍色的傘' (blue umbrella).

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有的，我走出博物館的時候，一位教授和兩位同學都在我旁邊，教授甚至還想借我她的傘，但是教授的傘比較小，所以我沒有跟她借，我不想讓教授淋濕，其他兩位朋友在旁邊也有看到。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我走出博物館的時候，一位教授和兩位同學都在我旁邊'.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想可以吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any evidence that you want the prosecutor offices to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我當時試著把傘還給陳小姐，她不接受。我試著跟她道歉，她也不聽。我想我的教授和兩位同學應該可以到庭作證我說的都是事實。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我試著跟她道歉，她也不聽'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Ok. Next, I am going to ask Ms. Chen about what happened that day. Ms. Chen, can you describe what had happened that day?

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is an ordinary one. You can get it in a convenience store. How can you determine that it was your umbrella.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the part about the umbrella being the same kind that can be bought at 7-11.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought it at seven-eleven, but the button of my umbrella is a little broken. When I report the case to the police, I have explained this point. And the umbrella which the foreign returned back to the rack has the same feature. From this, we can know that it was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And the umbrella which the foreign returned back to the rack has the same feature.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged near the button.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context that the umbrella was reported to the police.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外國人' as 'the foreign', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '報案' as 'report the case', which is not the most accurate translation. It should be 'report to the police'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '特徵' as 'feature', which is not the most accurate translation. It should be 'characteristic' or 'trait'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant regrets it and is willing to apologize, would you forgive him? After all, it was just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by it was just an umbrella? It’s about moral. If he didn’t return the umbrella back, I would have to go home in the heavy rain! I wouldn’t forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'it was just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean by it was just an umbrella'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'What do you mean by it was just an umbrella?' instead of 'What do you mean by it was just an umbrella?'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' which means 'if he didn't return it that day'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Oh…ok. Then the court will subpoena the defendant’s professor and the two friends. The next proceeding is set to be at 3 p.m., June 25th, 2018. The defendant and the three witness should be appear in the court…should appear in the court. Defendant, would this date be ok?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'should appear in the court'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of sending subpoenas to the three individuals mentioned by the defendant.

Yes, I will be here.
可以，我會到庭。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The plaintiff, the next proceeding, you can either come or not come. Next time we will mainly ask the defendant and his professor and two classmates, so either you come or not is ok.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Next time we will mainly ask the defendant and his professor and two classmates, so it is ok whether you come or not.'

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
Then I won’t come. I would have to take a day-off if I come.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not coming in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user added the phrase 'I won't come' which is not present in the original text.

25th floor no.4 …no.132 學府Road Sanxia District 新北 City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The defendant Paul Anderson, on the date of May 27th 2018, in the location is Yingge ceramics museum, you were found to take the accuser, 陳小倩 小倩陳’s umbrella, and you didn’t tell her that you took the umbrella, and umm when you returned the umbrella, umm 陳小倩 found you and her umbrella, so she decided to sue you.

The defendant and the accuser please answer questions to help us clarify the situation on that day. Do the both parties understand? After that, I will ask the accuser about some details on that day. Do the both parties understand today’s procedure?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (took the accuser, 陳小倩 小倩陳’s umbrella)

I understand.
我了解

我了解。
I understand

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The defendant, on the date may 27, 2018, at 4:15 pm, where were you at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At the time, did you see the accuser Miss Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see Miss Chen, the accuser, at the time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的, 當我把雨傘放回傘架, 陳小姐在場

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大吼, 說我偷了她的雨傘, 我告訴她我可能我一定是拿錯了雨傘, 我並沒有要偷她的傘, 我嘗試向她道歉, 但她不肯聽
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我可能我一定是拿錯了雨傘" is incorrect. It should be "我可能是拿錯了雨傘".
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb "偷" should agree with the subject "我", so it should be "我沒有偷她的傘" instead of "我並沒有要偷她的傘".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb "拿" should be in the past tense to match the context, so it should be "我可能拿錯了雨傘" instead of "我可能是拿錯了雨傘".
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after "我嘗試向她道歉" to separate it from the following clause.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Miss Chen say that you steal her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
我當時和我的同學在逛鶯歌陶瓷博物館, 在看展覽, 在看了一些展覽品之後, 我的同學告訴我說他們肚子餓了, 所以我們想要出去買一些食物, 然後找個地方吃晚餐, 當我們正要離開的時候, 我意識到已經下雨了, 但我沒有帶雨傘,所以我像我的同學借了把傘, 因為我長得又高又大, 所以我決定借一把傘和我的體型比較相似的, 然後我就跟我的同學艾登借了把傘, 因為她跟我的體型最接近,
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我當時和我的同學在逛鶯歌陶瓷博物館' should be '我和我的同學當時在逛鶯歌陶瓷博物館'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '在看了一些展覽品之後' should be '在看了一些展覽品後'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我意識到已經下雨了' should be '我意識到已經下雨了'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '但我沒有帶雨傘' should be '但我沒有帶傘子'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '所以我像我的同學借了把傘' should be '所以我向我的同學借了把傘'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '因為我長得又高又大' should be '因為我又高又大'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '所以我決定借一把傘和我的體型比較相似的' should be '所以我決定借一把和我體型比較相似的傘'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '然後我就跟我的同學艾登借了把傘' should be '然後我就跟我的同學艾登借了把傘'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You are saying that the umbrella which you borrowed is from your friend, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '同學' as 'friend' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的, 我當時認為我借的傘就是我朋友艾登的, 並沒有要偷傘的意圖
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation incorrectly assumes the name 'Adam' is translated as '艾登' in Chinese, which is not a common Chinese name. The cultural transformation is inappropriate.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Then, do you so you still remember the color and the shape of the umbrella which you borrowed?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得那把傘的顏色, 它是藍色的, 但不是全新的一把傘
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '的一把傘' at the end of the sentence instead of after '藍色'.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is that umbrella was whole blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'was' is used instead of 'is', changing the tense and meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is that umbrella whole blue?' or 'Is that umbrella all blue?'

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的回憶裡, 它是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '在我的回憶裡', which means 'in my memory', but the original text means 'according to my memory'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is that anyone who can prove that what you were saying was ….is true?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的, 當我走出博物館的時後, 我的教授和另外兩個同學就在我的身旁, 我的教授甚至提議要借我她的雨傘, 因為她的傘太小了, 所以我就沒有和她借傘, 因為我也不希望她淋濕, 然樓另外兩個同學也和我在一起
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '當我走出博物館的時後' should be '當我走出博物館的時候'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So, these three people…can they can come to the court and be your evidence to prove what you said was right, can they?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Then do you what any evidence that want the prosecutor to help you investigate on your behalf?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我嘗試要歸還那把雨傘, 但是這個陳小姐不肯接受, 我嘗試道歉, 但這位陳小姐不想聽, 也許我的教授和我的同學可以證明我所說的都是真的
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我嘗試要歸還那把雨傘' should be '我嘗試歸還那把雨傘'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我嘗試道歉' should be '我嘗試向她道歉'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '但這位陳小姐不想聽' should be '但這位陳小姐不想聽我'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '也許我的教授和我的同學可以證明我所說的都是真的' should be '也許我的教授和我的同學可以證明我今天所說的都是真的'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Now I am going to ask Miss Chen the details on that day. Miss Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. I put the umbrella on the rack. and.. After I want to take my umbrella, it was gone. I asked the staff of the museum to help me find the umbrella, and I found this foreigner put my umbrella back to the rack. When I realized the umbrella which he took was mine, I was really angry, and I asked him why he took my umbrella, didn’t he know that it is raining outside?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part where the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'want' instead of 'went' in the sentence 'After I want to take my umbrella'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '鶯歌博物館' as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' instead of 'Yingge Museum'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'and' at the beginning of the sentence 'and.. After I want to take my umbrella, it was gone.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the part where the user asked the museum staff to help find the umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the user's anger in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the user's question to the foreigner about why he took the umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the user's comment about the foreigner's lack of public morality.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Miss Chen do do you wtill remember the color of your umbrella? Does it have any particular part?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'do' should agree with the subject 'Miss Chen', so it should be 'Does Miss Chen'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Do you still remember'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella which I brought that day I think id blue, and it’s dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '應該是深藍色的' as 'and it’s dark blue', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '應該' (should).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Show the evidence on the investigatory file P.5. Is this umbrellas yours?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'evidence' in their translation.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is my umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '這把傘' as 'my umbrella' instead of 'this umbrella'.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
In the photo, the umbrellas is quite ordinary one, which can easily get in 7-11. How do you ensure that this is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '照片中這把傘是很普通的那種' as 'In the photo, the umbrellas is quite ordinary one'. The correct translation should be 'In the photo, this umbrella is the ordinary kind.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'is' before the subject 'umbrellas' in the sentence 'the umbrellas is quite ordinary one'. The correct word order should be 'the umbrella is'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, my umbrellas was bought at 7-11, but the button of my umbrellas was broken. Umm um, it can not umm bottom up. At this point…umm on this point, when I report to the police, I have told the police um what my umbrellas look like, and the umbrella which the foreigner put back has the same same ….specialty.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'the umbrella which the foreigner put back has the same same ….specialty' does not make sense in English.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
The accuser, if the other party feels regret, and want to apologize, could you accept his apology? Since this incident is quite small.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it is just an umbrella? It’s a problem related to ethics. If the one he didn’t return my umbrella, I would have to umm I would have to walk without umbrella in the raining day, and I will get wet.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
Ok, I understand. The court is dismiss. Please sign the court script before you leave this court.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum, and I found that it was raining outside. When I get into the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. And then when I came out of the museum, I found that my umbrella disappeared. I ask the staff of the museum help me to find my umbrella, but when I went out of the museum, I found that there was a foreigner putting my umbrella back.When I found that it is the foreigner that took away my umbrella, I was mad.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

對，就是這把傘。

The umbrella in this picture is very ordinary. It is the kind of umbrella that you can buy in 7-11. How can you be sure that it is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the part about the speaker's ownership of the umbrella.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。

Ms. Chen, if the defendant have the sincerity of regression, and he is willing to apologize to you, then would you accept his apology? After all, it is just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it is an umbrella? I think that it is about a person’s basic moral. If I didn’t have a umbrella that day, that means I’m going to be wet on that big raining day. I don’t want to accept his apology.

Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的印象中，雨傘是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'color' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

Can anyone verify what you stated?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，當我一走出陶瓷博物館之後，我的教授還有其他兩個學生都有看到。我的教授甚至問我需不需要借他的傘。但因為教授的傘太小了，我並沒有向他借傘，我不想要他淋濕。當時其他的兩位同學都在。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我的教授還有其他兩個學生都有看到' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我的教授和其他兩個學生都看到了'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor offered to lend their umbrella. The correct translation should include this detail.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the unnecessary information '問我需不需要借他的傘'. The correct translation should be '問我需不需要借她的傘' to match the gender of the professor.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Could the three of them verify your statement?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想應該可以。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence you want the prosecutor to investigate?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我嘗試要還傘給他，但他拒絕了。我嘗試向他道歉，但他也不聽。或許我的教授和朋友能夠作證，他們會支持我的說法。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence should be '我嘗試還傘給她' instead of '我嘗試要還傘給他'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Now I would like to ask the accuser Xiao-Chiang Chen some questions. Ms. Chen, can you stated what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Museum at that day, and it was raining, so I put my umbrella in the rack. However, when I came out of the museum, I could not find my umbrella. I asked the museum staff to help me find my umbrella. After that, I saw a foreigner took my umbrella. When I realized that he took my umbrella, I was very angry, so I asked him “Do you know it is raining outside? Why did you take my umbrella? Don’t you have any sympathy?”
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'I went to Yingge Museum at that day' is incorrect. It should be 'I went to Yingge Museum that day'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the umbrella was stolen. Instead, it states that the foreigner 'took' the umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the user's question about why the foreigner took the umbrella and their comment about the lack of sympathy.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What is the color of the umbrella? Is there any special feature on your umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color is your umbrella?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day is blue. I think it is dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Show investigatory file 1 page 5. There is a picture on this page. Is this your umbrella?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '提示' as 'show' instead of 'refer to' or 'look at'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'is' before the subject 'the picture', resulting in incorrect word order.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture is really common. It is the umbrella you could buy in 7-11. How can you know that this is the umbrella that you brought?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '妳的' as 'that you brought' instead of 'yours'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, the umbrella I brought is from 7-11. However, the button of my umbrella is a bit broken. When I filed the case, I have specifically told the police about this point. The umbrella the foreigner took also has the same feature.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged at the button.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the accused seems to be genuinely regretful and apologize to you, will you accept his apology since this is just an umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that this is just an umbrella? This is something about basic moral ethics. If he did not return my umbrella, do I have to walk home all wet? I do not want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just' instead of 'something about'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'this is' before 'something about' instead of after
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'if he did not return my umbrella'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I see. We will subpoena the three witnesses, the two students and the professors, to state the details of the incident. The next proceedings will be at 3 pm on June 25th, 2018. The accused and the three witnesses will attend the court. The accused, is this time available for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The accused and the three witnesses will attend the court.'

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我可以到庭。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss. Chen, it is up to you whether you want to come to the court for the next proceedings. The purpose for the next proceedings is to ask the three witnesses about the incidents.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the witnesses being classmates and teachers who were present with the defendant.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
I will not come to the next proceedings since I will have to take a day off for my work.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for needing to take a day off.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

新北市三峽區學府路132號5樓之4
25F.-4, No.132, Xuefu Rd., Sanxia Dist., New Taipei City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The defendant, Paul Anderson, you are prosecuted of a stealing case. The time was 5/27 in 2018. The location was Yingge Ceramics Museum. On that day, you took the accuser, Xiao-Qian, Chen’s umbrella. However, you didn’t tell him. After that, you turned back the umbrella. And Xiao-Qian, Chen found you and the umbrella. So, you are prosecuted. Today we are going to understand what happened on that day. So, please answer the question based on our question. Understand? Afterwards, I will also ask some questions for the accuser. So, do both parties understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (took the accuser, Xiao-Qian, Chen’s umbrella) should be translated as 借了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (borrowed the accuser, Xiao-Qian, Chen’s umbrella)
omission or addition	omitting important details	因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下 (because you didn’t tell him) is omitted in the translation

I understand.
是的，我了解。

我了解。
I understand.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The defendant, where were you at 4:15 P.M. on 5/27 in 2018?

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you see the accuser, Ms. Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you see Ms. Chen, the accuser, at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把傘還回傘架的時候，陳小姐在那邊。

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
當時她朝著我吼叫，說我偷了她的傘，但是我嘗試著解釋，我只是拿錯傘，不是偷她的傘，我想要道歉，想要解釋，但是她都不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'yelled' is translated as '吼叫' which has a stronger connotation than 'yelled'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker tried to apologize.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Ms. Chen consider you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐會說' as 'consider' instead of 'say'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽，然後看完展覽之後，我跟我兩個同行的朋友就說肚子很餓，想要出去找一些食物吃，但是當我們要走出博物館的時候，才發現突然下雨了，但是我身上又沒有帶傘，然後打算向我朋友借一把，因為我身材比較高大，所以我決定跟我朋友亞當借傘，因為他身形跟我類似，於是，我就從傘架上拿了那一支傘，然後想說待會買一點東西，馬上就歸還，當我回到現場的時候，陳小姐就對著我吼叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '然後看完展覽之後' is incorrect. It should be '然後我們看完展覽之後'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '說' should agree with the subject '我們', so it should be '我們說肚子很餓' instead of '我說肚子很餓'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '想要' should be in the past tense to match the context, so it should be '想要出去找一些食物吃' instead of '想要出去找一些食物吃'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun '我們' is missing in the sentence '但是當要走出博物館的時候'. It should be '但是當我們要走出博物館的時候'.
grammar and structure	preposition errors	The preposition '向' should be '跟' in the sentence '然後打算向我朋友借一把'. It should be '然後打算跟我朋友借一把'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after '然後想說待會買一點東西' to separate it from the following clause.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
So, do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed at that time was your classmate’s, Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我以為我當時借的傘就是亞當的，我根本並沒有想要去拿別人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為我借的傘就是亞當的'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember what was the color and the shape of the umbrella you borrowed that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，蠻舊的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the car not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the umbrella all blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的印象當中，它是藍色的沒錯。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation adds the phrase '沒錯' which means 'correct' or 'right'. This addition changes the meaning of the sentence and implies that the color being blue is a correct or accurate statement, which is not conveyed in the original text.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is anyone can prove your words you just said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，當那天走出來的時候，教授和其他兩個同學都在場，教授甚至說要借我傘，但是那把傘好像太小了，所以我就跟她講，可能要向另外一個同學借傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我就跟她講，可能要向另外一個同學借傘' is incorrect. It should be '我就跟她說，可能要向另外一個同學借傘'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the professor's umbrella was small, which is mentioned in the original text.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So, the three people can be court to prove what you just said, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I guess so.
是的。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
So, do you have any evidence you want the police to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想要把傘還給陳小姐，但是她都不接受，我也想誠心地跟她道歉，但是她也都不聽，我想我的教授跟其他兩位同學應該能替我作證吧。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我想要把傘還給陳小姐' (I want to return the umbrella to Ms. Chen). The correct word order should be '我想把傘還給陳小姐'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我也想誠心地跟她道歉' (I also want to sincerely apologize to her). The correct word order should be '我也想跟她誠心地道歉'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'today' in the sentence '我想我的教授跟其他兩位同學應該能替我作證吧' (I think my professor and two other classmates should be able to testify for me today).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'what' in the sentence '我想我的教授跟其他兩位同學應該能替我作證吧' (I think my professor and two other classmates should be able to testify for what I have said today).

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK, now I am going to ask some details to Ms. Chen on that day.Ms. Chen, could you elaborate what happened on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Could you elaborate on what happened on that day?'

That day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. However, it was rainy. So, when I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack. However, when I wanted to leave, I found my umbrella gone. I asked the museum staff to help me, at the same time, I found the foreign turn my umbrella back. When I realized that the umbrella he took was my umbrella, I was really angry. Did he know it was rainy? So, how could he take my umbrella away?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '鶯歌博物館' as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' instead of 'Yingge Museum'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'the foreign' before 'turn my umbrella back' instead of 'the foreigner turned my umbrella back'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part where the speaker asked the foreigner why he took the umbrella.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What’s the color or other features of the umbrella you brought that day?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjectives 'dark' and 'blue' in the wrong order.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Show the evidence 1, page 5. In the picture, is your umbrella?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'this' before 'picture', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'is' instead of 'are' to agree with the plural noun 'umbrella'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is very common. It can be found in every convenience store. How could you make sure the umbrella is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the umbrella can be found in every convenience store, while the original text does not mention this.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I bought my umbrella in 7-11 convenience store. However, the button of my umbrella is kind of broken. So, I can make sure that’s my umbrella. At that time, I said to the police, and the umbrella the foreign turned back the button of the umbrella was also broken. So, I can make sure he stole my umbrella.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? It’s a matter of our values and moral. On that day, if he didn’t turn back my umbrella, so do you want me to go home without umbrella? I didn’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'it's just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean it's just an umbrella'.

25th floor, No.132, Xuefu Road, Sanxia District, New Taipei City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The incident happened at May 27th ,2018. The defendant Paul Anderson stole the umbrella of the accuser, Xiao-Chien Chen. You didn’t ask whether you can borrow the umbrella or not, and when you put the umbrella back, the accuser caught you red-handed. Today’s procedure is to clarify the details happened that day. Please answer my questions according to my saying. Do both parties understand? Later, I will also ask the accuser the details of this case. Do both parties understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the date as 'May 27th, 2018' instead of 'May 27th, 103'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the defendant took the umbrella without asking.

I understand.
我了解。

我了解。
I understand.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The defendant, where were you at 4:15pm on May 27th , 2018?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you see the accuser, Ms. Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you see Ms. Chen, the accuser, at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把雨傘還回架上後，陳小姐就在那邊了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐就在那邊了' instead of '就在那邊了陳小姐'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened then?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她站在那邊對我大叫，說我偷了她的傘，我告訴她我只是不小心拿錯而已。我沒有偷。我試著向她道歉，但她不接受。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '她站在那邊對我大叫' is incorrect. It should be '她對我大叫站在那邊'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我只是不小心拿錯而已' is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as 'I just accidentally took the wrong one.'

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Ms. Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed then was from your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '亞當' as 'Adam' instead of 'classmate, Adam'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的。我以為當時那把傘是我同學亞當斯的。我並沒有意圖要偷那個傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'steal' was translated as '偷' which means 'to steal' in Chinese, but in this context, it should be translated as '拿' which means 'to take'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Could you recall the color of the umbrella you took then?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色而已。是藍色的然後沒有很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the item not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Was the umbrella all blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我印象中是藍色的沒錯。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' before the adjective '藍色' instead of after it.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone proof what you just said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，可以。當時我和我的教授和兩位朋友離開博物館時，我教授甚至還問我要不要借我雨傘，因為她雨傘太小，我就不打算跟她借了。我不想要她淋濕。我那兩位同學當時也在場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我教授甚至還問我要不要借我雨傘' should be '我教授甚至還問我要不要借她的雨傘'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
I assume that the three of them can come to the court and clarify your statement, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate on your behalf?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我當時試著還給她雨傘，她不收。我跟她道歉，她也不接受。我想我的教授們跟兩位同學都能幫我做證這點。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我想我的教授們跟兩位同學都能幫我做證這點'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
I see. Now I’m going to ask Ms. Chen what happened that day.Ms. Chen, can you tell me what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Can you tell me what happened that day, Ms. Chen?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day. It was raining outside. So when I enterd the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack, and then I found out it was gone. I asked the members of the museum to help me find my umbrella. I found out that this foreigner took my umbrella. I realized the umbrella he was taking is the one I lost. I was very angry. How could anyone do such thing when they know it was raining outside?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out critical context

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Ms. Chen what is the color and the feature of your umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
My umbrella was dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Page 5 of the investigatory file… the evidence used in the case, is the umbrella yours?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the photo in the original text.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that was my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on that photo was a very common one. It was an umbrella anyone can get at 7-11. How can you proof that it was your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '確定' as 'proof' instead of 'confirm'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, it was brought from 7-11. My umbrella is kind of broken because the button of the umbrella doesn’t work well. I told the police this feature of my umbrella. And when the foreigner put back the umbrella, that umbrella did has this kind of feature.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'My umbrella is kind of broken because the button of the umbrella doesn’t work well.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after 'feature' in the sentence 'And when the foreigner put back the umbrella, that umbrella did has this kind of feature.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of reporting the issue to the police, which was present in the original text.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the other party is willing to apologize and he is regretful, will you forgive him? Since it was only an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it was only an umbrella? It was something about integrity. If he didn’t bring back my umbrella, I have to walk back to my home without an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Oh… okay, I see. I will subpoena his professor and two of his friends to the court. The next proceeding will be at 3pm June 25th. The defendant, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, I will be here.
可以，我可以到庭。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The accuser, Ms. Chen, you can choose to come to the court or not. Basically, we will just ask questions of his friends and professor.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about asking questions of the accuser if she chooses to come to court.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No. I am not going to come. I don’t want to take a leave.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'No' at the beginning of the sentence, which changes the meaning of the statement.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. This is the end of today’s procedure. Please sign the court script before you leave.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the instruction for the interpreter to leave the seat after signing the court script.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把雨傘放在後面的架子的時候有看到她。

當時發生了什麼事呢?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
當時陳小姐就對我大叫，說我偷了她的雨傘，但是我沒有偷阿。我試著道歉，但是她不接受，她也不聽。

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
When does Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那時候我跟我同學一起去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館的展覽。當我們看到了某兩件東西的時候，我的同學就說他有點餓，想吃點東西，所以我們就去外面尋找可以吃晚餐的地方。當我在博物館的時候，外面下著大雨，我當時就想說先跟我同學借把傘好了。因為我的體型比較高壯，那我就想說我的同學Adam身形也是這樣，所以我決定借了他的傘。當時我就拿了架上Adam的傘去買了麵包給我的教授和同學。當我回來的時候，陳小姐看到我就馬上大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '當我們看到了某兩件東西的時候' is incorrect. It should be '當我們看到某兩件東西的時候'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
The defendant, do you mean that you borrowed Adam’s umbrella at that time, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly refers to the defendant as 'the defendant' instead of 'you'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user places the verb 'mean' before the subject 'defendant', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我當時認為我拿了亞當的傘，我並沒有要偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我當時認為我拿了亞當的傘，我並沒有要偷任何人的傘。'

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我記憶當中，那把傘就是藍色的阿。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'color' as '傘' (umbrella) instead of '藍色' (blue color).

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，可以證明我的言詞的就是我的教授和同學，當時我和教授和同學一起出去買東西，然後教授也想借我傘。因為她的傘比較舊，所以我就沒有拿她的傘。當時我的教授和同學也都知道。

我覺得可以啊。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

Ok, now I’m going to ask the plaintiff, Miss Chen.Miss Chen, can you tell me about the process of the incident?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Miss Chen, can you tell me what happened that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum in that day and the weather is rainy, so when I came into the museum, I put the umbrella on the rack… but after I’m going to left the museum, I found that my umbrella is missing.I asked the worker of the museum and they found there is a person put back the umbrella.When I found that the defendant took my umbrella, I was very angry because the weather was rainy, I just thought this person had no kind heart.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What was the color and characteristics of the umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
I remembered that my umbrella is blue…oh…deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'deep blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Investigatory file 1 page 5, is that photo your blue umbrella?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'blue' in the translation.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella is very ordinary and it may be bought in the 711 convenient store on that photo. How can you say that this is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the umbrella is 'very ordinary' instead of '普通的那種' which means 'ordinary type'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, this umbrella was bought in the 711 convenient store and the button of the umbrella has some problems.When I report the incident to the police, I emphasized that feature…… and the foreigner did take the umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged and couldn't be buttoned properly.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the fact that they explained the umbrella's condition to the police.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user didn't mention that the foreigner returned the umbrella to the umbrella stand.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
The plaintiff, if the defendant has the regret and sincerely apologizes to you, could you forgive the foreigner? Because it was not a big deal, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
This umbrella is not ordinary. If I just the foreigner, in other words, it means that at that day I have to undertook the rain, so I don’t want to forgive the person?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of 'just'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'have to return it'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Ok, we will subpoena the three people to come to the court at 3 p.m. on 6/25 and the defendant and other witness should come to the court. Is that date, Ok, the defendant?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the date is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not to come to here at the nest proceeding. In that day, I just want to ask the professor and classmates about the process of the incident.

新北市三峽區學府路132號5樓之4
Floor 25 to 4, Xuefu Rd., Sanxia Dist., New Taipei City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The time was at May 27, 2018. The incident happened at Yingge Ceramics Museum in New Taipei city. You took Hsiao-Chien Chen’s umbrella without her permission. You were caught by her with her spot, and thus she pressed charges. Today’s procedure is mainly to understand what happened that day. Answer my questions so that we can understand the details of the incident. Do you understand? Later I’ll also ask the accuser about what happened that day. Do both understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '造訪' as 'visited' instead of 'took'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase 'The time was at May 27, 2018' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you at 4:15 pm. At May 27th 2018?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'accused' before 'defendant'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase 'at 4:15 pm' after the question instead of before.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the present tense 'were' instead of the past tense 'were'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'in' before 'May 27th 2018'.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see Ms. Chen?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'you' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'did' instead of 'do' in the translation.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，我把傘放回傘架的時候，就看到她了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我看到她了' instead of '就看到她了'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
And what happened then?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對我大叫，說我偷了她的傘。我試著跟她說我拿錯傘了，並不是要偷，試著跟她道歉但她都不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '他對我大叫' is incorrect. It should be '她對我大叫'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我拿錯傘了' is translated as 'I must have taken the wrong one' which does not convey the meaning of 'I took the wrong one'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
And why Ms. Chen said you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'asked'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'said' before the subject 'Ms. Chen', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和幾個同學參觀博物館展覽，看完展覽之後，兩個同學說他餓了，所以就決定出去買東西，或許也找個地方晚餐。當我離開博物館，我發現外面下雨，但沒帶傘，所以想要跟同學借一把。因為我個頭較大，所以我決定去跟我一個朋友亞當借傘。他身形跟我差不多，後來我從傘架拿了傘，和我的教授和幾個朋友去買一些麵包。當我回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我吼叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我和幾個同學參觀博物館展覽' (I and a few classmates visited the museum exhibition). The correct word order should be '我和幾個同學參觀了博物館展覽' (I and a few classmates visited the museum exhibition).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以就決定出去買東西' (So we decided to go out and buy something). The correct word order should be '所以就決定出去買些東西' (So we decided to go out and buy some things).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '或許也找個地方晚餐' (Perhaps also find a place for dinner). The correct word order should be '或許也找個地方吃晚餐' (Perhaps also find a place to have dinner).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以想要跟同學借一把' (So I wanted to borrow an umbrella from my classmates). The correct word order should be '所以想要跟同學借一把傘' (So I wanted to borrow an umbrella from my classmates).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '他身形跟我差不多' (His body shape is similar to mine). The correct word order should be '他的身形跟我差不多' (His body shape is similar to mine).

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean the umbrella you borrowed was Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你的同學亞當' as 'Adam's' instead of 'your classmate Adam's', changing the meaning.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我以為我拿的傘是亞當的，我並沒有要偷傘的意思。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'steal' was translated as '偷' which means 'to steal' in Chinese, but in this context, it should be translated as '拿' which means 'to take'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you took?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，是藍色，不是全新的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the object not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is it all blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
我印象中是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the adjective '藍色的' (blue), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '藍色的是' (blue is).

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anyone who can prove what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，我走出博物館的時候，教授和其他兩個同學都和我在一起，我的教授甚至借我她的傘。因為她的傘太小了，我沒辦法撐，又不想要她被淋溼。另外兩個同學也在那裏。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我沒辦法撐，又不想要她被淋溼' is incorrect. It should be '我又沒辦法撐，又不想要她被淋溼'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So those three people could help you to prove what you just said, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
What any else evidence do you hope the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著還陳小姐傘但她不要，跟她道歉她也不聽，也許我的教授和朋友可以證明我今天說的都是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著還陳小姐傘但她不要' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試著還陳小姐的傘但她不要'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '跟她道歉她也不聽' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我跟她道歉她也不聽'.
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after the word '也許' in the sentence '也許我的教授和朋友可以證明我今天說的都是真的'. The correct sentence should be '也許，我的教授和朋友可以證明我今天說的都是真的'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK, now I would like to ask Ms. Chen about the details of the incident.Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge museum. It was rainy. When I entered it, I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I came out, it was gone.I asked the staff to help me find it. Then I saw the foreigner take it back.When I discovered the umbrella he took was mine, I felt angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was rainy outside? How can somebody be so selfish?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'was' instead of 'were' to agree with the plural subject 'umbrella'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊' as 'gone' instead of 'stolen'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '質問' as 'asked' instead of 'questioned'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '公德心' as 'selfish' instead of 'public morality'.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What color was the umbrella you took? Is there anything special on it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella you took?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
What I took was blue. I think it was deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '藍色的' as 'blue' instead of 'deep blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Picture on the page 5of exhibit 1, is that umbrella yours?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'exhibit' which is important for context.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella is the ordinary one. That can be bought at 7-11. How could you be sure that umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker being in possession of the umbrella.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, that was bought at 7-11, but the button on my umbrella is a little bit damaged, a little bit hard to buckle it up.About this point, I have specially explained to the police. The umbrella that the foreigner took back had this feature. Therefore, I am sure that’s mine.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'a little bit hard to buckle it up' should be 'a little bit hard to buckle up'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'The umbrella that the foreigner took back had this feature' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text, which states that the foreigner put the umbrella back on the umbrella stand.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the user explained the damage to the police when reporting the case.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then I ask you, if the other party shows regrets and is willing to apologize, will you forgive him? After all, that is only an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean “only an umbrella?” that is a basic moral problem. Had he not returned the umbrella, I would have to walk home in the pouring rain? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'only' instead of 'what do you mean'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the question mark at the end of the sentence instead of after '只是一把傘'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題' which means 'this is a basic moral problem'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' which means 'if he had not returned it that day'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '難道要我淋大雨回家嗎?' which means 'should I have to walk home in the pouring rain?'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
OK, I see. We will subpoena the three witnesses just mentioned to ask them about what happened that day. The next court is set at 3 pm. on June 25th, 2018. The defendant and the three witnesses should be here. The defendant, is that date OK with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'The next court is set for June 19th, 2018, at 3 pm.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the year in the translation.

Yes, I will be here.
好的，我會到庭。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '庭' is translated as 'here' instead of 'court'.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Ms. Chen. The next court you can choose to be here or not. Basically people whom we’ll ask are the classmates and the professor who were with the defendant that day. If you would like to come, welcome.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The next court you can choose to be here or not.' instead of 'The next court you can choose to be here or not.'

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The defendant, the accuser, Miss Chen, she said the incident happened on May 27th, 2018 and the situation is that you took her umbrella and did not inform her (you took her umbrella without notification… of her) so when you returned the umbrella back, she caught you immediately, and so she reported the case to the police and then filed the lawsuit. So, today, the procedure will focus on what you did that day, and the defendant, we need you to tell us what happened on that day and answer our questions, do you understand? And then, after you, we will ask the accuser what happened on that day, do you both parties understand the procedure?

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The defendant, where were you at 04:50… p.m. on May 27th, 2018?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the time expression is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you see the accuser, Miss Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you see Miss Chen, the accuser, at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把雨傘放回架子上，我就看到她了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我就看到她了' instead of '我就看到了她'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened then?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對著我大吼、大聲喊叫，說我是小偷，偷了她的傘，但我想我一定是拿錯把了。我有試圖道歉，但她不接受。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation uses a cultural expression that does not match the original meaning.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why would Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我和我同學一起去博物館看展，當我們看完所有的展品時，我有兩…我其中兩個同學覺得很餓，所以我們決定找個地方吃晚餐。當我們要離開時，外面下雨了，可是我剛好沒有帶雨傘，所以我想跟我同學借傘。因為我身材比較高大，所以我向我其中一位同學，亞當，借傘，他的身形跟我比較像。於是我就從架子上 借 了一把傘，然後和我的教授跟我同學一起去買食物這樣，當我們回來後，陳小姐就對著我們大吼。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the phrase '我其中两个同学觉得很饿' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我其中两个同学觉得很饿'.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the phrase '然后和我的教授跟我同学一起去买食物' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '然后和我的教授跟我同学一起去买食物'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Are you saying that the umbrella you borrowed was… did it belong to your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '亞當' as 'Adam' instead of 'classmate, Adam'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對阿，我以為那把傘是亞當的傘啊。我真的沒有有意要去偷人家的東西。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'steal' is not an accurate translation for '偷'. It should be 'take' or 'borrow'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember what… the shape and the color of the umbrella… you took?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色是藍色而已，而且不是很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the car not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Was the umbrella all blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我印象中，應該是，沒錯。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Could anyone prove your word?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
我想，有。當我們走出博物館時，我的教授跟我的兩個同學和我一起走的，我的教授甚至借了我她的傘。因為教授的傘比較小把一點，但我也不想讓教授淋濕，所以我就沒有借了。當時另外兩個同學也在場。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	借了 should be translated as 'lent' instead of 'borrowed'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the professor offered to lend the umbrella

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So, can the three people come to the court to verify your word?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
應該可以吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence do you need the prosecutor to help you investigate?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我有試著把雨傘還給陳小姐，也有試圖向她道歉，可是她都不肯接受。我想我同行的那三人可以幫我佐證我的話，告知整個事發的經過。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我想我同行的那三人可以幫我佐證我的話" is incorrect. It should be "我想那三個和我同行的人可以幫我證明我說的話".
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb "告知" should be in the form of "告訴" to match the subject "我同行的那三人".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the speaker tried to apologize to Ms. Chen.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Well, I see. Then, now the court is going to ask Miss Chen what happened on that day.Miss Chen, could you tell us what happened on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'is going to ask' should come before the subject 'the court'.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I remember that day I went to the museum. And before I got inside the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. And after I came out, it was gone. I ask for help from the faculty of the museum, and after that, I saw this guy put my umbrella back into the rack. When I found that it was… this guy took the umbrella that I thought was stolen, I questioned him… You didn’t know there was rain outside? Are you crazy? ......
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that it was raining when they went to the museum.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb tense in the question 'You didn’t know there was rain outside?' It should be 'You didn’t know it was raining outside?'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What is… what kind of umbrella did you bring with you that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
It was a blue umbrella I thought. Dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please show Exhibit on page 5, is that your umbrella?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'photo' in their translation, which is an important detail.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is the one.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture, it is the kind that we can buy from a convenience store. It’s really common. How can you recognize that it is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the 7-11 convenience store in their translation.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
It is true I bought the umbrella at a convenience store. And… there is something different with my umbrella. A button was broken. It can’t match… I told the police about the button things, and so… I found that this guy return the same umbrella with the same button problem, so I knew it was him stole my umbrella.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence 'I found that this guy return the same umbrella with the same button problem, so I knew it was him stole my umbrella.'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Well, if the other party has the sense… if the other party will apologize with regrets, can you forgive him? It was just only an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
An umbrella? What do you mean “an umbrella”? Do you know how the situation is completely out of control of moral? It was a rainy day. Heavy rain. Do you know the situation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Fine, the court will send the subpoenas to the three witnesses to ask them to came to the court to help us know more about the… what happened on that day. And the date of the proceeding is at 03:00 p.m. on June 25th, 2018. The defendant and the three witness must come to the court, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'to ask them to came to the court' is incorrect. It should be 'to ask them to come to the court'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The date 'June 25th, 2018' is translated as '103年6月19日', which is incorrect. It should be '2018年6月25日'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after 'the defendant' in the sentence 'The defendant and the three witness must come to the court'. It should be 'The defendant, and the three witness must come to the court'.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會出席的。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The accuser, Miss Chen, the proceeding, you can either show up or not. Actually, we… the court just needs to know about what happened on that day from the three witnesses.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
That won’t be necessary. I won’t came here. I won’t came to the court. I don’t want to take any day-off…
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in 'I won't came here' and 'I won't came to the court'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in 'I won't came here' and 'I won't came to the court'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of 'any' in 'I don't want to take any day-off'

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
Well, the court understand, and today’s investigation procedure is adjourned, and please both parties sign here, please. (sign the paper, please)
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'please sign the paper'.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you see the plaintiff, Miss. Xiaoqian Chen.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把雨傘放回架上的時候，我有看到她。

當時發生了什麼事呢?
Then what happened?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她大叫著說我偷了她的雨傘，我也嘗試跟她講說我並沒要偷他的傘，我只是拿錯傘了。我試著跟她道歉，但她不聽。

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Then why Miss. Chen said that you stole her umbrella?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'said' before the subject 'Miss. Chen' instead of after.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我跟幾個同學一起去博物館參觀一個展覽，到一半的時候，我同學突然說肚子餓了，所以我們決定出去買點東西，也許順便會吃個晚餐。當我們走出博物館的時候，我們發現外面在下雨，我沒有帶傘，所以當時想說要借我其中一個同學的傘。因為我比較高大，所以我想說借跟我差不多身型的艾登的傘，他的傘跟我的很像。然後我就帶著那個傘，還有我的教授跟兩個朋友一起去買東西，當我買了麵包回來的時候，就遇到了陳小姐，她就開始對著我大叫
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'yell at' as '大叫', which means 'shout loudly', but the correct translation should be '責罵' or '責怪', which means 'scold' or 'blame'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Well do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed is your classmate’s, Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '你同學亞當的' as 'your classmate's, Adam's' instead of 'your classmate Adam's'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我當時以為那把傘是我朋友的，我並沒有想要去偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為那把傘是我朋友的'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella you borrowed at…on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.

在我的印象中，它是藍色的。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，當時我離開博物館的時候有我的教授跟兩位同學跟我同行，其中我的教授甚至還說要救我他的傘。但是因為他的傘對我來講太小了，我不想要淋濕，所以就婉拒了，當時我另外兩個同學也在場。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'lend' as 'save'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect placement of '他的傘'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the professor's offer to lend the umbrella

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three people you mentioned they can come to the court and support what you said, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'can' should agree with the plural subject 'three people'.

I guess so.
我想是的

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
What else do you want the investigator…the prosecutor to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著要還陳小姐傘。但他不要；我也有試著跟她道歉，但她也不應。也許我的教授跟兩位同學能夠來佐證我今天所說的話都是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也有試著跟她道歉，但她也不應' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我也試著跟她道歉，但她也不應'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'return' in the sentence '我試著要還陳小姐傘'. The correct translation should be '我試著要還陳小姐傘給她'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day. It was rainy. And when I…when I was leaving the museum I…when I went into the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I was leaving the museum, I found my umbrella was lost I asked the staff in the museum for help, and at that time, I saw the foreigner tried to return my umbrella to the rack. When I found that the umbrella he took was the one that I lost, I was very angry. Didn’t she know…didn’t he know that the outside was rainy? How can he do that?

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought my umbrella in 7-11. But the bottom of my umbrella was a little bit broken, so I can…so I am sure that was my umbrella. When I reported to the police, I …I no…I mentioned this point. The umbrella like the foreigners returned to the rack, I found this on that umbrella.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the other party was regret and he was…is willing to apologize to you, will you pardon him? After all, it was only an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it was just an umbrella? It was the…the problem about his personality. If he didn’t return the umbrella, I will get wet and I couldn’t…I couldn’t go home. I do not want to pardon him.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那一天我跟班上的一些同學去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館的展覽。在我們看完所有展覽物品之後，我、的兩位同學說他們有點餓了，所以我們那時正想要出去找點食物，甚至就是找個地方吃晚餐。當我們正要離開博物館的時候，我發現外面下雨了，所以……因為我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟班上的同學借一把傘。因為我身…身形比較高大，所以我想說，我會向……艾登借傘。他…的身形跟我比較類似。所以我就從傘架上拿了一把傘。之後，我…就跟我的兩…教授和兩位同學去買了一些麵包。當我回來時，把傘放回傘架，陳小姐就對著我大叫。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	艾登 should be translated as Adam
grammar and structure	word order errors	The sentence structure is not correct in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	The reason for Ms. Chen yelling at the user is missing in the translation

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Did you mean that the umbrella you borrowed at that time was belonged to your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the sentence, resulting in a mismatched meaning.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我認為當時我拿的那把傘是亞當的。我完全沒有要偷別人傘的意思
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Then did you remember …the color and the shape of the umbrella you just …took that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得…傘的顏色是…藍色。它不是一個全新的傘。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '傘的顏色是' (the color of the umbrella is) after '我只記得' (I only remember), which resulted in a word order error.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '不是一個全新的傘' (not a brand new one) before '傘的顏色是' (the color of the umbrella is), which resulted in a word order error.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '不是一個全新的傘' (not a brand new one) as 'it is not a new umbrella', which does not convey the same meaning as the original text.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is that umbrella blue from the head to the bottom?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '整隻都是' as 'from the head to the bottom', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的印象中，它是藍色的。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Could anyone prove the thing you just mentioned?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有的。當我走出…博物館的時候，我的教授和兩位同學都跟我待在一起。我的教授甚至有問我說…要不要借我她的傘。但因為她的傘太小了，所以我並沒有…跟她拿，我不希望她ㄕ…就是…被雨淋濕。當時，另外兩位同學也跟我們待在一起。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'offered to lend' as 'asked if I wanted to borrow'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the reason for not taking the umbrella

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Then the above-mentioned three people could have come to the court to …prove what you said is the truth, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是的。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any evidence …that you want … the prosecutor to investigate on your behalf?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
當時我…有試著、向陳小姐解釋我並沒有偷她的傘，但是、她不聽我說；我也有嘗試向她道歉，但她也不聽我…道歉。我想，我的教授和兩位同學可能可以證實我說的話都是實話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我也有嘗試向她道歉，但她也不聽我…道歉。'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?

grammar and structure	word order errors	rearranged the sentence structure
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	used 'remember' instead of 'bring'
omission or addition	omitting important details	did not include the question about the umbrella's features

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I took with me that day was probably blue, and……I think it’s dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '應該是深藍色的' as 'I think it’s dark blue', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '應該' (should/must).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Show evidence 1, page 5. Is the picture on the page……the umbrella…on it belonged to you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is that umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'that' is used instead of 'this', changing the meaning.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on the picture is…… very, very normal. It is the one you can buy in a 7-11. How can you make sure that this is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'very, very normal' instead of 'very ordinary' to describe the umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'in the picture' which is important for understanding the context.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, my umbrella was bought in a 7-11. But my umbrella was a little broken on the part of the button; it cannot wrapped……very well.I have reported this… thing to the police at that time.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then would you like to forgive him if…ugh this person……has regretted for the whole situation and he also wanted to apologize. Because……in many ways, it’s just an umbrella!
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the person has regretted for the whole situation, while the original text only mentions regret and willingness to apologize.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the sentence 'Because……in many ways, it’s just an umbrella!'

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by “just an umbrella”? What would happen if he didn’t return the umbrella? Then I have to……go back home in heavy rain! I don’t even want to forgive him!
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'just a matter of an umbrella'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. Instead of 'Then I have to……go back home in heavy rain!', it should be 'Then do I have to go back home in heavy rain?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the person's lack of basic morality, which is an important detail in the original text.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The accused, where were you at 4:15 PM, May 27th, 2018?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you see the accuser, Xiao Qian Chen?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'accuser' is not an accurate translation for '原告' which means 'plaintiff'.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，我要把我的雨傘放回架上的時候，陳小倩在那裏。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小倩在那裏，我要把我的雨傘放回架上的時候。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對著我吼說我偷了他的雨傘，我試著告訴他我並沒有要偷他的雨傘，我應該只是不小心拿錯了。我試著向他道歉，但他聽不進去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '他對著我吼說我偷了他的雨傘'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'I must have taken the wrong one' as '我應該只是不小心拿錯了' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why would she accuse you of stealing her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'accuse' instead of 'say'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟同學去博物館看展覽，我們看完後，我其中兩個同學說他們餓了，我們就決定外出覓食，順便尋找晚餐要在哪裡吃。在我要離開的時候我發現下雨了，因為我沒有帶雨傘，所以我打算借一支我同學的雨傘。因為我比較高大，所以我決定借我同學亞當的傘，因為他跟我體型一致。然後我就從架上拿了一支傘，跟教授和同學去買了一些麵包，當我回來時，陳小姐就開始對我吼叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "在我要離開的時候我發現下雨了" is incorrect. It should be "我要離開的時候，我發現下雨了".
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence "因為我比較高大，所以我決定借我同學亞當的傘". It should be "因為我比較高大，所以我決定借我同學亞當的傘給我".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the protagonist borrowed the umbrella from the rack. The sentence "然後我就從架上拿了一支傘" should be included.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that Ms. Chen started to yell at the protagonist. The sentence "當我回來時，陳小姐就開始對我吼叫" should be included.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
The umbrella that you took belonged to your classmate, Adam. Is that what you’re saying?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the umbrella belonged to the speaker's classmate, Adam, instead of stating that the umbrella belonged to the user's classmate, Adam.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我當時以為我拿了亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the shape or the color that you took at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you remember what color or shape the umbrella you took that day was?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色。那是一支藍色的傘，並沒有很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the umbrella being an umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjective '藍色的' (blue) before the noun '傘' (umbrella), which is the opposite of the correct word order in Chinese.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的印象中，那支傘是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation adds the word 'umbrella' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can someone verify your statements?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有的，在我離開博物館的時候，我的教授和兩名同學都跟著我離開，我的教授甚至有提說要不要借我他的傘。但因為他的傘比較小，所以我就沒有借，因為我不想要他也被雨淋濕，當時另外兩位同學也都在旁邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
I assume that those three people can come to the court to verify your statement. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想應該可以。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any further evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'court' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我當時試著要還陳小姐她的傘，但是他不願意拿。我當時也試著跟他道歉了，但是他也不接受。也許我的教授跟同學到庭後，可以幫助證明我的說詞是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我當時試著要還陳小姐她的傘' is incorrect. It should be '我當時試著要還陳小姐的傘'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence '但是他不願意拿'. It should be '但是她不願意拿' to match the subject '陳小姐'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun '他' is used incorrectly in the sentence '我當時也試著跟他道歉了'. It should be '她' to refer to '陳小姐'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker tried to return Ms. Chen's umbrella. It should be included in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker tried to apologize to Ms. Chen. It should be included in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker's professor and friends will be able to prove the truth of what the speaker said. It should be included in the sentence.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
I see. Now let’s move on to Ms. Chen. I am going to ask you some questions regarding the incident happened on that day. Ms. Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day. It was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack outside. But when I got out of the museum, the umbrella was gone. I asked the staff members in the museum to help me find my umbrella. Afterwards, I saw this foreigner coming back with MY umbrella. When I realized that he was holding my umbrella, I was very angry. So I asked him, “Why did you take my umbrella? Didn’t you know that it was raining outside? How can someone be so impolite?”
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'have' instead of 'has' in the question 'Didn’t you know that it was raining outside?'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user used the word 'impolite' instead of 'lacking in public spirit' to describe the foreigner's behavior.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What was the color of the umbrella that your brought on that day? Were there any features?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella that you brought on that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The color was blue. It was probably a dark blue umbrella.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the umbrella being dark blue.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Show exhibit number one. Please look at page number five. Is the umbrella on this picture yours?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is the umbrella in this picture yours?'

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s the one.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture is a very regular umbrella. It’s the kind of umbrella that you can buy at any 7-11 convenience store. How can you be so sure that it’s your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的那種' as 'regular umbrella' instead of 'ordinary kind'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
It’s true that I bought my umbrella in 7-11. However, my umbrella has some damage in the button area. I told the police about this feature when I was filing for this case. And the umbrella that the foreigner put back to the rack has the same features. Therefore, I can be sure that it’s my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And the umbrella that the foreigner put back to the rack has the same features.' The correct word order should be: 'And the umbrella that the foreigner put back on the rack has the same features.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user explaining the damage to the police when filing the case. The correct translation should include this detail: 'I explained this feature to the police when I was filing the case.'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
So, can you forgive him after he showed regrets? Because, at the end of the day, it’s just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it’s JUST an umbrella? This is a question of basic morals. What if he didn’t bring back the umbrella that I had to go home in the rain? I do not want to forgive him AT ALL!
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'JUST', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '只是' in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'he didn’t bring back' instead of 'he didn’t bring it back', resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '一個人有沒有基本道德的問題' which is an important detail in the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I see. The court will subpoena the three witnesses that the accused mentioned. The next proceeding is set at 3 PM, on June 25th, 2018. The three witnesses and the accused should all be here on that day. The accused, is this date okay with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the date is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The year is missing in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the mention of the accused being required to attend the court hearing.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會到庭。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The accuser, you can choose to be here or not for the next proceeding. Basically, we’ll be asking question to the three witnesses that the accused mentioned. You can be here if you want. Do you understand?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the accuser is Chen Xiaojie.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'Do you understand?' at the end of the sentence instead of at the beginning.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
That won’t be necessary. I do not want to take another day off.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of having to take another day off.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. This is the end of today’s proceeding. Please leave after you sign the court script.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'promise' should be in the present tense to match the present situation. It should be 'I promise to faithfully and honestly translate or interpret.'
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after the word 'stated' in the sentence 'I promise to faithfully and honestly translate or interpret what is stated in this court.' It should be 'I promise to faithfully and honestly translate or interpret what is stated in this court.'

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?

Afterwards, I also will inquire the accuser about the detail of that day’s situation. Do both parties understand?

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'happened' should agree with the singular subject 'the case' instead of 'the time'. It should be 'The case happened on May 27th, 2018.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'giving back the umbrella' should be 'returning the umbrella'.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you see the accuser, Mr. Chen Miss. Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'Miss Chen' instead of 'Mr. Chen Miss. Chen'.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟我的同學是到鶯歌博物館鶯歌陶瓷博物館去參加一場展覽，當展覽看完之後，其中一位同學說肚子有點餓了，所以我們就打算去找一些東西吃，或許找一些東西當作晚餐。當我要走出鶯歌陶瓷博物館時，外面下雨了，我沒有帶我的傘，所以我就想說要從我朋友那邊借一支。因為我長得比較強壯一點，所以我就想說要從我的朋友艾登那邊借一支傘，因為他的身形跟我比較相似。所以我就從架上拿出拿走了一把傘，然後跟我的兩位朋友跟教授一起去吃午一起去買晚餐，當我們回來時，我就看到陳小姐在那邊對者我大叫。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	鶯歌博物館 (Yingge Museum) was translated as 鶯歌陶瓷博物館 (Yingge Ceramic Museum)

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you took is your friends Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '同學' as 'friends' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我當時以為我拿的傘就是亞當的。我並沒有意思要拿要偷走任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為我拿的傘就是亞當的。'

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember do you remember that what is the color of the umbrella you took that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

When I was about to leave, my umbrella I cannot I couldn’t find my umbrella. I asked the staff in museum to help me find the umbrella. Then, I saw the foreigner returning back my umbrella.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is that was my umbrella.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought that umbrella in a 7-11, but the button on my umbrella is a little bit broken so that so… When I reported to the police, I have already explained that. The umbrella the foreigner returning back also own the feature of a broken bottom, so I can make sure it is my umbrella.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '有沒有可能' as 'is that any chance', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the accuser Miss Chen?

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展，我們看完展後，我們都覺得很餓，就決定出去買些食物。當我要離開博物館時，我發現外面正在下雨，而我並沒有帶傘，於是我就想跟我的一位同學借傘。因為我的個子比較高，身型較大，我就跟我的朋友亞當借傘，他的身形跟我很像。之後我就從傘架拿一支傘，和我的教授以及其他同學去買些麵包。當我們回來時，陳小姐看到我拿她的傘就開始對我大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '當我要離開博物館時' is incorrect. It should be '當我要離開博物館的時候'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我當時試著要還陳小姐她的傘，但她不接受。我試著跟她道歉，她也不聽。也許我的教授和朋友們可以佐證我今天講的話都是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我當時試著要還陳小姐她的傘'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Now I’m going to ask Miss Chen what happened that day. Miss Chen could you please describe what happened that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
That day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack. However, when I came out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staffs of the museum to help me find the umbrella. Then, I saw this foreigner took my umbrella. I was angry, so I asked he why did he take my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How could he do that to me?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that it was raining when they entered the museum.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'he' instead of 'he did' in the question 'why did he take my umbrella?'.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day was blue. Dark blue, maybe.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is just the ordinary one, the one you can buy from 7-11. How can you be so sure that it is yours?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '很普通的那種' as 'just the ordinary one' instead of 'the kind that is very common'. This results in a cultural transformation as the user assumes the umbrella is ordinary based on its appearance, while the original text implies it is common based on where it can be purchased.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought it from 7-11. However, the button part was a little broken, and the umbrella can’t be closed. When I reported the case to the police, I mentioned this point. The one that the foreigner took had the same feature, so I was sure that it was mine.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was unable to be closed due to a broken button.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '扣不太起來' as 'the umbrella can't be closed' instead of 'the button can't be fastened'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Would you like to forgive the other party if he is regretful and willing to apologize? After all, it is just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it is just an umbrella? This is an issue of morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, I would have got wet when I went home. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just', which does not convey the intended meaning of '什麼叫做「只是」一把傘?'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. Then, we will subpoena the three witnesses that were mentioned before. We will ask them to come to the court to explain what happened that day. The next court date will be set at 3 pm June 25th 2018. The defendant, is the time okay for you?

Yes, I will be here.
是的我會到庭。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The accuser, Miss Chen, the next court date you can choose to come or not to come. We will ask some questions to the defendant’s classmates and professor.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The accuser, Miss Chen, can choose to come or not to come on the next court date.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the questions will be asked to the defendant's classmates and professor.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, I will have to take another day off.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. The court is rest. Please sign the scrip before you leave.

No. 4, Floor 25, No. 132, Xuefu Road, New Taipei City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The incident happened on May 27th, 2018. And the accused, Paul Anderson is accused of taking away an umbrella of the accuser Chen Xiaoqian. Because the accused didn’t inform the accuser that he took the umbrella, when he returned the umbrella, he was caught. Therefore the accuser decided to file a lawsuit against him. And the location was at Yingge Ceramics Museum. Today’s procedure is to find the reason of this case and let the prosecutor know what happened about the incident. Do you fully understand? Later I will ask the accuser what happened about the incident to fully understand this case. Do both parties understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And the accused, Paul Anderson is accused of taking away an umbrella of the accuser Chen Xiaoqian.' The correct word order should be: 'And the accused, Paul Anderson, is accused of taking away the accuser Chen Xiaoqian's umbrella.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the incident happened in 2018. This detail is crucial for understanding the timeline of events.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the location of the incident, which is the Yingge Ceramics Museum. This detail is important for understanding the context of the case.

I understand.
我了解。

我了解。

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The accused, where were you at 4:15pm on May 27th, 2018?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我当时在莺歌陶瓷博物馆。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time did you see the accuser Miss Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see Miss Chen, the accuser, at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，当我把雨伞还回去的时候，陈小姐在那里。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '当我把雨伞还回去的时候，陈小姐在那里。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她当时对着我大叫，说我偷了她的伞，我于是向她解释我可能是拿错了伞，并没有偷。我当时也试图给它道歉，但她并不接受。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我于是向她解释我可能是拿错了伞，并没有偷' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我于是向她解释，我可能是拿错了伞，并没有偷。'

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和同学去了莺歌陶瓷博物馆去看一个展览，看完展品之后，有同学说很饿想去吃东西，于是我们想去找一个吃东西的地方，和找个地方吃晚饭。当我离开博物馆之后，我看到下雨了，但是我并没有带伞，于是我就想说借同学的伞。因为我身材高大，所以我想借亚当的雨伞，因为他身材和我差不多。我从架子上拿了一把雨伞，然后就给教授和同学买面包，当我回来的时候，就发现陈小姐对我大喊大叫。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'Museum' as '莺歌陶瓷博物馆' which means 'Yingge Ceramic Museum' instead of 'Museum'. 
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '那天' (that day) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the classmates and the user visited the museum for an exhibition.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user went to buy bread with the professor and two other friends.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that Ms. Chen started to yell at the user after they came back.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed is from your classmate Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '亞當' as 'Adam' instead of 'your classmate Adam'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我当时觉得自己拿的是亚当的雨伞，我并没有被想要偷任何人的雨伞。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella' as '我并没有被想要偷任何人的雨伞', which means 'I didn't want to steal anyone's umbrella'. The meaning of 'didn't intend to steal' is not accurately conveyed.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you borrowed that day?

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只记得雨伞的颜色。它是蓝色的，然后并不是崭新的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the mention of the umbrella at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not being a brand new umbrella in their translation.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the umbrella all blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的印象当中，那个伞是蓝色的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'umbrella' from the translation.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone verify what your said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，当我离开博物馆的时候，我和一个教授和两个同学一起。教授当时甚至要借给我她自己的伞。因为她的伞太小了，我不想身上淋湿，所以没要她的伞，当时两个同学也在那里。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我和一个教授和两个同学一起' is incorrect. It should be '我和一个教授和两个同学一起' instead.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor and classmates were with them when they came out from the museum.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor offered to lend them her umbrella.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the other two classmates were also present.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Do you mean that all three of them can be present at the court and verify what you said, am I right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想应该是这样。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence you want the police to help investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我试图把伞归还给陈小姐，但她不要，我也试图给她道歉，但她也不接受，也许我的教授和同学能证实我说的是真的吧。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我也试图给她道歉" is incorrect. It should be "我也试图道歉给她".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK, let me ask you a few questions on what happened about the incident?Miss Chen, can you tell us what happened at that time on this incident?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
It was raining when I was going to the Yingge Ceramics Museum. And I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I was about to leave the museum, the umbrella was gone. I asked the staff from the museum to help me find the umbrella and I found that this foreigner returned the umbrella. I was quite angry the umbrella he returned was exactly the one that I have. I asked him why did he take my umbrella. How could he be so ethically irresponsible?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'have' instead of 'had' in the last sentence.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Miss Chen, what’s the color of your umbrella? Are there any characteristics of your umbrella?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be changed to 'was' to match the past tense of the original text.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I took that day was blue, dark blue I guess.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue I guess', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '應該是深藍色的' (should be dark blue).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Exhibit evidence one, page five. Does the umbrella on the photo belongs to you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'please' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the singular form 'belongs' instead of the correct plural form 'belong'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it belongs to me.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on the photo was quite ordinary that can even be bought everywhere like 711. How can you be so sure that the umbrella on the photo is yours?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '7-11' as '711', which is not the correct translation. '7-11' is a specific convenience store chain and should not be translated as a number.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
It is indeed bought at a 711-convenience store. But my umbrella has some problems with its buttons and it can’t be fixed. I explained to the police about this matter and the umbrella the foreigner returned on the rack also has problems with its buttons. So I think it’s exactly the same umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the fact that the umbrella was damaged at the button area.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the phrase '扣不太起來' as 'it can't be fixed' instead of 'the button can't be fastened'. The meaning of the original text is lost in translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the fact that the user explained the issue with the umbrella to the police.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation skips the mention of the specific characteristic of the umbrella that the foreigner returned on the rack also had button problems.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses the word 'rack' instead of '傘架' which means 'umbrella stand'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Would you forgive him after he apologizes to you and show his regrets? After all it’s only an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by just an umbrella. It’s a matter about moral qualities. If he did not return my umbrella, I would go in the rain and go home. I would not forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just an' instead of 'what do you mean by'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'It' after the verb 'mean' instead of before
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'if he did not return my umbrella' in the second sentence

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Ok, I understand. This court will subpoena three witnesses to the court. And the next proceeding will be at 3pm, June 25th, 2018. And the three witnesses shall be at the court for the proceeding. Are you ok with this date?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the date is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The original text specifies the year as 103, but the translation omits this detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not mention that the three witnesses are also required to attend the court proceeding.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not mention that the defendant is also required to attend the court proceeding.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'shall' should be 'should' to match the subject 'the three witnesses'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The translation uses the past tense 'were' instead of the future tense 'will be' to indicate the next court proceeding.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the specific time of the court proceeding, which is 3pm.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the specific date of the court proceeding, which is June 19th.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the year of the court proceeding, which is 103.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會到庭。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, for the next proceeding, you can either come or not because the next proceeding is mainly to ask questions to the professors and students. It’s okay for you to come to the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the plaintiff is Miss Chen.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'to the court' in the wrong position in the sentence.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, I will not be present at the next proceeding because I have to ask for a leave permit.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they will not be present at the next proceeding.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'have' instead of 'will'.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
Ok, I understand. This court is dismissed. Please sign the court script and then leave.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Please sign the court script and then leave.'

Abus Gashion先生，你102年09月15日在桃園中正國際機場停車場，拿了機車車牌KB405上的一頂男用帽子，之後經受害者報案、警方調閱停車場的監視器紀錄，經身分確認後，了解該行為是你所為。由於該行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，又經受害者提出告訴，你涉嫌犯竊盜罪。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎?
Abus Gashion, in year 102, September 15th, did you take a helmet from a motorcycle numbered KB405 in the International Taoyuan Airport in the parking lot? The owner of the helmet told us. We had a look at the videotape from the airport and found out the thief is you. Because you did that without telling the owner, you are… What we do today is to understand what happened on that day. Please answer what I just asked so that we can understand the process of the whole case. Do you understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of '拿了' as 'take' instead of 'stole'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form 'is' instead of 'was'
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing mention of the victim reporting the incident

I understand.
我了解了

那請問102年9月15日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Where were you in the year 102 on September 15th?

I was at CKS International Airport.
我當時在桃園國際機場
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the name of the airport, CKS International Airport.

你當時去機場做什麼呢??
What did you do in the airport?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
我去接一個來拜訪台灣的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我去接來拜訪台灣的一個朋友'.

所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
So did you pick up your friend at the terminal?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '航廈' as 'terminal' instead of 'airport'.

Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.
對，我搭公車去機場的，但我早到了，所以就在那邊等我朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那為什麼後來會發生你拿原告帽子這件事呢?
What happened to the case that you just stole someone’s helmet?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text.

I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.
噢，我在等我朋友，但是有點無聊，所以我就到處晃晃，消磨時間。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我在等我朋友，但是有點無聊，所以我就到處晃晃，消磨時間。'

你後來去了哪裡呢?
So where did you go at the end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I went to the parking lot for motorcycles.
我去停車場找機車。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我去機車停車場。'

然後發生了什麼事呢?
And what happened after that?

I saw a cap left on one motorcycle.
我看到一隻貓在一台機車上 (顆顆…沒聽清楚…)
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of translating 'cap' as '帽子' (hat), the user translated it as '貓' (cat).

(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?
Can you have a look? Is this helmet in the picture?

Yes, it is that cap.
對，就是那一頂。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'cap' is translated as '頂' which means 'top' or 'crown' instead of '帽子' which means 'hat'.

然後呢? 發生了什麼事?
And what happened?

Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
因為四下無人，所以我就把帽子拿走了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為無人四下，所以我就把帽子拿走了。'

你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?
Did you just said that you just took the cap?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I did.
痾，對。

你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?
Don’t you know that the cap belongs to others? You cannot just take it.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '隨便拿走' as 'just take it' instead of 'cannot just take it', changing the meaning.

I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
我真的很抱歉我的所作所為，我嘗試把帽子還擁有者但是…
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '還' should come before the object '帽子'.

所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎?
I just confirm it to you one more time.You were at the International Taoyuan Airport and because you saw no one there so you took the hat that didn’t belong to you.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the motorcycle parking lot in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the past tense 'were' instead of the present tense 'are' to describe the location of the incident.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '拿了' as 'took' instead of 'picked up'.

Yes, that’s what happened.
沒錯這就是事情的經過。

因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?
And now because the owner has accused you of that, would you like to have a talk with the owner?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me.
我嘗試要跟他道歉，但他不跟我講話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我嘗試跟他道歉' instead of '我嘗試要跟他道歉'.

沒關係，如果你有意願，我們會幫你跟原告進行和解，那先訂103年2月27日早上9點鐘進行調解，你可以到庭嗎? 如果一切順利，可能就會以金錢賠償的方式，結束這個案子，你明白嗎?
It’s okay. If you have the will, we will help you with the case. We’ll have you talk to the owner.So that’s have a deal. At 9am, February 27th, in the year 103, we will meet you here and have a talk with the owner. Is that okay for you?If all of these are okay for you, we are going to end this case with paying money. Do you understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning: 'have a deal' instead of 'have a settlement'
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversed word order: 'have you talk to the owner' instead of 'have the owner talk to you'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omitted mention of 'mediation' or 'settlement'

Abus Gashion先生，你102年09月15日在桃園中正國際機場停車場，拿了機車車牌KB405上的一頂男用帽子，之後經受害者報案、警方調閱停車場的監視器紀錄，經身分確認後，了解該行為是你所為。由於該行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，又經受害者提出告訴，你涉嫌犯竊盜罪。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎?

At 2013 september fifteen at four and….where are you at that time?

I was at CKS International Airport.
我那時後在cks 國際機場
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'cks' instead of 'CKS' in the translation.

I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
我去那邊接一個要來遊歷的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我去那邊接一個來台灣遊歷的朋友'.

所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
So you mean that you took..took up your friend at airport
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.
是的我是搭公車去機場那邊，後來我朋友來遲了我就在那邊等他
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我是搭公車去機場那邊' instead of '是的我是搭公車去機場那邊'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about arriving early at the airport.

那為什麼後來會發生你拿原告帽子這件事呢?
Then how could it happen that you steal victim helmet
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '原告' as 'victim' instead of 'plaintiff'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'steal' before the noun 'helmet', resulting in incorrect word order.

I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.
我在那邊等我朋友結果他來遲了我只好找些事情殺殺時間
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我在那邊等我朋友，結果他來遲了，我只好找些事情殺殺時間。'

你後來去了哪裡呢?
So where are you going next?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I went to the parking lot for motorcycles.

我看到一隻貓？在摩托車上…
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '貓' (cat) was used instead of '帽子' (cap).

(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '帽子' as 'helmet' instead of 'hat'.

Yes, it is that cap.
沒錯就是那帽子
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

然後呢? 發生了什麼事?
And then what happened next?

Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
因為那附近沒有人…我就拿了那個帽子
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我就拿了那個帽子' instead of '因為那附近沒有人…我就拿了那個帽子'.

你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?
You mean that you just took other's cap?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I did.
喔我就是阿
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '阿' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?
Don't you know that this cap belongs to other's, you cannot took it away.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'you cannot take it away' instead of 'you cannot took it away'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'took' is a past tense verb, which does not match the present tense of the original text. It should be 'take' instead.

I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
我很抱欠我知道這樣是不對的，所以我拿帽子來還人阿
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the object.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the cap was brought to the current location.

所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎?
Now i affirm…reaffirm you.so you at the parking lot in the airport,and you since you find nobody near by so you took the cap,right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, that’s what happened.

因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?

I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me.
我嘗試跟當事人道歉但是他不願意跟我說
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒關係，如果你有意願，我們會幫你跟原告進行和解，那先訂103年2月27日早上9點鐘進行調解，你可以到庭嗎? 如果一切順利，可能就會以金錢賠償的方式，結束這個案子，你明白嗎?

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user being at the airport. The correct translation should include 'at the airport' to provide the necessary context.

你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?

semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s what happened.
是的

因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '原告' as 'victim' instead of 'plaintiff'.

是的

Abus Gashion先生，你102年09月15日在桃園中正國際機場停車場，拿了機車車牌KB405上的一頂男用帽子，之後經受害者報案、警方調閱停車場的監視器紀錄，經身分確認後，了解該行為是你所為。由於該行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，又經受害者提出告訴，你涉嫌犯竊盜罪。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎?
Mr. Bushion. Did you take away the male helmet at the internation taoyuan airport on September 15 in the year of 2013? Then the victim called the policeThe police identified you by looking at the camera record.Because you didn’t inform the victim of your taking away his helmet, you are accused of theft.The process today is to understand what was happening on that dayPlease answer my questions in order to let us understand this issue better.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Abus Gashion -> Mr. Bushion
grammar and structure	word order errors	Did you take away the male helmet -> Did you take the male helmet away
omission or addition	omitting important details	September 15 in the year of 2013 -> September 15, 2013

I understand.
是的我明白

那請問102年9月15日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Where were you on September 15 in the year of 2013?

I was at CKS International Airport.
那時候我在中正機場
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of being 'at' the airport.

你當時去機場做什麼呢??
What did you do there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
我去那邊接拜訪台灣的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我去那邊接來台灣拜訪的朋友。'

所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
So you were saying that you picked a friend of you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.
是啊！我搭公車到機場，我早到了，所以我在那等我朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我搭公車到機場' instead of '我搭到公車機場'.

那為什麼後來會發生你拿原告帽子這件事呢?
Then why does the thing happen that you took away the victim’s helmet?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.
我在等我朋友啊，他的班機延誤了，所以我很無聊，我只好找些事情來做
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they went around to kill time.

你後來去了哪裡呢?
Then where did you go?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Where did you go then?'

I went to the parking lot for motorcycles.
我去機車停車場
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'parking lot for motorcycles' as '機車停車場' which means 'parking lot for scooters' instead of '機車停車場' which means 'parking lot for motorcycles'.

然後發生了什麼事呢?
Then what happened?

I saw a cap left on one motorcycle.
我看到一個棒球帽掉落在一輛機車上
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '棒球帽' (baseball cap) is not an accurate translation for 'cap' in this context.

(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?
Please take a look at the picture. Is this cap you saw?

Yes, it is that cap.
式的就是那頂棒球帽
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

然後呢? 發生了什麼事?
Then what happened?

Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
因為四下無人，所以我就帶走了棒球帽
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我就帶走了棒球帽' instead of '所以我就帶走了棒球帽'.

你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?
Are you saying that you took away others’ cap?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I did.
null

你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?
Don’t you know that the cap belongs to others? You can’t take others’ stuff.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text expresses surprise and disbelief, while the user's translation simply states a fact.

I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
我對我的所作所為很抱歉，我想要還給她原本的主人我今天也把它帶來了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我今天也把它帶來了。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '想要' is not the appropriate translation for 'tried to'. It should be '試圖' or '嘗試'.

所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎?
Then let me confirm you with the details.On the day, you were at the airport. Then you saw the cap. Because there’s no one around, so you just take away the cap, right?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect, resulting in a confusing sentence structure.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the motorcycle parking lot, which is an important detail in the original text.

Yes, that’s what happened.
這就是事發經過

因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?
Then the prosecutor is accusing you of stealing his stuff. Then do you have the will to apologize?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. The original text asks if the user is willing to apologize and reconcile, while the user's translation states that the prosecutor is accusing the user of stealing.

I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me.
我是過向他道歉，但是她都不理我
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'owner of the cap' is singular, so the verb 'wouldn't' should be 'wouldn't' instead of 'wouldn't'.

沒關係，如果你有意願，我們會幫你跟原告進行和解，那先訂103年2月27日早上9點鐘進行調解，你可以到庭嗎? 如果一切順利，可能就會以金錢賠償的方式，結束這個案子，你明白嗎?
Never mind, if you have the will, then we will help you reconcile with the prosecutors.So how about we make the reconciliation on the day of February 27th. Are you available at the time?If things goes well, then we can end this case with payment.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'So how about we make the reconciliation on the day of February 27th' is incorrect. It should be 'So how about we make the reconciliation on February 27th?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'we can end this case with payment' does not accurately convey the meaning of '以金錢賠償的方式' which means 'in a way of compensating with money'.

I understand and I will be here.
我了解，我會準時到的

好，那我們會通知原告，如果日期不能配合，我們會再通知你，可以嗎? 如果沒有問題，就請你那天準時到本棟四樓的調解室，明白嗎?
Then we will let the prosecutor know about this stuff. If the time isn’t stuitable for him, we’ll let you know.Is this okay with you?If you don’t have problems with this, then please come to the 4th floor. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Then we will let the prosecutor know about this stuff.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'If the time isn’t stuitable for him, we’ll let you know.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after the phrase 'If the time isn’t stuitable for him'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'to the mediation room on the 4th floor' in the sentence 'then please come to the 4th floor.'

I saw a cap left on one motorcycle.
我看到一輛機車上有一頂安全帽…鴨舌帽。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'cap' as '安全帽' (safety helmet) instead of '鴨舌帽' (cap).

(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?
Now, please look at the picture in this file, is the cap in this picture the one you took?

Yes, it is that cap.
沒錯就是那頂帽子。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'cap' is translated as '帽子' which is correct, but the word '頂' is unnecessary and not present in the original text.

然後呢? 發生了什麼事?
Then what happened?

Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
因為沒人在場，所以我拿走了帽子。

你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?

沒錯我拿了。

你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我很抱歉拿了他的帽子'.

所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎?
All right, that’s clear all things again. That day, you were at the parking lot, because no one was there and you saw that hat, so you took it, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'That day, you were at the parking lot, and because no one was there, you saw that hat and took it, right?'

Yes, that’s what happened.
沒錯，這是事情的經過。

因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?
Now because you are accused by the owner, do you want to make a deal with the owner?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me.
我試著向帽子的主人道歉，但是他不願意和我說半句話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是他不願意和我說半句話' instead of '但是他不願意和我說半句話。'

沒關係，如果你有意願，我們會幫你跟原告進行和解，那先訂103年2月27日早上9點鐘進行調解，你可以到庭嗎? 如果一切順利，可能就會以金錢賠償的方式，結束這個案子，你明白嗎?
That’s all right, if you have the will to apologize to the owner, we will help you. So, let’s appoint a meeting at 9:00 in …the February twenty seventh 103 year 9:00, is that ok with you? If everything go through successfully, then you just need to paid for the owner to solve this case.

Abus Gashion先生，你102年09月15日在桃園中正國際機場停車場，拿了機車車牌KB405上的一頂男用帽子，之後經受害者報案、警方調閱停車場的監視器紀錄，經身分確認後，了解該行為是你所為。由於該行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，又經受害者提出告訴，你涉嫌犯竊盜罪。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎?
So, the accuse.....On September 15, do you have the male helmet in the 桃園international airport’s parking lot for KB405.

What did you do in that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
我去那裡接我的朋友,他是來觀光的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我去那裡接來台灣觀光的朋友'.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The translation is too informal. It should be '我去那裡接來台灣觀光的朋友。'

所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
So you mean, you go to the platform?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.

I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.

I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
我真的很抱歉我拿了這頂帽子,我已經想要環他了,我今天也帶來啦
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我已經想要還他了' instead of '我已經想要環他了'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '環' is incorrect in this context. The correct word should be '還', which means 'return'.

所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎?
So, ok.. I will make sure. At that day, in the international airport parking lot, you took the cap because there are no others.

I understand.
我了解。

那請問102年9月15日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Please tell me where you were in September 15th at 4:15.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the specific year (102年) from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase (下午4點15分時) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.

I was at CKS International Airport.
我在中正機場。

你當時去機場做什麼呢??
What did you do in the airport?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
我去中正機場接機，去接一個來台灣玩的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我去接一個來台灣玩的朋友' instead of '我去中正機場接機'.

所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
So, did you pick up your friend at airport?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pick up your friend at the airport?'

Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.
我是搭公車到機場的，而且我提早到在那邊等朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我搭公車到機場'.

那為什麼後來會發生你拿原告帽子這件事呢?
But, why happened, why did you steal the cap?

I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.
我提早到了，但是因為朋友的班機延誤，所以隨意晃走來殺時間。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我提早到了' instead of '我到了提早'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '隨意晃走' in the translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'went around to kill time'. It should be translated as '四處走動' or '到處逛逛' to convey the idea of wandering around.

你後來去了哪裡呢?
So where did you go later?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I went to the parking lot for motorcycles.
我去了機車的停車場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我去了停車場的機車。'

然後發生了什麼事呢?
What happened later?

I saw a cap left on one motorcycle.
我看到一頂帽子留在摩拖車上。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '一頂帽子留在摩托車上' instead of '一頂帽子留在摩拖車上'.

(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?
Now please see the picture on the page 5. Is the cap is the same as the one you saw that day?

Yes, it is that cap.
對，就是那頂帽子。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'cap' is translated as '帽子' which is the correct translation, but the word '頂' is unnecessary and can be omitted.

然後呢? 發生了什麼事?
What happened later?

Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
因為那天沒人在旁邊，我就拿了那頂帽子。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'because' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '那天' (that day) before the verb '沒人在旁邊' (no one around), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '沒人在旁邊' (no one around) before '那天' (that day).

你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?
Did you just say that you took the cap?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I did.
對啊，我拿啦。

你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?
Didn’t you know that the cap is other’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
我對此事深感抱歉，我也想嘗試想把帽子還給原主，我今天就有帶那頂帽子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我今天就有帶那頂帽子。'

所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎?
Now I wanna make sure with you. So, you stole the cap when there was no one in the parking lot for motorcycles, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '拿了' as 'stole' instead of 'took'.

Yes, that’s what happened.
對，那就是那天的發生經過。

因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?
Now, the victim has accused you. Did you want to make a agreement with him?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me.
我有嘗試要跟他道歉，但他都不理我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有嘗試要跟他道歉，但他不理我。'

沒關係，如果你有意願，我們會幫你跟原告進行和解，那先訂103年2月27日早上9點鐘進行調解，你可以到庭嗎? 如果一切順利，可能就會以金錢賠償的方式，結束這個案子，你明白嗎?
That’s okay. If you have the willing to apologize, we will help you. So, we have arranged the date in February…….If everything is okay about the case, we will use money to solve the problem

Okay, later we will tell the victim. If everything is okay, we will tell you. Is that okay?If you don’t have any problems, at that day, we will deal with this problem on the fourth floor in this building. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'later we will tell the victim' should be 'later we will notify the plaintiff'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'If everything is okay, we will tell you' should be 'If everything is okay, we will notify you'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'at that day, we will deal with this problem on the fourth floor in this building' should be 'on that day, we will handle this matter in the mediation room on the fourth floor of this building'.

Abus Gashion先生，你102年09月15日在桃園中正國際機場停車場，拿了機車車牌KB405上的一頂男用帽子，之後經受害者報案、警方調閱停車場的監視器紀錄，經身分確認後，了解該行為是你所為。由於該行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，又經受害者提出告訴，你涉嫌犯竊盜罪。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎?
Mr. Abus Gashion, in 2013 September 15th, you were said to be stealing a helmet from a scooter with the number of KC1F5. So the one who lost his helmet called the police. The video tape was being scanned by the police officers, and they confirm that it’s stolen by you. By accepting the fact that the victim was no informed, the stealing case is confirmed. Today’s standard procedure is to have an idea of what happened that day. Please respond to my questions so the investigator can have a better understanding.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today we are here for the child rearing case between Ferry Johnson and Tasi-yun Shi. Can I ask both sides: do you hire lawyers?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the preparation procedure for the child rearing case.

我有委託律師。
Yes, I have a lawyer.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有律師。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today I want to know the two sides’positions with the child rearing case and I would know why each of you think you are the better side to keep this child. Please state the details especially at this point. Besides, I know this case also has divorce ongoing. So I hope the case of verbal attack does not happen.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Today I want to know the two sides’positions with the child rearing case' is incorrect. It should be 'Today I want to know the positions of the two sides with regard to the child rearing case'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'think' should agree with the subject 'each of you', so it should be 'thinks' instead of 'think'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the divorce case, which is an important detail in the original text.

I understand.
我了解了

了解。
Yes, I understand.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
I have few questions for the plaintiff. Why do you want to get the child rearing right for the kid? As I know, in Taiwan, you don’t have a full-time job and you are a foreigner. Why do you think you are more capable in the case of child rearing?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think you are more capable in the case of child rearing?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權' as 'get the child rearing right for the kid' is not accurate. It should be translated as 'seeking custody of the child'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the plaintiff not having a full-time job and being a foreigner, which is important context for the question.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望法院能判給我全部的撫養權，我有兩個原因。第一，我的妻子沒有再與我們同住了，我想要看著我的女兒長大。再者，我聽說我的太太與其他男人同居，如果這是真，我很疑惑他是否能給我們的女兒完整的照顧，因此我希望獲得撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我希望法院能判給我全部的撫養權' should be '我希望法院能判給我全部的撫養權'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
so do you mean because your wife is now going to divorce with you and at the same time she’living with another man and you also suspected her of living with another man. Is it because of this situation so you don’t want to leave your daughter to her, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，這些是我主要的顧慮。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
In addition, according to your financial status, if you get the sole custody, what would you do to take care of this child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'if you get the sole custody, how would you take care of this child?'

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在的確是們有全職的工作，但是我有兼職許多工作所以我有固定的收入，我想這些收入應該足以支撐我和女兒的生活。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '們' is added, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '有' should agree with the subject '我', but it is conjugated as '們有'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the original text mentions not having a full-time job.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned now you have several part time jobs. Because these are all part time jobs, can you estimate around how much income you will get every month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我有至少4-5件兼職工作，所以平均一個月我可以賺一萬五千元，有時候如果有接到新的計畫，可能有機會賺更多。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我可以平均一個月賺一萬五千元。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'bring me' as '可以賺' is incorrect. A more accurate translation would be '給我帶來'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about having 'on average' four to five part-time jobs.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I have another question, is it possible that when you get the sole custody of your child, you are going to bring your child back to Canada. I will as this question is because even you get the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you take your daughter back to Canada, this will be seen as you cut the tie of your daughter with the mother. To this argument, what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I will as this question is because even you get the sole custody'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text. The original text does not mention 'plea', but the user's translation includes 'what’s your plea?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the possibility of not returning to the original country.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the potential impact on the mother-daughter relationship.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了，我有居留證而且我也喜歡這裡，目前我對在台灣的生活很滿意，特別是我希望我的女兒可以看到他的父母。我要說的是目前我和我太太正在打離婚官司，我們並不希望彼此切斷與女兒的聯繫。在我們離婚官司進行中，我定期會繼我們女兒的照面給太太看，我甚至還安排時間讓我們三個有時兼聚一聚。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我要說的是目前我和我太太正在打離婚官司' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我要說的是我和我太太目前正在打離婚官司'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
so do you mean that in the recent future, you have no plan to go back to Canada, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '返回母國' as 'go back to Canada' instead of 'go back to your home country'.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不，我有可能會回加拿大因為我的母親年紀大了又生病，但即使我回去也不會長久待在那，我甚至不會考慮把女兒帶在身邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我甚至不會考慮把女兒帶在身邊' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我甚至不會考慮把女兒帶在身邊'. The verb '帶' should come before the object '女兒'.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I’m going to ask free questions to the defendant. Currently you are not living your husband any more?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, you have been separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case of divorcing?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
I guess I filed it two months ago.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'filed' should be in the past tense to match the time frame mentioned in the original text.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So you mean far before you filed the case, you hadn’t lived together already.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
What is your living circumstances right now? I mean, who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son in the first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Oh, you mean your first marriage? So what is your marriage with Ferry Johnson right now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He’s my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'husband' in a more formal sense.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
In the child rearing right that you are fighting for right now is with your second husband and it’s a daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'the child rearing right that you are fighting for right now'. The correct translation is 'child custody battle'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order. The correct translation is 'Is it your daughter with your second husband?'

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, was your daughter with you or him?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out my daughter was only two months old so she stayed with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needed the mother's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
where is the child right now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Where is the child right now?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
my daughter is at my husband’s place.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The correct word order should be 'My daughter is at my husband's place.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
do you have any agreement between you two? Why did the daughter stay with you in the first place and then move to your husband’s place?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '中間有什麼協議' as 'do you have any agreement between you two?' instead of 'what agreement do you have?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '原來女兒跟你，現在跟他' as 'Why did the daughter stay with you in the first place and then move to your husband’s place?' instead of 'Why did the daughter originally stay with you and now stay with him?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place I just moved out is smaller and my husband’s bigger. In terms of the environment, my husband’s place is better so I leave the daughter to him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'my husband’s bigger' is incorrect. It should be 'my husband’s place is bigger.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I leave the daughter to him' does not accurately convey the meaning of '我把孩子交給先生'. It should be 'I entrusted the child to my husband.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances don’t change, I mean your living situations, your daughter still better stays at your husband’s place? Why do you want to win the child rearing right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
It took me ten months to get the child. I couldn’t stand that I cannot see her any more. And my husband is a Canadian and he doesn’t have a full-time job. He may go back to Canada any time. Thus, it means I cannot see my daughter any more. That’s why I’m asking the custody of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'It took me ten months to get the child.' It should be 'I carried the child for ten months.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'It took me ten months to get the child' does not accurately convey the meaning of '她是我懷胎十個月生下來的'. The correct translation would be 'She was born after I carried her for ten months.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the speaker is the child's mother.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the speaker's husband is a Canadian citizen.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the husband's job in Taiwan is not stable.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the husband may return to Canada.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the speaker is seeking custody of the daughter.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
In terms of your financial status, can you elaborate how would you raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We still have the divorcing case going. I hope after the case of divorce I can live where my husband’s living now, the house. Thus in terms of environment, the house is better for my daughter. As to my financial status, I’ve offered the court a list of my asset. Besides, I have a regular job. I earn at least 40000 a month. I think I have the right to rear my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Thus in terms of environment, the house is better for my daughter.' The correct word order should be 'Thus, the house is better for my daughter in terms of environment.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I think I have the right to rear my daughter.' The correct verb form should be 'I think I have the right to raise my daughter.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'We still have the divorcing case going.' The correct tense should be 'We are still going through the divorce case.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence 'I hope after the case of divorce I can live where my husband’s living now, the house.' The correct sentence should include the reason for wanting to live in the house, such as 'I hope after the case of divorce I can live where my husband’s living now, in the house, because it provides a stable and familiar environment for my daughter.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence 'As to my financial status, I’ve offered the court a list of my asset.' The correct sentence should include the information about the financial status, such as 'As for my financial status, I have provided the court with a list of my assets to demonstrate my financial stability.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence 'Besides, I have a regular job. I earn at least 40000 a month.' The correct sentence should include the type of job and the stability of the income, such as 'Besides, I have a stable job with a monthly income of at least 40000.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So what’s the process going of your divorcing case? Do you know around what time the case will be settled?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the current status of the divorce case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the question about when the judgment will be made.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not quite sure. This Friday we will go to the court again. I will talk to the judge of the case that we hope to see the result faster.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I hope to express to the judge of the divorce case that I want the judgment to come out as soon as possible.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the divorce case in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Let’s say we will arrange social workers to visit both the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s houses and we will take into account the interactions of both sides with the child. The court will consider the report after the visit and make the best decision for the daughter. However, before that, will both sides consider the shared custody? The sahred custody means that the daughter will stay sometimes at the mother’s place and sometimes at father’s place.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The sahred custody means that the daughter will stay sometimes at the mother’s place and sometimes at father’s place.' is incorrect. It should be 'The shared custody means that the daughter will stay sometimes at the father’s place and sometimes at the mother’s place.'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
對我個人而言我是不希望共同撫養權，因為我的女兒還太小，他才八個月大，我不希望她在我與太太之間流轉。對於這樣年紀小的孩子來說，我覺得這樣太累，一下子搬到母親的地方、一下子換到我的地方。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '對我個人而言我是不希望共同撫養權' should be '對我個人而言，我不希望共同撫養權'.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
At this point, I agree with my husband. The daughter is too little. She shouldn’t and it’s not suitable in this case.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'shouldn’t' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'shouldn’t be'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the arrangement for co-parenting.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So we all arrange the visit of social workers first. After we see the report, we will arrange the next court day to keep the right for both parties to state their rights.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After we see the report, we will arrange the visit of social workers first.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of arranging the visit of social workers first before seeing the report.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation also omits the mention of keeping the right for both parties to state their opinions during the court day.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我同意社工人員的探訪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我同意社工人員的探訪。'

沒有問題，謝謝。
I don’t have any question here. Thank you.

Today I am here… Today this preparing procedure is for court to understand……and I also want to know why you….both of you think that you have the ability to raise the child. Please elaborate this point.Beside,I….beside I also know you have another case for divorce. So I hope there is no verbal attack in this court . Do you understand?

yes,i do

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, let me ask some questions.So plaintiff , why do you want to get the custody right?as i know, you don’t have a job in taiwan. and you are also a foreigner. So for the child rearing case, why do you think you have ability to raise your child?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'let me ask some questions' from the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'do you want' instead of 'why do you want' in the question.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭取' as 'get' instead of 'fight for' in the question.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '撫養權' as 'custody right' instead of 'custody' in the question.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'as i know' from the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'you don’t have a job in taiwan' from the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'and you are also a foreigner' from the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'do you think' instead of 'why do you think' in the question.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '適任' as 'ability' instead of 'suitable' in the question.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '子女撫養權' as 'child rearing case' instead of 'child custody' in the question.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望可以把所有撫養權都判給我，因為我很關心他。第一我老婆已經不再跟我們一起住了，我想要看著我的女兒長大，而且我還聽說我的老婆跟別的男人同居，如果真的是這樣的話我懷疑我老婆沒有能力養活這孩子，所以我要爭取全部的撫養權。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

grammar and structure	pronoun errors	incorrect pronoun usage

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
what you mean is because your wife have divorce case with you, so she is not live with you,right? and you doubt that she lives with other man. it is because of this situation, you don’t want to give your children to her.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，這就是我所關心的。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Other than that, for your financial statement,how do you raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在的確沒有全職的工作。但是我有幾份打工，應該可以提供我所有需要。我想這些收入足以養我和我的女兒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在的確沒有全職的工作。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '應該可以提供我所有需要' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.'

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. since all of them are part-time job, can you estimate your regular income per month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Can you estimate your regular income per month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我個人大概有四到五個兼職工作。全部加起來的話，一個月大概可以提供五萬塊的收入。有時候如果我有接到新案子的話，每個月的收入都會更加增加。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'part-time jobs' in the translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bring me' as '提供' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'bring' in this context.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '的話' which is not present in the original text and is unnecessary.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
So other than salary, will you bring your daughter to Canada after you got the custody, and you will never come back? I mention this point is that even if you got the sole custody, your wife still have visitation right. If you take your daughter back to Canada, it means that you cut the tie with your daughter and her mother. So what do you think?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了。我已經有居留證，而且我很喜歡這個地方。目前還沒有任何打算離開台灣的計畫。而且我也覺得我的女兒也希望可以見到父母。我想說的是即使我現在在和我老婆打離婚官司，我也沒有打算切斷她和女兒之間的聯繫。在我們打離婚官司的同時，我也常常寄我們女兒的照片給她。我甚至和她達成協議，有時候可以大家一起出來聚聚。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我已經有居留證' should be '我已經有居留證了'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean that you are not going back to Canada recently, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '返回母國' as 'going back to Canada', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
沒有...如果我要回加拿大的話是因為我媽媽又老又生病了。然而，就算我回去加拿大了，我也不會在那裡久留。我也不會考慮把我的女兒帶回去加拿大。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '沒有...如果我要回加拿大的話是因為我媽媽又老又生病了'

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
And now i am going to ask your wife some question.You are not live with your husband now, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Are you not living with your husband now?'

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes,we have already separate for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'separate' should be in the past tense to agree with the subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
So when do you seek for divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So you mean that far before…you ….seek divorce, you have already separate for some time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
Can you tell me your living standard….i mean…who lives with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my second son…
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '第一任婚姻的兒子' as 'second son' instead of 'first son'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? so ……..
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the question about the number of marriages.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the child rearing case we dicuss here is your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'child rearing case' instead of 'child custody case'.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is about eight month.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the plural subject 'years'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
After you leave your house, your daughter stay with you or hisband.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'stay' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'stays' instead of 'stay'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When i leave my husband, since my daughter is still small, so the daughter….
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'When I leave my husband, my daughter is still small.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the daughter needed the mother's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So where is the child?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'now' in the translation.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
 Is there any agreement with you and your hisband?first, your daughter live with you, and now she live with your husband, why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '協議' as 'agreement' instead of 'husband'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '原來' which means 'originally'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '女兒' which means 'daughter'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '現在' which means 'now'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '他' which means 'him'.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I move out, the  place where we were live is a little bit smaller than my husband’s house. So I think the environment is better for the children, so I give my daughter to my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'the place where we were live' is incorrect. It should be 'the place where we lived'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'give my daughter to my husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '把孩子交給先生'. It should be 'give custody of my daughter to my husband'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So if objective condition is not change, you still don’t have….better…so why do you want to get custody of your daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter, I cannot bear not to see her in the future. Beside, my husband is canadian, and he don’t have a regular job, and he may lost her job and go back to Canada. in that case, I will never see my daughter.That’ why I want the custody of my daughter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '懷胎十個月' as 'daughter' instead of 'pregnant for ten months'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'don't' instead of 'doesn't' to agree with the singular subject 'husband'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the mother being pregnant for ten months.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the husband's job not being stable and the possibility of him going back to Canada.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the mother wanting to fight for custody of her daughter.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Can you elaborate how do you raise your daughter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'financially' which is important in the context of discussing how to afford the daughter's expenses.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'raise' before the subject 'you', which is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'How do you raise your daughter?'

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Since we are still in divorce case. as for the environment, it’s fit for my daughter. as for my finical statement, I have already provide the asset list for the courts other than that I have a regular job, it’s about forty thousand a month.So I think I have ability to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'as for the environment, it’s fit for my daughter.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'as for my finical statement, I have already provide the asset list for the courts.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'I have a regular job, it’s about forty thousand a month.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after the introductory phrase 'as for the environment'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the specific details about the house that make it suitable for the daughter's growth.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the specific details about the financial statement and the asset list provided to the court.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the specific details about the job and the monthly income.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
May I ask about your divorce case?Do you know when will the result revil?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the current status of the divorce case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the expected judgment date.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. We have another court this week. I want to ask the judge, for the divorce case, I hope the verdict will come out soon.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I hope the verdict for the divorce case will come out soon.'

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok now we will arrange social workers for the both side. And the evaluation will be about how you take care of your daughter. We will refer the the report and decide what is better for your daughter. and before that,will you both side consider share the custody?As for the share custody, it’s mean that the daughter live with after and mother for sometime.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And the evaluation will be about how you take care of your daughter.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the social workers visiting both parties in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court considering the social workers' report in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court making arrangements for the child based on the evaluation and report in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'will you both side consider share the custody?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '共同撫養' as 'share the custody' instead of 'joint custody'.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人來說，我不太喜歡這個提議，因為我的女兒還太小，他也只有八個月大而已。我不想要讓他經歷我跟我老婆這段破碎的關係。對於年紀這麼小的女兒來說，他應該會覺得突然跟爸爸或是媽媽住是一件很奇怪的事情。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree my husband at this point. my daughter is too small, she is not okay for this kind of resolution.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'daughter'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '共同撫養的安排方式' as 'this kind of resolution', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '共同撫養' (co-parenting).

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay, so we arrange the social worker for evaluation first.After they finish report,we will arrange the court for another day to let both party has chance to elaborate their right.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After they finish the report, we will arrange the court for another day to let both parties have a chance to elaborate their rights.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'the' before 'social worker evaluation'. The correct translation should be 'arrange the social worker for evaluation first.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'the' before 'court'. The correct translation should be 'arrange the court for another day.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'their' before 'rights'. The correct translation should be 'let both parties have a chance to elaborate their rights.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我沒有問題
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of social workers' visits.

沒有問題，謝謝。
i am fine, too.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
In the preparatory procedure today, we want to know your opinions about child rearing. And I also want to know why both of you think you are more suitable for the child. Please elaborate this detail.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Now I am going to ask the plaintiff some questions. Plaintiff, why do you fight for the custody of your child? As I know, you don’t have a full time job now, in Taiwan. And also you are a foreigner. Why do you think you are suitable for your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think you are suitable for your child?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks why the plaintiff believes they are suitable for custody, while the user's translation asks why the plaintiff thinks they are suitable for their child.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望可以把小孩全權判給我有兩個原因 首先我老婆已經不跟我們住在一起了 我想要看著我的小孩長大 而且我聽說我老婆現在跟別的男人住在一起 如果真的是這樣的話 我很懷疑他能不能好好的養育我的小孩 因此我希望有全部的撫養權
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean you and your wife is going a divorcing case, but she no longer lives with you? And you think she lives with another man? Is that the reason why you don’t want her to take care of the child, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對阿 這是我主要的考量

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
As for your financial status, I mean if you get the custody, what would you do?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在是真的沒有一份全職的工作啦 可是我有很幾份兼職的工作讓我也有正常的收入  我相信我的收入足夠來養我跟我的小孩
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have many part time jobs. They are all part time jobs, so can you make sure how much money can you make per month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Can you make sure how much money you can make per month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有四到五份兼職工作 平均來說 我一個月有五萬塊 有時候如果有新case的話可能還會賺更多錢
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	case should be translated as project

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
And I also want to know if you get the custody of your child, will you go back to Canada and no longer come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask this question is that even you get the custody; your wife still had the visitation right. If you take your child back to your country, it means that you cut the tie between them. What’s your opinion about this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '隔離' as 'cut the tie' instead of 'separate'.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣住五年了 我有居留證而且我也喜歡這個地方 目前我沒有離開台灣的計畫 而且我認為我女兒有見到父母雙方的權利 我想強調的是 雖然我跟我太太正在辦離婚 可是我完全沒有要切斷他跟我女兒的關係 在打離婚官司的過程中 我也都會固定傳女兒照片給我老婆 我還安排出去的機會讓她跟女兒有相處的時間
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我已經在台灣住五年了' should be '我已經在台灣住了五年了'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean you don’t have the plain to go back to your country in a short time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
沒有我可能會回加拿大 因為我媽已經老了而且在生病 可是就算我回去也不會待很久 我甚至不會考慮要帶著女兒一起回去
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "沒有我可能會回加拿大" is incorrect. It should be "我可能會回加拿大".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb "回去" should be future tense, but it is translated as present tense "回去".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the phrase "because my mother is old and sick" which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the phrase "I won't even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me" which is an important detail in the original text.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay now I want to ask you some question. So you don’t live with your husband now, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'you don't live' instead of 'you don't lives'.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have lived apart for 6 months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'lived' should be in the past tense to agree with the subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case of divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you file the case of divorce?'

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'submitted' in their translation.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That is, long before you sued for divorce, you don’t lived together.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So who do you live with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son from my first marriage.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about living together with the son from the first marriage.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? so you and the plaintiff’s marriage is…?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'husband' is not an accurate translation for '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the custody we are saying now, is your second child, your daughter, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly refers to the custody as the second child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user uses 'is' instead of 'are' to match the plural subject 'we'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omits the mention of 'you' as the second person in the conversation.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
So how old are your son and daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My sun is seven years old now, and my daughter is 8 months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'sun' should be 'son' to match the subject 'my'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be 'was' to indicate past tense.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, your daughter lived with you or him?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out, our daughter was only two months old. She still needed lot of cares, so she lived with me.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'She lived with me' instead of 'She lived with me.'

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Then, presently, who does she live with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now she lives with my husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation changes the meaning of the original text. 'Now she lives with my husband' implies that the daughter is currently living with the husband, while the original text states that the daughter is currently with the husband.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter originally lived you, but now with him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '中間有什麼協議' as 'Is there any agreement between you and your husband?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation 'Why your daughter originally lived you, but now with him?' has incorrect word order.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place I live now is smaller, and the original house I lived with my husband is bigger. Considering about the environment, I think the old house is better for my daughter, so I took her back to live with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Considering about the environment' is incorrect. It should be 'Considering the environment'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I took her back to live with my husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '我把孩子交給先生'. It should be translated as 'I entrusted my child to my husband'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So considering about the objective circumstance, I mean the space of your house, it’s still worse for her, isn’t it? Then why would you want the custody of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
Come on, I borne her! How would you think I don’t want to see her in the future? Also my husband is a Canadian, and his job is Taiwan is not stable so he may go back to Canada anytime. In that case, doesn’t that mean I can see my daughter anymore? So I want to have the custody of my daughter.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form 'borne' instead of 'born'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'How would you think' instead of 'How could you think'
grammar and structure	tense errors	inconsistent use of present tense ('don't want') and future tense ('will go')
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '懷胎十個月' as 'borne her' instead of 'born her'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '生下來的' in 'I borne her'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '阿' in 'I borne her'

semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '她' in 'I borne her'

semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '而且' in 'Also my husband is a Canadian'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定' in 'his job is Taiwan is not stable'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '隨時有可能會回去加拿大' in 'he may go back to Canada anytime'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '那這樣子的話' in 'In that case'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '我不就見不到女兒了嗎' in 'doesn’t that mean I can see my daughter anymore'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權' in 'So I want to have the custody of my daughter'

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Can you tell me how would bring up your child? With your financial status.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far, we are still dealing with the divorcing case. I want to fight for the right to live in the house which my husband lives now, after our divorce. So consider about the environmental issue, the house will suit my daughter a lot. As for my financial status, I have given the court an asset list. Also, I have a regular income; it’s about 40000 per month. So I think I have the ability to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'So far, we are still dealing with the divorcing case' is incorrect. It should be 'We are still dealing with the divorcing case so far.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'fight for the right to live in the house' is a mismatched meaning. It should be 'fight for the right to live in the house after our divorce.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'So consider about the environmental issue' is incorrect. It should be 'Consider the environmental issue.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the house will suit my daughter a lot' is a mismatched meaning. It should be 'the house will be suitable for my daughter's growth.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'As for my financial status, I have given the court an asset list' is incorrect. It should be 'I have given the court an asset list for my financial status.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Also, I have a regular income; it’s about 40000 per month' is incorrect. It should be 'I also have a regular income, which is about 40000 per month.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'So I think I have the ability to take care of my daughter' is a mismatched meaning. It should be 'So I believe I am capable of raising and taking care of my daughter.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So how your divorcing case is goes now? Do you know when will the court’s decision come out?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'divorcing' instead of 'divorce' which is an incorrect word choice.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorcing case going now?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the information about the court's decision in their translation.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not very sure about that. We will go to the court this Friday. I will ask the judge of our divorcing case to make the decision as soon.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, then I will sent the social to do to visit both of your houses. And make an evaluation of how you get along with your daughter. And I will take their report into consideration to decide what’s best for the child. Before that, I want to ask both of you, would you consider about sharing shared custody of your daughter? The shared custody goes like that, your daughter will live with you sometime, and the other time lives with your husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Okay, then I will sent the social to do to visit both of your houses.' The correct word order should be: 'Okay, then I will send the social worker to visit both of your houses.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'And make an evaluation of how you get along with your daughter.' The correct form should be: 'And make an evaluation of how you get along with your daughter.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'And I will take their report into consideration to decide what’s best for the child.' The correct form should be: 'And I will take their report into consideration to decide what is best for the child.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence: 'Before that, I want to ask both of you, would you consider about sharing shared custody of your daughter?' The correct form should be: 'Before that, I want to ask both of you, would you consider sharing custody of your daughter?'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不支持這個 因為我女兒還在小了 他只有八個月大耶 我不想要她一直在我跟我老婆之間一直改變環境 對一個這麼小的小孩來說 他會混淆吧 如果他真得要這樣跟我住一段時間又跟她住一段時間
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out critical context

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree with my husband in this. She is too small, it shouldn’t to this way.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'it shouldn’t to this way.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'also not suitable' in the translation.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay, then, I will arrange the social worker to your houses first. After the make the report, we will set the court date to let both of you have a chance to make a statement, is that okay with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'After the make the report' should be 'After they make the report'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'social worker' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好啊 社工要來我可以
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I am fine with that, too.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today we are here for the preparation procedure of custody case for Ferry Johnson and Tsai-yun Shih. Do both parties have the lawyer?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有請律師
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
In today’s procedure, I want to know what the idea of both parties in custody is. I also want know why both of you think that you are suitable for getting the custody. Please focus on it as your statement. Besides, you are also having the divorce case. So I want both of you would not have verbal attack to each other.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'what the idea of both parties in custody is' is incorrect. It should be 'what the idea of both parties is in custody'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'getting' should agree with the subject 'both of you', so it should be 'both of you think that you are suitable for getting custody'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'are having' should be in the present continuous tense to match the context, so it should be 'you are also having the divorce case'.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
At first I will ask some questions to plaintiff. Why you want to get the custody of your child? As I know, you don’t have the full-time job in Taipei. Also, you are a foreigner. In the case of custody, why you strive for rearing your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of asking questions to the plaintiff.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of asking why the plaintiff believes they are more suitable.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the mention of the plaintiff being a foreigner.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我之所以希望能得到全部的撫養權有兩個原因。首先，我老婆不再與我們住在一起了，我希望能看著我小孩長大。再來，我聽說我老婆現在跟別的男人住在一起，如果真的是那樣的話，我很懷疑我女兒能得到全然的照顧。因此我希望擁有全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence structure.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean you are no longer live together though you are under the case of divorce? Also, you doubt that she is living together with another man. I that circumstances, you don’t want to share the custody with your wife?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這是我主要考慮的一些因素。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural context of the original text.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Otherwise, concerning your financial status, if you get the custody of your daughter, how would you raise your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'how would you raise your child?' instead of 'how would you child raise?'

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
雖然我現在沒有正職工作是真的，但是我有好幾份兼職工作讓我有固定的收入。我相信這足夠讓我和我女兒過活。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb phrase '是真的' should come after the subject '我'.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Can you promise that you have regular income?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均會有四到五個兼職，總共來說我大概會有五萬的收入。有時如果有另外的案子我可以有更多的收入。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I have a further question, is that possible to bring your child to Canada and no more back to Taiwan after you get the custody? The reason why I ask so because even you get sole custody, your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring your child back to Canada, you are separating your wife and child. What’s your idea to this point?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of custody and visitation rights in their translation.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年，我有居留證，而且我也愛這個地方。目前我沒有要離開台灣。另外我也覺得我的女兒有權利可以看到她的爸爸媽媽。雖然我和我老婆正在打離婚官司，我絕對沒有意圖想阻止我女兒與老婆之間的聯繫。在我跟我老婆打離婚官司的過程中，我仍會定期傳女兒的照片給她。我也有鼓勵她多與我們相處。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我絕對沒有意圖想阻止我女兒與老婆之間的聯繫' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我絕對沒有意圖想阻止我女兒與老婆之間的聯繫'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So recently you don’t plan to back to Canada?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'So, you don't plan to go back to Canada recently?'

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
我有可能會回去加拿大因為我媽媽年老且生病。但就算我回去我也不會待很久。我甚至不會想帶我女兒一起回加拿大。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我有可能會回去加拿大' is incorrect. It should be '我有可能會回去加拿大'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb '回去' should be future tense, so it should be '我有可能會回去加拿大'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the mother being old and sick in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not considering the possibility of taking the daughter with them in the translation.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay I have some question to ask the opposite position. Aren’t you living with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
No, we haven’t lived together for six months.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce suit?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
It might be two months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is 'I'.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So you didn’t live together before you file the lawsuit, right?.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So what’s your living situation, I mean, who do you live together with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son of my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
The first marriage? What time is the marriage with plaintiff?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '告訴人' as 'plaintiff' instead of 'the person who told you'

他是我第二任先生。
He is the second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'husband' in a more formal sense.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
null

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? And how old is your daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out the house, who was your daughter with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because my daughter was only two months old when I was moving out. She needed my care so she was with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they moved out.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'she was' instead of 'she is' to describe the current situation.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Where is daughter with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
My daughter is with my husband now.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter was first with you and now she is with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你們中間有什麼協議嗎' as 'Is there any agreement between you and your husband?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation 'Why your daughter was first with you and now she is with your husband?' has incorrect word order.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place where I am living is smaller than the house when I lived with my husband. I think, environmentally, it is good for my daughter to live with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The place where I am living is smaller than the house I lived in with my husband.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I think' is not present in the original text and changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the reason for giving the child to the husband, which is '環境上來說，對孩子比較優' (environmentally, it is good for my daughter).

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So in the objective circumstances, if it isn’t changed, it isn’t good for your daughter to live with you. Why you still want the custody of your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I had ten months pregnant to give birth to her. She is my child. And my husband is a Canadian, also he doesn’t have the full-time job, he might go back to Canada any time. If so, I would not see my daughter any more. So I want to be granted with the custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of gestation period

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
To your financial status, can you clarify how you raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are under the case of divorce. I hope that I can get the right to live in the house which my husband is living in after divorcing. That house is good for my daughter to grow. Also I provide a asset list to the court to make clear my financial status. In addition, I have full-time job and my wage a month is up to forty thousands. I think I capable to take care and raise my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'That house is good for my daughter to grow.' It should be 'That house is good for my daughter to grow in.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'I have full-time job and my wage a month is up to forty thousands.' It should be 'I have a full-time job and my wage a month is up to forty thousand.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'I think I capable to take care and raise my daughter.' It should be 'I think I am capable of taking care and raising my daughter.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How’s going with your divorce case? Do you know when is the court’s decision? Or the maybe-date?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case going?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the current status of the divorce case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the question about the expected date of the court's decision.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the request for a general idea of when the court's decision will be made.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. We will have the court date this Friday. I want to inform the judge of the divorce case…………
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, I will arrange the social worker to visit both of you. And make evaluations separately between both of you and your daughter. It will be the reference to the court decision of the custody. Before that, will you want to share the custody? To the definition of shared custody, it means, in a period of time, the child is with father, then, in another period of time, the child is with mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'It will be the reference to the court decision of the custody' is incorrect. It should be 'It will be the reference for the court decision of the custody.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence 'And make evaluations separately between both of you and your daughter.' It should be 'And make evaluations separately between both of you and your daughter.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'share' is used instead of 'hold' in the sentence 'Before that, will you want to share the custody?' It should be 'Before that, will you want to hold the custody?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'in a period of time' is used instead of 'for a period of time' in the sentence 'To the definition of shared custody, it means, in a period of time, the child is with father, then, in another period of time, the child is with mother.' It should be 'To the definition of shared custody, it means, for a period of time, the child is with father, then, for another period of time, the child is with mother.'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
個人來說，我沒有很喜歡這個主意，我女兒還太小。她才八個月大，我不想要她年紀那麼小就經歷那麼多變動。對這麼小的小孩而言，一下跟爸爸住一下跟媽媽住可能會讓她覺得困惑。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'favor' as '喜歡' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'favor' in this context. It should be translated as '支持' or '贊同'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'arrangement', so it should be translated as '這個安排是' instead of '這個主意是'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the changes between the parents and only mentions staying with one parent at a time.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
In that point, I agree with my husband. It’s too young to my daughter.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay I get it. I will arrange the visit of social worker. After the evaluation, we will arrange another court date to make opportunities that both parties can state. Is that okay with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I will arrange the visit of a social worker.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of waiting for the social worker's report before arranging another court date.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of giving both parties an opportunity to express their opinions during the court date.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好的我對社工人員的探訪沒有意見。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
It’s fine with me, thank you.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today’s purpose is to realize the position of you two about child rearing. And I hope that I can know that why do you to all think that yourself are suitable to raise this child. please elaborate this point in detail. In addition, I know that you are also in the divorce procedure, so I hope that both of you do not have any verbal attack to  each other in today’s court, it that ok with both of you?

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Please tell me that why you want to fight for the custody? I know that you don’t have a full time job in Taiwan, and you are also a foreigner. As for fighting for child rearing , why do you think that you are suitable for ?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think that you are suitable for fighting for child rearing?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '爭取子女撫養權' as 'fighting for child rearing' is incorrect. It should be translated as 'fighting for custody'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail that the person is asking why the speaker thinks they are suitable for fighting for custody, given their lack of a full-time job and being a foreigner.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望我能獲得我女兒全部的撫養權。首先,我老婆早就不跟我們一起住了。我想陪著我女兒長大。再者，我早就聽聞我老婆已經跟另外一個男生住在一起了。如果這是真的，我非常懷疑我老婆是不是能給我女兒一個最完善的照顧。因此，我希望我可以獲得全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我希望我能獲得我女兒全部的撫養權' (I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter). The correct word order should be '我希望能獲得我女兒全部的撫養權' (I hope to be granted the sole custody of my daughter).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我希望我能獲得我女兒全部的撫養權' (I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter) is translated as 'I hope I can get all the custody of my daughter' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'sole custody'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase '因此，我希望我可以獲得全部的撫養權' (Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody) is translated as 'Therefore, I hope I can get all the custody' which omits the word 'sole' and does not accurately convey the intended meaning.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that although you are in divorce procedure, your wife hasn’t lived with you. Moreover, you also suspect that your wife has already lived with another guy? In this situation, you don’t want to let your wife take care of your child, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的,這些是我的疑慮
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
besides, as for your personal financial status, how do you take your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
的確，我現在是沒有全職工作。但是我有很多份兼職工作可以有穩定的收入。我相信這些收入夠我可以照顧我自己以及我女兒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
Yu just mentioned that you have several part time jobs so far。Because they are all part time jobs, can you estimate that how much fixed income do you earn each month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'You just mentioned' instead of 'Yu just mentioned'.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有四到五份兼職工作。總共大概每個月可賺五萬塊。有時候，如果我有接到新的案件，就可以賺到更多錢。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I want to ask you another question, which is that will you bring your daughter back to Canada and never come back after you are granted with sole custody. The reason why I ask you this question is that even if you are granted with sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your kid back to Canada, which means that you separate your daughter and wife. What’s your opinion about this?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's opinion or perspective on the matter.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待五年了。我有居留證號碼，而且我也喜歡這個地方。目前我沒有打算離開台灣。特別是我覺得我女兒應該要有權利可以看到她麼爸媽。我意思是，雖然我跟我老婆正在打離婚官司，我也沒有意思要打斷他們兩個之間的聯繫。甚至在官司期間，我固定會寄女兒的照片給我老婆。我甚至都會安排外出活動，鼓勵他多花時間跟我跟我女兒在一起。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我覺得我女兒應該要有權利可以看到她麼爸媽' is incorrect. It should be '我覺得我女兒應該要有權利可以看到她的爸媽'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '打斷' should agree with the subject '我', so it should be '我沒有意思要打斷'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '待' should be in the past tense to match the time frame mentioned in the original text. It should be '我已經在台灣待了五年了。'
grammar and structure	agreement errors in number or gender	The pronoun '她麼爸媽' should be '她的爸媽' to agree in gender and number with the possessive pronoun '她'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user having an ARC (Alien Resident Certificate) in Taiwan, which is an important detail mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user regularly sending their daughter's pictures to their wife during the divorce case, which is an important detail mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user arranging outings to encourage the wife to spend time with them and their daughter, which is an important detail mentioned in the original text.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
you mean that you don’t have intention of going back to your hometown recently, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
對。我可能會回去是因為我媽媽老了也生病了。即使我回家加拿大，我也不會待很久。我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒一起去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我回家加拿大" is incorrect. It should be "我回加拿大家".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb "回去" should be consistent with the tense of the verb "回家加拿大". It should be "我可能會回去" instead of "我可能會回去".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker's mother is sick.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
now I am going to ask the other party that do you live with your husband now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
yes, we have been separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the plural subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
when do you …….
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
about two months ago
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'submitted' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
that is to say, you have been separated before you sue for divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
what’s your ………., I mean, who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son …………
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the user's first marriage.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? What the …….
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used an inappropriate word ('…….') instead of providing a proper translation for the omitted text.

他是我第二任先生。
he is my second husband
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'husband' depending on the context.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
so whom you are fighting for child rearing is …………………..
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對。
yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
how old is your son? And how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
my son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight month old
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the plural subject 'months'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
so when you move out, whom does your daughter lives with ,you or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'lives' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'does your daughter live' instead of 'does your daughter lives'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
when I move out, my daughter is only two month old, she still needs me, so she lived with me.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'lived' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'lives' instead of 'lived'.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
where is your daughter now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '那現在孩子在誰那裏？' as 'where is your daughter now?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks 'Who is the child with now?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
she lives with my husband now.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you have any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter lived with you before and now she lives with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '中間有什麼協議' as 'Do you have any agreement between you and your husband?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation 'Why your daughter lived with you before and now she lives with your husband?' has incorrect word order. It should be 'Why did your daughter live with you before and now she lives with your husband?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
where I move in is smaller than that which my husband lived. As far as environment is concerned, it’s better for child, so I let my daughter live with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'where I moved in' instead of 'where I move in'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '比較優' as 'better for child' is incorrect. It should be 'better for the child'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker is referring to their daughter. It should be 'so I let my daughter live with my husband'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
if there is ………., your environment condition is not good for your daughter, right? Why do you still want to fight for child rearing?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the specific condition that would make the environment not good for the daughter.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
………, how can I bear that I cannot see her anymore? My husband is Canadian, he doesn’t have steady job in Taiwan, he may go back to Canada anytime. In that way, I will no longer see my daughter. So , I hope I can fight for child rearing.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
as for your financial status, can you further elaborate that how do you afford your daughter’s arising expenditure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Can you further elaborate on how you afford your daughter's arising expenditure?'

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
we are still in divorce procedure, so I hope that I can live in the house where my husband is living in. as for the environment, that would be suitable for my daughter. As for my personal financial status, I have provided the court with an asset list. Besides that, I have a regular income which is at least 40000 dollars. I think that I am able to raise my daughter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the ongoing divorce procedure, which is an important detail in the original text.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
……… when does your sentence will make. That is to say,……
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. We will attend the court on Friday. I hope that I can express my opinion of making the sentence done.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
alright, the court will arrange social worker to pay a visit to both of you and make a evaluation focus on how do you get along with your daughter. The court will decide which arrangement is better for child depends on their reports. Before that, I would like to ask you that will both of you consider keeping shared custody which means your child will live with father for some time and live with mother for another time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Before that, I would like to ask you that will both of you consider keeping shared custody' is incorrect. It should be 'Before that, I would like to ask both of you if you would consider keeping shared custody.'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人是不喜歡這樣的安排，因為我女兒還太小。他只有8個月大。我不想要他跟著我們的決定兩地奔波。對於一個這麼小的小孩，這些對他來說實在是太困惑了，一下要跟媽媽住，一下又要跟爸爸住。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form '他' should be '她'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of 'changes between me and my wife' as '跟著我們的決定兩地奔波'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time'

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
as for this, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small; she should not, and is not suitable for this kind of arrangement of shared custody
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I agree with my husband on this point.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the information about the daughter being too young for shared custody.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The translation adds the phrase 'and is not suitable for this kind of arrangement of shared custody', which is not present in the original text.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
since that, we will arrange social worker to visit you first. After they finishing their reports, we will arrange the court date and …….
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about giving both parties an opportunity to express their opinions.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我也同意社工探訪.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today, we are here for the preparation procedure of Mr. Johnson and Miss. Shih, their child rearing case. Do both parties have lawyers?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我有委託律師。
Yes, I have my lawyer.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有請律師。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today, the judge mainly wants to know the idea of both parties on the child rearing case. I also want to know the reasons why do you think you are suitable to raise the children. Please answer the question to me. Also, I know you are dealing with the divorce case. Therefore, I don’t want to see any situation of verbal attack, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Please answer the question to me' is incorrect. It should be 'Please answer the question for me.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'do' in the sentence 'Therefore, I don’t want to see any situation of verbal attack, do you understand?' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'do I understand?'

I understand.
我了解

了解。
I understand.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I want to ask few questions for the plaintiff. Why do you want to get the rearing right of your children. In my understandings, you don’t have the full-time job in Taiwan. And you are a foreigner. Why do you think that you are more suitable for raising your children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think that you are more suitable for raising your children?'

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望我可以得到我子女全部的扶養權，就以下這幾點。首先，我妻子已經沒有再跟我們住在一起了，我希望我可以陪伴著我孩子成長。此外，我還知道我太太跟其他男人住在一起，如果真是如此，我很懷疑她是否真能給我們的孩子最好的照顧。因此，我希望可以得到全部的扶養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我希望我可以得到我子女全部的扶養權' should be '我希望可以得到我子女全部的扶養權'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that your wife is no longer live with you even if she is still under the divorcing case? Moreover, you doubt that she is living with another man now? It is because under such circumstance that you do not want her to take care of your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，這是我主要這樣做的原因。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Regarding with your financial status, if you get the right to raise your daughter, how do you deal with your financial status? How do you have the money to take care of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有所謂正職的工作是事實啦，但是我現在也有一些打工啊，都可以帶給我固定的收入。我相信那些收入已經足夠讓我和我的女兒生活了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The adverbial phrase '是事實啦' should come after the subject '我'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '打工啊' is not an accurate translation for 'part-time jobs'. It should be translated as '兼職工作' or '臨時工作'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of having 'several' part-time jobs, which is an important detail in the original text.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because they are part-time jobs, can you calculate how much money that you are sure you can earn per month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'can you estimate how much money you are sure you can earn per month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我有四到五個打工的工作，平均來說。這大概可以讓我每個月賺五萬元左右吧。如果我有得到新的工作的話，也許這收入會更高。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Moreover, I want to know that if you have the right to raise children; will you take your child back to Canada and you will not come back ever again? I would ask this question is because even if you do get the right to raise your children, your wife may still have the visitation right for your child. If you take your child back to Canada, it will transform into the separation of the mother and the child. What your opinion about this?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the wife having visitation rights.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '隔離她們母女見面' as 'separation of the mother and the child', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣住五年了。我不只有居留證我也很喜歡這裡。到目前為止，我沒有想要離開台灣的打算。而且我也認同我女兒必須要見到父母雙方。而且我也想要重申，即使我和我太太目前還在打離婚官司，我卻沒有想阻止她們母女倆互相見面的權利。就在我們還在打離婚官司時，我不時會寄我女兒的照片給太太，我還邀請我太太一起和我和女兒出去玩。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我不只有居留證我也很喜歡這裡' should be '我不只很喜歡這裡，我還有居留證'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '而且我也認同我女兒必須要見到父母雙方' should be '而且我也認同我女兒必須要見到雙方父母'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '而且我也想要重申，即使我和我太太目前還在打離婚官司，我卻沒有想阻止她們母女倆互相見面的權利' should be '而且我也想要重申，即使我和我太太目前還在打離婚官司，我卻沒有想阻止她們母女倆互相見面的權利'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '就在我們還在打離婚官司時，我不時會寄我女兒的照片給太太，我還邀請我太太一起和我和女兒出去玩' should be '就在我們還在打離婚官司時，我不時會寄我女兒的照片給太太，我還邀請我太太和我一起和女兒出去玩'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
Do you mean that you do not have the plan to go back to Canada recently?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
我也許會回加拿大，但那是因為我媽媽已經年紀很大而且又生病了。但是即使我回去了，我也不會長久待在那裡，我會讓我女兒一直和我待在一起。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the part where the speaker states that they wouldn't consider taking their daughter with them.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我女兒一直和我待在一起' in the wrong position in the sentence.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Next, I want to ask few questions to the wife. Are you currently not living with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have already separately lived for about half a year.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorcing case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'submitted' in their translation.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
so before you file the divorcing case, both of you did not live together anymore?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not living together before filing for divorce.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
What your living condition right now? I mean who did you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son from the first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So ,which marriage is you with your current husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So, the case of rearing we are fighting now is for the daughter of your second marriage.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'the case of rearing we are fighting now'. The correct translation is 'the custody battle we are currently fighting'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order is 'the custody battle for the daughter of your second marriage'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker's gender in the translation. The correct translation should include 'your daughter' instead of just 'the daughter'.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, was your daughter with you or with your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'is your daughter with you or with him?'

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Since when I moved out, my daughter is just two months old, so she was with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needs the mother's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Where is your daughter now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '那現在孩子在誰那裏？' as 'Where is your daughter now?' which is a mismatched meaning. The correct translation should be 'Who is the child with now?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
My daughter is with my husband now.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between both parties? Why the daughter was with you first but the daughter was with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '中間有什麼協議' as 'Is there any agreement between both parties?' instead of 'What agreement do you have?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'Why was the daughter with you first, but now with your husband?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place I live after I moved out is smaller than the place my husband have. After consideration of the environment, I think the bigger house is more suitable for my daughter so I let my husband to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'the place my husband have' should be 'the place my husband has'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I let my husband to take care of my daughter' should be 'I entrusted my daughter to my husband'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstance does not change, I mean that you sill live in the smaller house, I don’t think it will be good for your child. Why do you want to fight for the rearing right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is “my” daughter, I can’t imagine if I cannot see her anymore. Besides, my husband is a foreigner from Canada. He might go back to Canada because he even does not have a full-time job in Taiwan. In that case, I might not see my daughter ever again. As a result, I want to fight for the rearing right of my daughter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '懷胎十個月' as 'imagine if' instead of 'born after ten months of pregnancy'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '生下來的' which means 'born' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '我希望能夠' which means 'I hope to' in the translation.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
From your financial status, can you explain how do you plan to cover the money to take care of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we are still on the divorce case. Now, I hope to get the court decision that my daughter and I can live in the house which my husband currently live. According to the environment, I think that house will be very suitable for the growth of my daughter. About my personal financial status, I have already given the court my asset lists. Moreover, I have the full-time job and the salary is about forty thousand NT dollars a month. I think I am able to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Now, we are still on the divorce case.' It should be 'We are still on the divorce case now.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'get the court decision' should be 'obtain a court decision' to accurately convey the meaning.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'live in the house which my husband currently live' should be 'live in the house where my husband currently lives' to indicate the correct verb tense and subject-verb agreement.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'According to the environment, I think that house will be very suitable for the growth of my daughter.' It should be 'I think that house will be very suitable for the growth of my daughter, according to the environment.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I have already given the court my asset lists' should be 'I have already provided the court with my asset lists' to accurately convey the meaning.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The phrase 'the salary is about forty thousand NT dollars a month' should be 'the salary is about forty thousand NT dollars per month' to indicate the correct preposition and clarify the frequency of the salary.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I think I am able to take care of my daughter' should be 'I believe I am capable of taking care of my daughter' to accurately convey the meaning.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
Can you tell me what stage are your divorce case in? Do you know when or around what time the court decision will be given?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What stage is your divorce case in?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the court decision in the original text.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. We will be here for the divorce case this Friday. I hope I may ask the judge of my divorce case to give the court decision as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'may' is not appropriate in this context.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific day for the court appearance.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
The court will hire the social workers to visit the houses of both parties. Also, according to the ways you dealing with your children, the social worker will evaluate it. The report will be examined by the court and we will make a decision on it. But before that, I want to ask both parties if you ever consider the shared custody? Shared custody is defined as follows, the child will firstly with the father and then he or she will latter with mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Also, according to the ways you dealing with your children, the social worker will evaluate it.' It should be 'Also, the social worker will evaluate the ways you are dealing with your children.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'The report will be examined by the court and we will make a decision on it.' It should be 'The report will be examined by the court and the court will make a decision on it.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence 'But before that, I want to ask both parties if you ever consider the shared custody?' It should be 'But before that, I want to ask both parties if you have ever considered shared custody?'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
就個人來講，我不太喜歡這種方式因為我女兒還很小，她才八個月大欸，我不想讓她經歷我和太太之間的變動，對這麼小的孩子來說，這會讓她很混亂，為什麼有時候和爸爸在一起，有時才能見媽媽呢?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
To this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young, she should not and not suitable to go through the changes.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'she should not and is not suitable to go through the changes.'

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
I see, we will arrange the social worker to visit both parties. After they write down their report, we will arrange the next court time. Then we will let both parties to state their thoughts, is it clear?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After they write down their report, we will arrange the next court time.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of arranging the social worker to visit both parties.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of giving both parties an opportunity to state their thoughts.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好，社工人員來探訪沒有問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I agree with it, thank you.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today’s preparation procedure is for Ferry Johnson and Ms. Shi for child rearing procedure.Do both parties have lawyers?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the names of the children involved in the child rearing procedure.

我有委託律師。

I also have a lawyer.
我也有，我也是。

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'I', but the user used '我也是' which means 'I am' instead of '我也有' which means 'I have'.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today I am here; my real purpose is to understand what’s your status in this child rearing. Also, I want to know why both of you think you have the right to rear this child. Please focus on this point clearly. Besides, I know you are under the procedure of the case of divorce. I hope you can avoid the verbal attacking, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Today I am here; my real purpose is to understand what’s your status in this child rearing.' The correct word order should be 'Today I am here; my real purpose is to understand your status in this child rearing.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Also, I want to know why both of you think you have the right to rear this child.' The correct word order should be 'Also, I want to know why both of you think you have the right to rear this child.'

I understand.
我瞭解。

了解。
Yes, I do.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
So now, I will ask some question for plaintiff. Why you want to fight for the right for rearing your child? As I know, you don’t have the fall-time job in Taiwan now. You are a foreigner. Why do you think you are more proper than the defense that you can rear your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'fall-time' is incorrect. It should be 'full-time'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the defense' does not make sense in this context. It should be 'the other party' or 'the defendant'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the reason for wanting to fight for the right to rear the child.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The translation does not provide any context or background information.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望能把我的孩子判給我是因為有一些考慮的。第一點，我的老婆沒有跟我們住在一起，我想在那看著我女兒長大。此外我聽說我老婆跟別人住。如果那是真的的話，我非常懷疑她是否有能力給們的女兒最好的照顧。因此我希望能得到全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我希望能把我的孩子判給我是因為有一些考慮的'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that your wife is under the procedure of a divorce case and she doesn’t live with you. Is that right? Also, you suspected that she is living with other man. Are those concerns that you think you don’t want your daughter to live with your wife?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
沒錯，那些是我主要的顧慮。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
As to your financial status, if you got the custody of your daughter, how can you raise her up?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How can you raise her up?' instead of 'If you got the custody of your daughter, how can you raise her up?'

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有全職工作是真的。但是我有幾分臨時工可以讓我有固定的收入，我認為我的收入足夠讓我和我的女兒生活。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because those jobs are part-time jobs, can you calculate how much can you earn each month?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均大約有四到五個兼職。大約可以讓我賺到一萬五千元台幣每個月。有時候如果我有新的工作的話我會有新的收入。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '大約可以讓我每個月賺到一萬五千元台幣。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'bring me' as '讓我' is not accurate. A more appropriate translation would be '給我' or '帶來給我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about having new projects and the possibility of having more income.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I have another question. If you have the custody of your daughter, will you bring her to Canada and never come back? The reason why I ask you that question is because although you have the custody of your daughter, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter to your country that means you will violate the right of your wife to visit your daughter. What’s your point about this case?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the father not returning to the country.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待了有五年了，我有居留證而且我喜歡這個地方。到目前為止我並沒有任何計畫打算離開台灣。而且我確信我的女兒有權力見到她的父母。在這裡我要強調的是:雖然我和我的老婆正在打離婚官司，但是我絕對不會切斷她們的關係。在我們打離婚官司的程序中，我時常會寄我們女兒的照片給我老婆看。我也時常安排出去，我們三個一起出遊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我在台灣已經待了有五年了' should be '我已經在台灣待了五年了'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean that recently you will not return to your mother country, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不，有可能因為我的媽媽已經年老了也生病了。即使我回去但我也不會待太久，我甚至不會考慮把我女兒一起帶去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "即使我回去但我也不會待太久" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "即使我回去，我也不會待太久".

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
so now, I will ask some question for other party. You don’t live with your husband, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'separated' should agree with the plural subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you have the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is necessary for clarity.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
Before you have the case, you didn’t live together.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the couple stopped living together before the divorce lawsuit was filed.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
Who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I bring my son of my first marriage together.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? What is your marriage time with the plaintiff?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'husband' is not an accurate translation for '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So now, we are talking about the custody of the daughter which is you and your second husband have.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is eight-year old and my daughter is eight months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'son' and 'daughter' in number.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
After you leave your home, who live with your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because when I leave my home, my daughter was only two months so I worked her out in order to take care of her.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Because my daughter was only two months old when I moved out, she still needed my care, so she stayed with me.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the daughter still needed the user's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Where is your daughter now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '那現在孩子在誰那裏？' as 'Where is your daughter now?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks 'Who is the child with now?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
My daughter is in my husband’s house.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The correct word order should be 'My daughter is at my husband's house.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you have any agreement that your daughter live with you first and later she lives with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I left my house, I live in a small house, but the original one is bigger. According to the environment, my husband’s house is better for my child.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '交給' is translated as 'for' instead of 'to'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstance that your house is not good enough, your daughter lives with your husband is a better choice, isn’t that right? Why you want to own the custody of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you want to own the custody of your daughter?'

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I spent ten months to have my daughter. How can I endure that I cannot see her in the future? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian and he doesn’t have a full-time job. Also, he may leave Taiwan to Canada. As a result, I may not see my daughter in the future. So I hope I can fight for the custody of my daughter.
semantic conversion	omission of details	omitted the fact that she gave birth to the daughter
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrectly translated '懷胎十個月' as 'spent ten months' instead of 'carried for ten months'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omitted the fact that her husband's job is not stable in Taiwan
semantic conversion	omission of details	omitted the fact that her husband may return to Canada
semantic conversion	omission of details	omitted the fact that she wants to fight for custody of her daughter

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
How can you afford the expense for your daughter in your financial status?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we are still under the procedure of divorce case. I want to have the right to live in my husband’s house after the divorce. According to the environment, my husband’s house is suitable for my daughter to grow. As to my financial status, I have provided an asset list to the court. Besides, I have a regular full-time job. I earn about forty thousand NT dollars a month. I think I have the ability to take care of my daughter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How’s your divorce case? When is the result be made about time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the current status of the divorce case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include a question about the expected time for the judgment.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. This Friday we will have a court again. I will inform the judge in that court to make the decision earlier.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I will inform the judge in that court to make the decision earlier.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the divorce case, which is important context in the original text.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok, the court will have social workers to visit both of you, you and your husband. And make the evaluation to the situation that you and your husband’s accompanying your daughter. We will see the evaluation to decide the best choice for your daughter. So before the evaluation, I want to ask both of you that can you share the custody of your daughter? What is share custody is that your daughter will live with your husband for a period of time and later she will leave with you.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'you and your husband’s accompanying your daughter'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'We will see the evaluation to decide the best choice for your daughter'
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	Missing article in the sentence: 'So before the evaluation'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence: 'can you share the custody of your daughter?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence: 'What is share custody is that your daughter will live with your husband for a period of time and later she will leave with you.'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
基本上我不太贊同這個決議，因為我的女兒太小了，她才八個月大。我不想要她在我和我老婆之間換來換去。以我女兒現在的年紀來講，如果她一下子跟她媽媽住、一下子跟她爸爸住，這會讓她搞混。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
To that point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young, so it’s not proper and should not use that method.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Ok, now we arrange the schedule of social worker first. After they make a report, we will arrange the court day to give you the opportunity to state yourself, is that ok?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Now we first arrange the schedule of the social worker.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social worker' in the sentence, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation also omits the mention of 'give you the opportunity to state yourself' in the sentence, which is another important detail.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
OK 沒問題。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'OK' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'fine' in this context.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I am ok, too.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Explain why you urged to get child rearing right. So far you don’t have the full time job in Taiwan. Basically, you are the foreigner. In this case, why did you think you have the better right to get this?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望能把所有的撫養權判給我，因為有兩個原因，首先，我太太沒有和我們住在一起，我希望能看到我女兒在這邊長大。此外，我聽到消息說我老婆和別的男人住在一起，如果情況真的如此，那我懷疑我女兒能否得到最完善的照顧，因此，我希望能得到所有的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence structure.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
In other words, your wife lived with another man when you had the divorce case. Besides, you also have the doubt she lives with another man. Under this circumstance, you are not willing to give the sole custody to her.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the wife lived with another man during the divorce case, while the original text only mentions that the wife no longer lives with the user.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the information that the wife is currently involved in a divorce case with the user.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這些就是我主要的考量

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Concerning about the financial status, if you get the custody, what will you do?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
的確，我現在沒有拿到一個全職工作，但是我有幾份兼職的工作，可以讓我保持一個穩定的收入，我相信這個金錢來源，足夠讓我養活我們
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有幾份兼職的工作'.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mention you have several part-time jobs. Because those are part-time jobs, can you tell the amount conservatively?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific information about the estimated monthly income.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我大概有四到五份兼職工作，全部總計每個月大概可以有五萬的收入，如果有接到新的企劃，說不定能賺更多。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
So, another question would be that if you get the sole custody with your daughter, would you bring her to Canada and stay in Canada forever and would not come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask this question is that even though you get the custody, your wife still has the visitation right to see your daughter. If you bring your daughter to Canada, it will become that you isolate your daughter from your wife. At this point, what is your opinion?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'would not come back to Taiwan' should be 'would not come back to Taiwan forever'.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已在台灣待了四五年，我有居留證也喜歡這個地方，目前為止，我沒有任何計畫打算離開台灣。我認為我女兒有權可以看到我們雙方，我想強調的是即便我和我老婆在打離婚官司，但沒有打算切斷她們母女之間的關係。在整個離婚訴訟中，我也常寄女兒的圖片給我妻子看，我甚至還計畫讓她和女兒一起出遊，讓他多看看我們的女兒
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我已在台灣待了四五年' is incorrect. It should be '我已經在台灣待了四五年'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我認為我女兒有權可以看到我們雙方'. It should be '我認為我女兒有權看到我們雙方'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker has an ARC (Alien Resident Certificate).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker regularly sends pictures of their daughter to their wife during the divorce case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker arranges outings to encourage their wife to spend time with them and their daughter.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
What you mean is that you have no intention to come back to Canada, Right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '母國' as 'Canada' instead of the correct translation 'home country'.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
有可能回加拿大也可能是因為我母親又老又病，所以我必須得回去，就算我回去，也不會待太久，我不會考慮帶我女兒回去的可能。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我不會考慮帶我女兒回去的可能" is incorrect. It should be "我不會考慮帶我的女兒回去的可能".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase "No, I may go back to Canada" in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase "However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long" in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase "I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me" in the translation.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
I will ask questions for the other side. You did not live with your husband, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
We are separated for at least six months.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'are' should be in the present tense to match the original text.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
 That is to say is that before you file the case, you did not live together, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So, let me ask you about your living status. I mean whom do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son who is born in my first marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'son'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? What is the marriage with the defendant?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So, you are fighting for the child rearing right. Who is the child you fight with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? How old is your daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How old is your son?' and 'How old is your daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old. My daughter is eight months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you leave out home, did your daughter come with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I left out home, I bring my daughter with me because she was just two months old at that time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'When I left home, I brought my daughter with me.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needed the user's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Who live with your daughter?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'your daughter', so it should be 'Who lives with your daughter?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
My daughter lives with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between you and him? Originally, your daughter lives with you. Why did your daughter live with him now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '有什麼協議' as 'Is there any agreement', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order should be 'Why did your daughter live with him now?' instead of 'Why did your daughter live with him now?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '中間' which means 'in between' in the original text. This omission changes the meaning of the sentence.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place I live so far is small. Originally, our house was much bigger.Concerning for the environment, I think my husband’s house is better. I get my daughter to him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'I get my daughter to him' is incorrect. It should be 'I give my daughter to him.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
 For the objective circumstance, what I mean is that if your place has no change, it would be not good for your daughter. Why did you want to get the custody?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter with hard effort. How could I live without her? Besides, my husband is Canadian and his job is not stable. He has high possibility of coming back to Canada. In this way, I may not see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I want to get the custody.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '懷胎十個月' as 'with hard effort' instead of 'carried for ten months'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '生下來的阿' as 'daughter' instead of 'gave birth to her'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'with hard effort' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'my daughter'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the user being the mother of the daughter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the husband being Canadian.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the husband's job not being stable.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the husband's possibility of returning to Canada.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the user's desire to fight for custody.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your finical status, could you explain how you afford your daughter’s raising fee?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far we are in the progress of divorce case. I want to ask where my husband lives so far. For the finical status, I think that house will be suitable for my daughter. I have provided a piece of asset for the court. In addition to that, I have stable job which I can get forty thousand each month. I think I am able to raise my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I want to ask where my husband lives so far.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'where my husband lives so far' does not accurately convey the meaning of '我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡' which means 'I hope to be able to live in the house where my husband currently resides after the divorce.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information about providing a financial statement to the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention the reason for believing that the house is suitable for the daughter's growth.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I have stable job which I can get forty thousand each month.' It should be 'I have a stable job which pays me at least forty thousand each month.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the statement '我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒' which means 'I think I am capable of raising and taking care of my daughter.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
I want to the progress of your divorce case. Do you know when will the court make the judge or which day they will give answer?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure about that. We have to go to the court this Friday. I will send my concern to judge who is undergoing our case.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I will send my concern to the judge who is handling our divorce case.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'divorce case' as 'undergoing our case,' which does not accurately convey the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about wanting the judgment to come out quickly.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
OK, the court will send social workers to both sides to see our status. They will make the evaluation about how good is daughter to one side. The court will examine the report to make the decision which one is good to your daughter. Before that, will you consider the shared custody for both sides? The shared custody means that the daughter lives with father sometimes. For another time, she will live with mother.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'evaluate' as 'make evaluation'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'how good is daughter to one side'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of 'social workers' in the translation
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of 'to one side' in the translation
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of 'shared custody' as 'daughter lives with father sometimes'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不太喜歡這樣的建議，因為我們女兒還小，他現在只有八個月大，我不希望她經歷在父母之間的轉換。對這麼小的兒童而言，一下子和爸爸住，一下又跟媽媽住，這對他們是困擾混淆的
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'changes' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在父母之間的轉換' at the end of the sentence instead of after '經歷', resulting in a word order error.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
 At this point, I am agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young, she is not able to or supposed to live this kind of environment.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'am' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I am' instead of 'I is'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'live this kind of environment' does not accurately convey the meaning of '共同撫養的安排方式' which means 'arrangement of co-parenting'.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
 In this way, the court will send social workers. After they make full report, we will arrange the date of court. By doing so, both sides have rights to make statements, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After they make a full report, the court will send social workers.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after 'After they make a full report'. The correct sentence should be 'After they make a full report, the court will send social workers.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of arranging a court date after the social workers' report. The correct translation should include the sentence 'After they make a full report, we will arrange a court date.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation also omits the mention of giving both sides the opportunity to express their opinions. The correct translation should include the sentence 'This way, both sides will have the opportunity to express their opinions.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我可以接受社工拜訪
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no further question about that.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today is the preparation procedure for the child rearing between Shi Chiai Yon and Ferry Johnson. Do both party have the lawyer?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today, judge wants to clarify your different point of view on this custody case. And I would like to know that why both of you think that you’re more appropriate to raise this child. Please say your statement according to this point. And I also know that you’re on the divorce trial. Therefore, I hope there would be not(no) verbal attack in this court.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'And I would like to know that why both of you think that you’re more appropriate to raise this child.' The correct word order should be 'And I would like to know why both of you think that you’re more appropriate to raise this child.'
grammar and structure	omission of details	The word 'not' is missing in the sentence 'Therefore, I hope there would be not verbal attack in this court.' The correct sentence should be 'Therefore, I hope there would not be any verbal attack in this court.'

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I would like to ask some questions to the plaintiff. Why do you want to ask for the right of child rearing? As I know, now you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan. Plus, you’re also a foreigner. When it comes to the child rearing, why do you think that you’re more appropriate to raise the child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of asking questions to the plaintiff.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of asking why the plaintiff thinks they are more appropriate to raise the child.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我想要請求我孩子的扶養權基於以下兩個原因。首先我的太太現在已經沒有和我同住了。我想要看著我的孩子成長。此外我也聽說我的太太現在和另一名男子同住，所以就此原因我很懷疑她是否能夠好好照顧小孩，因此我想要要求全權的扶養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我想要要求全權的扶養權' should be '我想要要求全權扶養權'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that though you’re still on the divorce trial, you two didn’t live together now? Also you doubt that she is live with another man? Is that the reason that you don’t want to give your daughter to be taken care from(by) her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Is that the reason that you don’t want to give your daughter to be taken care from(by) her?' is incorrect. It should be 'Is that the reason that you don’t want to give your daughter to her to be taken care of?'

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這是我主要的考量。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
In addition, as for the financial status, if you have the custody, how would you like to raise your daughter?

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
事實上，我現在的確沒有全職的工作。但是我現在有打好幾份工、有固定的收入，我認為我的收入足夠養活我自己和我的女兒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb phrase '有打好幾份工' should come before the subject '我'.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
Do you mention that you have several part-time jobs? Because they’re all part-time jobs, so can you promise that how much you will receive as regular income per month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均會打四到五個工。大概總收入是五萬元。有時候如果我接到新的工作，我就會有更多的收入。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我平均會打四到五個工' is incorrect. It should be '我平均會打四到五個工作'.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The word 'part-time' is missing in the translation. It should be '我平均會打四到五個兼職工作'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'bring' should be in the future tense to match the original text. It should be '他們將會給我大約五萬元的收入每個月'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about having new projects and the possibility of earning more income. It should be '有時候，如果我有新的專案，我可能會有更多的收入'.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another question is that would you bring your daughter back to Canada if you get the custody. The reason why I’m asking this question is that even if you receive the custody, but your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada that means you use another way to separate your daughter and your wife and that’s violated the visitation right. What do you have to say upon this point?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the custody being for the daughter.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了。我已經拿到居留證了而且我也很喜歡這個地方。至今我還沒有要離開台灣。尤其我也認為我的女兒應該要有權力可以時常看到她的雙親。我想要強調的是儘管我們現在正在打離婚訴訟，但我並沒有想要把她和我太太拆散的意思。在我們打離婚官司的期間我常常有寄女兒的照片給她啊。我甚至有安排她們一起出去讓她們有更多的機會相處。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我已經拿到居留證了而且我也很喜歡這個地方' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我已經拿到居留證了，而且我也很喜歡這個地方。'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence '我想要強調的是儘管我們現在正在打離婚訴訟，但我並沒有想要把她和我太太拆散的意思。' The correct form should be '我想要強調的是儘管我們現在正在打離婚訴訟，但我並沒有想要把她和我太太拆散。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'my daughter' in the sentence '我想要強調的是儘管我們現在正在打離婚訴訟，但我並沒有想要把她和我太太拆散的意思。' The correct translation should include '我女兒' to indicate 'my daughter'.
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	The translation does not include the cultural reference of 'ARC' (Alien Resident Certificate) in the sentence '我已經拿到居留證了而且我也很喜歡這個地方。' The correct translation should include '外僑居留證' to accurately convey the meaning.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
Do you mean that you don’t have the intention to go back to Canada recently?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
 不會，我只是可能會因為我母親年長而且生病的原因回去而已。就算我回去了我也不會待太久。我更不會考慮說會把女兒帶過去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我只是可能會因為我母親年長而且生病的原因回去而已' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只是可能因為我母親年長而且生病的原因回去而已'.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
 Then I would like to ask a few questions to the other party. Are you living with your husband now or not?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes. We separated for about six month.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'separated' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'We separated' instead of 'We separated'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you raise the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Maybe about two month ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is crucial for understanding the context.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That means before you filed the divorce case you two hadn’t lived together, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
Now do you live with someone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son and is from my ex-husband.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'son', so it should be 'is from my ex-husband'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
You said that your son belongs to your first husband, so what is(how about) this time?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So let me clarify this. The daughter is the children(child) between you and your second husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'children' was translated as 'child', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and mu daughter is just eight months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you went out to live, whom did your daughter stay with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I lived out, my daughter is just two months, so my daughter needs a lot of care, so she lived with me at that time.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense 'was' to match the past tense of 'lived out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the daughter still needs the user's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Now, who have(has) the child now?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'child', so it should be 'has' instead of 'have'.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
She lives with my husband now.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you have any agreement? Why did your daughter live with you and now don’t(doesn’t) and lives with your husband now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '協議' as 'agreement' instead of 'arrangement'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'don't' instead of 'doesn't' to match the singular subject 'daughter'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'live' in the second part of the sentence, resulting in a missing verb.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'husband' in the second part of the sentence, resulting in a missing noun.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
I moved to a smaller place and my husband’s home is bigger, so my daughter stays with him. It’s a more appropriate environment for my daughter, so I leave my daughter to him.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is referring to her husband as '先生' (husband) in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'leave' instead of 'leaves' in the sentence 'so I leave my daughter to him', resulting in subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is referring to her daughter as '孩子' (child) in the original text.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances, I mean the living environment, don’t change, it’s still not good for your daughter, right? Then why would you like to file for the custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why would you like to file for custody?'

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I was pregnant for totally ten months and have her. How could I leave her alone? In addition, my husband is a Canadian. He doesn’t have a regular job. He doesn’t have fixed income. And maybe one day he will go back to Canada. If that’s the case, maybe I will never see my daughter. Therefore I would like to receive my daughter’s custody.
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect use of past tense in 'I was pregnant for totally ten months and have her'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'How could I leave her alone?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in 'He doesn’t have a regular job. He doesn’t have fixed income.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'And maybe one day he will go back to Canada.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '生下來的阿' in 'I have her.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '我不就見不到女兒了嗎？' in 'maybe I will never see my daughter.'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of 'totally' in 'I was pregnant for totally ten months.'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of 'alone' in 'How could I leave her alone?'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of 'maybe' in 'And maybe one day he will go back to Canada.'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of 'maybe' in 'If that’s the case, maybe I will never see my daughter.'

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Can you explain further on the point of financial status to proof that you can raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we’re still on the divorce case. I hope the result would be that my daughter will still live at the place that my husband lives in now. That would be a really good place for my daughter to grow up. As for my personal financial status, I have provide(d) the court my asset list. In addition I have a regular income per month. Every month I receive over 40,000 dollars. I think I have the ability to raise my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in 'provide(d) the court my asset list'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Missing subject-verb agreement in 'Every month I receive over 40,000 dollars'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So how’s your divorce case? How does the process go? Is there a set time that the result will come out?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. We will have the divorce court this Friday. I hope I can state my hope to that judge that I want the result to come out soon.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Then we will sent(send) social workers to both of your parties. Besides, we will evaluate how you two take care of your child. We will consider their report and see who will be more appropriate to raise the child. Before that, I would like to ask both of you, do you have the will to have shared custody. The shared custody means that the child lives with one of the parent for a period of time and lives with the other for another period of time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	sent -> send
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	we will sent -> we will send
grammar and structure	omission of details	sent to both of your parties -> sent to both of your parties and
grammar and structure	word order errors	both of your parties and -> both parties
grammar and structure	tense errors	we will evaluate -> we will be evaluating
grammar and structure	word order errors	how you two take care of your child -> how you take care of your child
grammar and structure	word order errors	see who will be more appropriate to raise the child -> see who will be more appropriate for raising the child
grammar and structure	word order errors	do you have the will to have shared custody -> do both of you have the will to have shared custody
grammar and structure	word order errors	The shared custody means that the child lives with one of the parent for a period of time and lives with the other for another period of time -> The shared custody means that the child lives with one parent for a period of time and with the other parent for another period of time

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不是很贊成因為我們的孩子還很小。她只有八個月大而已欸，我不想要她一直經歷環境上的改變，在我和我太太之間來來去去的。對一個年紀還這麼小的孩子而言，如果她要一下跟爸爸住，一下跟媽媽住，她可能會很混亂。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this point, I agree with him. Our daughter is still young and little and it’s not appropriate to have the shared custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out critical context

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Since that, we will sent(send) the social workers first. When they hand in their report, we will set another court. Then you will have the opportunities to state your opinion.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'We will sent the social workers first.' It should be 'We will send the social workers first.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'out' in the sentence 'When they hand in their report, we will set another court.' It should be 'When they hand out their report, we will set another court.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'the' in the sentence 'Then you will have the opportunities to state your opinion.' It should be 'Then you will have the opportunity to state your opinion.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
是的，我同意讓社工來探視。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'let' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
inappropriate cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the idiomatic expression 'social workers' visits' to the target language, resulting in a literal translation that may not convey the intended meaning.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no problems.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today the court is to realize your will at child rearing. The court also like to know that each of you, what privilege you have to raise this child.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
The plaintiff, why is your reason for you to ask child rearing? As far as I know, you don’t have a full time job in Taiwan.Also you are a foreigner. In the case of strive for child rearing, what do you think you are more capable of?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits important information from the original text.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望得到我孩子全部的扶養權，因為我覺得這樣對他比較好。 第一個理由，我太太之後不會跟我們住在一起了。我想要看著我的女兒成長。而且我聽說我的太太已經跟別的男人同居一起了。如果真的是那樣的話我懷疑他能提供給我女兒一個好的環境。因此我希望我能得到全部的扶養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我希望得到我孩子全部的扶養權' should be '我希望得到全部的扶養權，我孩子'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning: '我覺得這樣對他比較好' should be '我覺得這樣對她比較好' to match the gender of '我的女兒'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of details: The user did not mention the two concerns mentioned in the original text

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that though you are still preparing divorce, and your wife has already lived with other man? And you also doubt that she lived with other man? It is because of that you don’t want your daughter to live with her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Important details from the original text are missing in the translation.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，這就是我主要考慮的原因

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
About your financial status, what are you going to do after you gain your daughter’s sole custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實是沒有一份全值的工作但是我有間很多份工作，這些工作就能提供給我穩定的收入。我認為我的收入足夠能支付我的生活和照顧我女兒
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned you have several part-time job Because all the jobs you said is part-time, can you expect how steady income every moth?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
平均來說，有四到五個兼職工作所以加總起來大概有一個月五萬塊如果有時候有些新的案件的話，我還會有些新的收入
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another question I want to ask you will you take your daughter back to Canada after you get her whole custody?The reason I ask this question is because that even of you get the sole custody, your wife may have the chance to come to see her.If you decide to bring your daughter back to your country, that will be another way that you cut the tie with her mother.About this point what is your reason?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the wife having visitation rights.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'that will be another way that you cut the tie with her mother', which is not present in the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經再台灣待了五年了我有這裡的居留證，而且我也很喜歡這邊。到目前為止我還沒有打算要離開台灣 而且我也覺得我的女兒有他的權利可以來看兩方的父母。我想澄清一點就是，雖然我和他母親正準備要離婚，但我沒有打算要切斷他們母女的聯繫 在我們打官司的這段期間，我也會固定地寄女兒的照片給她我也會安排一些活動讓我三個能一起出去。

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in sentence: '我也會安排一些活動讓我三個能一起出去' should be '我也會安排一些活動讓我們三個能一起出去'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean currently you don’t have any plan to go back to your country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
對，我有可能會回去就是因為我媽媽年老了可能生病。可是就算我回去加拿大，我也不會在那邊久留。而且我也不會考慮把我女兒一起帶回去
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "而且我也不會考慮把我女兒一起帶回去" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "而且我也不會考慮把我女兒帶回去一起".

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
So now let me ask the defendant. Now you are not live with your husband, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Now you do not live with your husband, is that right?'

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been separated for six moths.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'moths' should be 'months' to agree with the plural subject 'six'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you decided to file the case of divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two moths ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'applied' in the translation.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So you mean before you file the divorce case, you were no longer live together?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So what id you living condition? I mean, who did you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son of my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
The first marriage? So what is the time marriage with the plaintiff?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So now the custody you are fighting for is with your second husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對。
yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? How old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven yeas old and my daughter is eight months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, the daughter is with you or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'the daughter is' instead of 'the daughter are'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out, my daughter is little and she needs my taking care of.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense 'was' to match the past tense of 'moved out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter was only 2 months old at the time.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'she needs my taking care of', which is redundant and not present in the original text.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So now the child is with who?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now she is with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Now she is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between you? Why the daughter was with you and now with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '原來女兒跟你' as 'the daughter was with you' instead of 'originally the daughter was with you'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'was' before the subject 'the daughter' in the sentence 'the daughter was with you'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place I later lived is smaller, the original house with my husband is bigger. So as the living environment, the house with my husband is better for her.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So if you don’t change, change your living condition, it is still she lives with your husband is better, isn’t it? So why do you want to have the sole cutosty?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
As your financial status, can your elaborate more details how you would like to take care of your daughter?

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
May I ask the ??Do you know when the result will made?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'divorce cases' and 'progress' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure about this.We will go to the court this Friday.I will have the court that the case can be done as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, the court will plan the social workers to visit both of youThey will made the evaluations of the condition you with your childAnd the court will consider the result according to their evaluationsBefore we started that, will you consider the share custody? The shared custody means that the child with the mother for a time and with the father for the rest of time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: 'They will made the evaluations of the condition you with your child' should be 'They will make evaluations of the condition you and your child'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: 'Before we started that, will you consider the share custody?' should be 'Before we start, will you consider shared custody?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of 'the' before 'social workers' in sentence: 'the court will plan the social workers to visit both of you' should be 'the court will plan for the social workers to visit both of you'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of 'the' before 'result' in sentence: 'the court will consider the result according to their evaluations' should be 'the court will consider the result according to their evaluations'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
現階段我不同意這個做法，因為她還太小 她才八個月大我不想因為我們的關係讓她受到影響像他這麼小的小孩，要他一下跟著爸爸，一下跟著媽媽，這實在太辛苦了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree with my husband at this point.Our daughter is too young to shared custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'daughter'.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Well okay, we will arrange the social worker first.After they made the results, we will decide another date for court.To provide both of you to elaborate more.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the social worker's visit in their translation.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我可以接受社工的安排
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no further questions, thank you.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today we are going to proceed the preparatory procedure of case dealing with child rearing custody. Do both parties have your lawyer?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

我有委託律師。
Yes, I have a lawyer.

I also have a lawyer.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today the court aiming… aims at knowing the status and the thoughts of the two parties. The court would like to know the reason why each of you consider yourself is more suitable to keep the child. Please verify more… tell us more details about this… point. In addition, I know…the court knows the two parties…. is under the divorce case. So I hope that the two parties will not have any verbal attack to each other.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Plaintiff, I have some questions for you. Plaintiff, what’s the reason that you want to strive for the custody of raising your child? As far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan now. And you are a foreigner. In the case of fighting for the child rearing custody, why do you feel you will be more suitable?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What is the reason that you want to strive for the custody of raising your child?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'reason', so it should be 'What is the reason that you want to strive for the custody of raising your child?'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the plaintiff being a foreigner, which is an important detail in the original text.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user's translation adds the repetition of the word 'Plaintiff' at the beginning of each sentence, which is unnecessary.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望法院能判我女兒的全部撫養權給我, 那我有兩個理由.首先是, 我的太太已經沒有跟我們住在一起了, 我想要親眼看著我的孩子長大, 而且我也聽說我的太太已經跟別的男人同居了, 如果這事情是真的的話, 那我懷疑她有辦法給我們孩子最好的照顧, 因此我希望能得到所有的撫養權
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我希望法院能判我女兒的全部撫養權給我' should be '我希望法院能判給我女兒的全部撫養權'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我想要親眼看著我的孩子長大' should be '我想要親眼看著我的孩子長大'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我懷疑她有辦法給我們孩子最好的照顧' is translated as 'I doubt she can give our daughter the best care she deserves.' The word '照顧' means 'care' not 'the best care'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the phrase '因此我希望能得到所有的撫養權' which means 'Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.'

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean by that your wife hasn’t lived with you, even if you are now filing for the divorce case? And you also doubt that she lives with another man? Because of these situations that you are not willing to give her the right to raise the child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的,這就是我主要的原因

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
As for your personal financial status, what do you plan…..how do you plan to raise your daughter without a full-time job?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在的確沒有一份全職的工作, 但我身兼好幾份兼職工作, 而且帶給我一份穩定的收入, 我認為我賺來的錢是足夠我和我的女兒生活的

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs, since they are all part-time jobs, can you possibly count how much money you can make every month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'can you possibly count how much money you can make every month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我有四到五個兼職工作, 總加起來大概有台幣五萬塊, 如果有更多的計畫或工作給我的話, 我就可以得到更多的錢
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'on average' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another question I would like to ask you, after you have the rights…the custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and will not come back anymore? The reason why I ask you is that even if you get the custody, your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring the kid back to your country, it can be counted as a another way to cut the ties of the daughter with her mother. As for this point, what is your opinion?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits important information from the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了, 我有居留證, 而且我也喜歡這個地方, 到目前為止我並沒有打算要離開台灣, 而且我也認為我的女兒有權利見到她的雙方父母親, 我想強調的是, 雖然我和我的太太正在進行離婚官司, 但我絕對不會想要切斷他們的母子的連繫, 在我們打官司的期間, 我都會固定寄我女兒的照片給我的太太, 我也會安排出遊, 就是她和我, 以及我女兒一起出遊的機會
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我已經在台灣待了五年了' should be '我已經在台灣待了五年了'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '我女兒有權利見到她的雙方父母親' should be '我女兒有權利見到她的雙方父母親'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: '在我們打官司的期間' should be '在我們打官司的期間'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence: '我都會固定寄我女兒的照片給我的太太' should be '我都會固定寄我女兒的照片給我的太太'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in the sentence: '我也會安排出遊, 就是她和我, 以及我女兒一起出遊的機會' should be '我也會安排出遊, 就是她和我, 以及我女兒一起出遊的機會'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean that currently, recently, you don’t have the intention to go back to your country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
我可能會因為我的母親…在加拿大的母親比較老了或是病了而回國, 但就算我回去我也不會在那邊留很久, 我甚至不會考慮要把我的女兒帶去加拿大
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay I would like to ask another party. So now you don’t live with your husband now right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been separated for six months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
What’s the time when you file the divorce case
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you file the divorce case?'

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That is to say, before you file the case of divorce, you two didn’t live together.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So what’s your situation of your accommodation? I mean, who do you live with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son, which… who is from my first marriage
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	using 'which' instead of 'who' to refer to a person

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? So… what’s………. this marriage?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He’s my second husband
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'He is my second husband.'

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
The custody you’re striving for, is the custody of a daughter of your second husband, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is… are you daughter and your son?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'are' should agree with the plural noun 'daughter and son'.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is 7 year-old and my daughter is eight months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the plural subject 'children'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, was your daughter with you or with your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'was' instead.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out, because my daughter was 2 months …. in the year of 2 months, she needed me, so she was with me.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'because my daughter was 2 months old' instead of 'because my daughter was 2 months'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'old' after '2 months', which is an important detail in the original text.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
For now, where is your child, with you or your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
She is with my husband now.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The correct word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Was any agreement between you two, why was your daughter with you at first and then now with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place I moved in is smaller and the original house we lived in is bigger. Concerning the environment, I decided to give my daughter to my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I decided to give my daughter to my husband' instead of 'I decided to give my daughter to my husband.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
In the case of the objective circumstances, if your accommodation is still… that, it is not improved yet, is it better for your daughter? So why would you like to strive for the custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I borned her with 10 months. How could I bear the pain of being separated with her? Also, my husband is a Canadian, the jobs he has in Taiwan isn’t…aren’t very stable and he might go back to Canada. In that case, I cannot see my daughter anymore. That’s the reason why I would like to strive for my daughter’s custody.
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect verb form 'borned' instead of 'born'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'the jobs he has in Taiwan isn’t…aren’t very stable'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'I' in 'I cannot see my daughter anymore'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'so' in 'That’s the reason why I would like to strive for my daughter’s custody'

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Concerning your financial status, can you elaborate how would you like to arrange the money to raise your daughter?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'arrange' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'how' and 'would' in the translation.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we are under the divorce case, I hope to get the house we used to live together, that it the house my husband is living now. Concerning the environment, the house will be very suitable for my daughter to grow up. As for my financial status, I’ve provided the court…. my asset list. In addition, I have a stable job, which may have me owned 40,000 dollars at least. I think I can take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Concerning the environment, the house will be very suitable for my daughter to grow up.' The correct word order should be 'The house will be very suitable for my daughter to grow up, concerning the environment.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'As for my financial status, I’ve provided the court…. my asset list.' The correct form should be 'As for my financial status, I have provided the court with my asset list.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'I have a stable job, which may have me owned 40,000 dollars at least.' The correct form should be 'I have a stable job, which allows me to earn at least 40,000 dollars per month.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence 'I’ve provided the court…. my asset list.' The user did not specify whether the asset list was provided to the court or not.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence 'I have a stable job, which may have me owned 40,000 dollars at least.' The user did not mention the duration of the job or the frequency of the income.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
May I ask how your divorce case proceed? Do you know when the trial will be.. approximately will be?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure about that. We have to go to the court on Friday again. I will tell the court that I hope the trail and the result will come out as soon as possible
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I hope the result of the trial will come out as soon as possible.'

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok, the court will arrange the social workers to visit both parties, they will evaluate how you deal with your daughter…. The court will consider the result and decide what’s the best result for your daughter. Before that happens, I would like to ask the two parties, will you two consider the shared custody? That is, the child will accompany the mother for a period of time and then accompany with the father for another period of time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I would like to ask the two parties'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'shared custody' is translated as '共同撫養' which means 'joint custody' instead of 'shared custody'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不太喜歡這樣的決定, 因為我的女兒還太小了, 她才8個月大而已, 我不希望她在我和我妻子之間來來回回的, 對一個這麼小的孩子來說, 她會非常疑惑, 為什麼一下跟這個… 一下跟爸爸一下跟媽媽… 相處一段時間
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree with my husband at the point. Our daughter is too young, it will not be a good resolution to use the shared custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay, so we will arrange the visit of social workers first. After they make the report, we will set the court date afterward, and the both parties will have the chance to elaborate themselves, is that okay with you?

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Plaintiff, what is your reason to fight for the custody of children?As far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job regularly in Taiwan.Also you are a foreigner.In this case, why do you think you are the more appropriate person to have the custody of children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think you are the more appropriate person to have custody of the children?'

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望我可以獲得我女兒的全部撫養權，有以下兩個原因首先，我太太已經不和我們住在一起了我想要參與我女兒的成長過程此外，我還聽說我的…妻子已經和另一個男人同居了如果真的是那樣的話，我很懷疑她是不是能好好地照顧我的小孩因此，我希望我可以獲得全部扶養權
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我女兒的全部撫養權' (the sole custody of my daughter). The correct word order should be '全部撫養權的我女兒' (my daughter's sole custody).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我女兒的全部撫養權' (the sole custody of my daughter) is translated as 'the custody of my daughter' which does not convey the meaning of 'sole custody'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the reason for wanting sole custody, which is the wife living with another man and the doubt about her ability to provide the best care for the daughter.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that even you both still engage in the divorce case, your wife…already lived with another man?And you also doubt that she lived with another manBased on this situation, it is the reason why you don’t want to give the custody of children to your wife?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，那是我最主要的考量

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
In addition, concerning your personal financial status, do you really be able to raise your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實是沒有全職的工作但是我有許多的兼職工作，讓我有固定的收入我相信這些收入是足夠能讓我扶養我的女兒的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned that you have several part-time jobs.Because these jobs are all part-time, can you approximately come up the total regular income you will receive?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我大概有四到五份兼職工作平均每個月這些薪水加起來的話，大概會有五萬塊的薪水如果有時後有新的案子進來的話，我的收入就會更高
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'On average, I have four to five part-time jobs.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'bring me' as '這些薪水加起來的話' is incorrect. It should be translated as '給我帶來'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the currency 'NT$'. It should be translated as '大概會有五萬塊台幣的薪水'.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the phrase '如果有時後有新的案子進來的話' which is not present in the original text.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I also want to ask a question that if you…are granted with the custody of the child, will you bring the child back to Canada and never come back.The reason why I ask this question is that even if you are granted with the custody of the child, your wife still have the visitation right to the child.If you do bring your child back to Canada, it is kind of … behavior to cut the tie with your wife and the child.To this point, what is your explanation?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the possibility of not returning to the country after taking the child to Canada.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'are' before the subject 'you' in the first sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '變相的隔離她們母女見面' as 'cut the tie with your wife and the child', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我來台灣待了五年了我有居留證，我也很喜歡這個地方目前為止，我並沒有任何要回家加拿大的計畫我覺得我的孩子有權利見他們的父母的我想要強調的是，即使我和我的妻子仍在打離婚訴訟，但我沒有想將我的孩子與我的妻子完全隔離關係就在打離婚訴訟的期間，我也常常將孩子送去給我妻子那邊，讓他們有相處的時間我甚至還跟她約一些時間，希望她可以和我還有小孩共度一些時間
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我覺得我的孩子有權利見他們的父母的'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in sentence: '我想要強調的是，即使我和我的妻子仍在打離婚訴訟，但我沒有想將我的孩子與我的妻子完全隔離關係'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in sentence: '就在打離婚訴訟的期間，我也常常將孩子送去給我妻子那邊，讓他們有相處的時間'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in sentence: '我覺得我的孩子有權利見他們的父母的'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in sentence: '我來台灣待了五年了我有居留證'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in sentence: '我也很喜歡這個地方'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in sentence: '我並沒有任何要回家加拿大的計畫'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in sentence: '我甚至還跟她約一些時間，希望她可以和我還有小孩共度一些時間'

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
Therefore, you mean, in the recent period, you don’t have any plan to go to Canada? Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不，我還是有可能會回去加拿大的，因為我的母親很老了，而且她生病了即使我回去了，我也不會在那邊停留太久時間的我甚至不會考慮帶我的小孩一起回加拿大
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我還是有可能會回去加拿大的'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '我甚至不會考慮帶我的小孩一起回加拿大'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the mother being sick in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not staying long in Canada in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not considering taking the daughter with them in the translation.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Then I’m going to ask some questions to the other party.Do you…no longer live with your husband now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you no longer live with your husband now?'

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we …have lived separately for six months.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'have lived' should be in the present perfect tense 'have been living' to indicate an ongoing action.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
I filed the case around two months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is 'I'.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So, before you filed the divorce case, you…no longer lived with your husband already.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the couple no longer lived together before filing for divorce.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So can you tell me what is your … I mean who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son of my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? So what is … this marriage?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So now the custody … you are argue about is the daughter of your second marriage.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'the custody you are argue about', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'is' before 'the daughter', resulting in incorrect word order.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight-month old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the plural subject 'children'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out the house, was your daughter with your or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'was' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'was your daughter with you or your husband?'

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out the house, because my daughter … is still young, she went out with me.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'went' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'went out with me'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the daughter was only 2 months old at the time.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Then now … who does the child live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is living with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Now my daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why the daughter lived with you first and now is living with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '協議' as 'agreement' instead of 'husband'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'lived' before the subject 'daughter' in the translation.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I moved out, the house I lived is a little bit small. My husband’s house is bigger.In terms of the environment, I think my husband’s house is better for my child so I gave my daughter to him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'After I moved out, the house I lived is a little bit small.' It should be 'After I moved out, the house I lived in is a little bit small.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I gave my daughter to him' implies that the speaker gave their daughter away, which may not be the intended meaning. It would be more accurate to say 'I entrusted my daughter to him' or 'I left my daughter with him.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances don’t change, that is to say, …your daughter does live with your husband is a better choice.Then why do you want to be granted with the custody of your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter and I have spent ten months to give birth to her. I absolutely want her custody.In addition, my husband’s nationality is Canada. He also doesn’t have a full-time job. I’m concerning about that he might go back to Canada from time to time.In that case, doesn’t it mean that I can’t see my daughter?That is the reason why I want to be granted with the custody of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I absolutely want her custody' should be 'I want her custody absolutely'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'He also doesn’t have a full-time job' should be 'He also doesn’t have a stable job'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'I’m concerning about that he might go back to Canada' should be 'I’m concerned that he might go back to Canada'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after the phrase 'In that case'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the speaker wants to fight for custody of her daughter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the speaker's husband is Canadian.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the husband's job in Taiwan is not stable.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the speaker is concerned about not being able to see her daughter if her husband goes back to Canada.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the speaker wants to be granted custody of her daughter.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
In terms of your financial status, can you elaborate how can you raise your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far, we are still in the divorce case.I hope I can be granted with the right to live in the house of y husband.As far as the house is concerned, I think that place is pretty good for my daughter to live.As for my financial status, I already sent a document about my asset list to the court.Besides, I also have a job. Every month, I have approximately at least forty thousand dollars as an income.I think I do have the ability to raise my child.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I hope I can be granted with the right to live in the house of y husband.' It should be 'I hope I can be granted the right to live in my husband's house.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'As far as the house is concerned, I think that place is pretty good for my daughter to live.' It should be 'As far as the house is concerned, I think that place is pretty good for my daughter to live in.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'As for my financial status, I already sent a document about my asset list to the court.' It should be 'As for my financial status, I have already sent a document about my asset list to the court.'
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	Article error in the sentence 'Besides, I also have a job.' It should be 'Besides, I also have a job.'
grammar and structure	agreement errors in number or gender	Agreement error in the sentence 'Every month, I have approximately at least forty thousand dollars as an income.' It should be 'Every month, I have an income of at least forty thousand dollars.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
May I ask how is your divorce case going?Do you know when the verdict will come out about your divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case going?' instead of 'May I ask how is your divorce case going?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the part about the scheduled verdict or the approximate timing of the verdict.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure.We will have the court this Friday about the divorce case.I would like to tell the court that I hope the verdict of the divorce case will come out soon.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, we now will send some social workers to visit …both of you.In addition, they will evaluate your interaction with your child.We will …take their evaluation into account when deciding the verdict of this case.However, I want to ask that do both party would consider the joint custody.What joint custody means is that the child will spend some time with the Father and also the other time with Mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'we now will send some social workers' is incorrect. It should be 'we will now send some social workers'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'will' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'we will send' instead of 'we will send'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'send' should be in the present tense to match the context, so it should be 'we will send' instead of 'we will send'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after 'visit' to separate the two clauses in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'verdict' is not appropriate in this context. It should be 'decision' or 'outcome' instead.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'joint custody' is not accurately translated. It should be 'shared custody' or 'joint custody' instead.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of the social workers evaluating the interaction between the parents and the child.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The translation adds the phrase 'In addition' which is not present in the original text.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人是不想要這樣的裁定，因為我的女兒太小了她只有八個月大我不想她被我和我妻子之間送來送去的對於這樣歲數的小孩子來說，這樣的環境對他們來說也太混亂了吧，一下子和母親待一段時間，一下子和父親待一段時間
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我个人不想要这样的安排' (I personally do not want this arrangement).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '被我和我妻子之间送来送去' (being sent back and forth between me and my wife) is not an accurate translation of 'the changes between me and my wife'. The meaning is not properly conveyed.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '待' (stay) should agree with the subject '她' (she) in number. It should be '待一段时间' (stay for a period of time) instead of '待一段时间'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase '对于这样岁数的小孩子来说' (for a child at such a young age) is omitted in the translation, resulting in the loss of important information.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
To this point, I agree with my husband’s opinion.My daughter is too young. We shouldn’t and don’t want to accept this verdict of joint custody.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
To this case, we are going to send social workers for visitation.After social workers make the report, we will resume the case.And at that time, you will have the floor to elaborate your opinion.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'And at that time, you will have the floor to elaborate your opinion' is incorrect. It should be 'And at that time, you will have the opportunity to elaborate your opinion.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我對社工的部分沒有問題
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of being fine with social workers' visits.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I’m fine with that, too.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today we’re here for the preparatory procedure of Mr. Ferry Johnson and Ms. 彩雲石 concerning child custody. Do both parties have a lawyer?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'lawyer' from the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Your honor. Today I mainly want to verify the child custody in the marriage. I would also like to know that why both of you think that you can raise the child alone. Please elaborate this point further. Besides, I also know that both of you are also under the case of divorce. Therefore, I hope that both of you can avoid verbal attack in this court.

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence 'I would also like to know that why both of you think that you can raise the child alone.' It should be 'I would also like to know why both of you think that you can raise the child alone.'

I understand.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, defendant, may I ask you some questions? Why do you want to fight for the custody of your child? Based on my understanding, you don’t a fulltime job in Taiwan, and you’re a foreigner. In the process of the fighting for custody, what’s your advantages?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '希望能夠' as 'want to' instead of 'hope to' changes the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant not having a full-time job and being a foreigner.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that your wife is… when you’re fighting for the case of divorce, your wife no longer lives with you. Is that right? And you also doubt that she lives another man. Is it because of this kind of condition that you don’t want to share custody with her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這些都是我主要的顧慮

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Besides, concerning your financial status, if you’re granted with the custody, what do you plan to raise your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What do you plan to do to raise your child?'

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在的確沒有全職工作。但是我有很多兼職工作，這也有份固定的收入。我相信這份收入能夠支撐我和我女兒的生活。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在的確沒有全職工作。' instead of '現在的確我沒有全職工作。'

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. So because they’re all part-time jobs, so could you tell us that how much money will you gain on a regular basis.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
平均而言我有四到五個兼職工作。總共來說大概會有五萬塊的收入。有時候如果有新的計劃的時候，我也會有額外的收入。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '平均而言，我有四到五個兼職工作。'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '來說' should be in the present tense '來說'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the possibility of having more income with new projects.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
My another question is that will you bring your daughter back to Canada and no longer stays in Taiwan after you’re granted with the custody? The reason why I asked so is that even if you are granted with the custody, your wife may also be granted with the visitation right. If you bring your child back to Canada, you will become, to a degree, cut the tie between your wife and your child. To this, what’s your plea?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'daughter' in the translation, which is a critical detail in the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年。我有居留證，我也喜歡這個地方。目前為止我沒有任何離開台灣的計畫。特別是因為我認為我的女兒有權利見到爸爸媽媽。我想說的是，雖然我和我太太現在正在打離婚的官司，我從來沒有想過要切斷她和我女兒之間的聯繫。在整個離婚官司的過程中，我會固定寄女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至安排了一些行程，讓他和女兒能夠見面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我認為我的女兒有權利見到爸爸媽媽' is incorrect. It should be '我認為我的女兒有權利見到爸爸和媽媽'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean that in the short run you don’t have the plan to go back to Canada.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
我的確有回加拿大的打算，因為我母親年邁且身體不好。然而就算我回去加拿大的話我也不會待太久。我也不會考慮把女兒帶著一起回加拿大的可能。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我的確有回加拿大的打算" is incorrect. It should be "我確實有回加拿大的打算".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我也不會考慮把女兒帶著一起回加拿大的可能" is incorrect. It should be "我也不會考慮把女兒帶著一起回加拿大的可能性".

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now, Ms. 石, I have some questions for you. Don’t you live with your husband anymore?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been separated for six months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case of divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you file the case of divorce?'

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
In other words, much earlier before your filing divorce case, you no longer lives with him. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So could you tell us your living condition? I mean, who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son in my first marriage.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? What the marriage between Mr. Johnson.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He’s my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So, we’re dealing with the custody of your second husband and your daughter in your second marriage.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the ongoing dispute over child custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the plural form 'we're' instead of the singular form 'you're' to match the subject 'you'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the ongoing dispute over child custody.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter.'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, your daughter stays with who? You or your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I was moving out, because she’s only two months old, so she stayed with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needed the mother's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
What does your daughter stay with?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'stay' is not appropriate in this context. It should be 'is with' or 'is staying with'.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now she lives with my husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there some kind of arrangement between you two? Why was the daughter staying with you, and then is staying with your husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '協議' as 'arrangement' instead of 'agreement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'is' before the subject 'the daughter' in the second sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '原來' which means 'originally' in the first sentence.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The apartment after I moved out is quite smaller. The original house is bigger. In terms of the living condition, my husband can provide a better environment.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The apartment after I moved out is quite smaller.' The correct word order should be 'The apartment I moved out of is quite smaller.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the original house is bigger' is translated as 'the original house is bigger.' The correct translation should be 'my husband can provide a better environment.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is giving the children to the husband. The correct translation should include this detail: 'So, I gave the children to my husband.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances aren’t changed. Your living condition isn’t good for your daughter, isn’t it? Then why do you hope for the custody of your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question structure.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Therefore, I hope to fight for the custody. As for your financial status, could you elaborate that how you are going to raise your child.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are currently in the case of divorce. I hope that I can get my husband’s house after the case. So in terms of the living condition, that house is very appropriate for my daughter. And as for my personal financial status, I have provided the court a copy of my asset list. Besides, I have a fulltime job. I can earn around 40000 per month. I think I am able to raise my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'So in terms of the living condition, that house is very appropriate for my daughter.' The correct word order should be 'That house is very appropriate for my daughter in terms of the living condition.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I can earn around 40000 per month.' The correct form should be 'I can earn around 40000 dollars per month.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'I think I am able to raise my daughter.' The correct form should be 'I think I will be able to raise my daughter.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So how’s your divorce case going? When will the court’s decisions be made? I mean do you roughly know the time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case going?' instead of 'So how's your divorce case going?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the part about whether there is a scheduled time for the court's decision to be made.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure about it. This week we have another court. I want express my idea to the court that I wish the court can be finished as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I want to express my idea to the court.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '希望判決能夠盡快出來' as 'I wish the court can be finished as soon as possible.' This does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text, which is a desire for the judgment to be delivered quickly.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Now let us do this. The court will arrange social workers to your children. And they will make evaluation about the relationship between you and your child. That will be the court’s reference to see who is better for the child. Before that I want to ask that will you consider the possibility of shared custody? The definition of shared custody is that the child stays with father for some time and stays with the mother for another time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Now let us do this' is incorrect. It should be 'Now let's do this.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '本院' as 'the court' instead of 'this court'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the social workers visiting both parties involved in the case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the court considering the social workers' report to make a decision.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the court determining the best arrangement for the child.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the possibility of shared custody being discussed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the definition of shared custody.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不喜歡這個提案，因為我女兒還太小，他只有八個月大。我不希望他在我和我太太之間搬來搬去。這個方式對這麼年幼的小孩來說太混淆了，怎麼可以讓她一下跟爸爸住一下跟媽媽住呢
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
Concerning this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small. She is not supposed to go through the process of shared custody.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter's age, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'is' instead of 'should' to convey the idea of obligation.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So we will have the social workers get to you first. After they finish the report, we will arrange the court date to give the opinion rights of both parties.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After they finish the report, we will arrange the court date.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social workers' in the sentence, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social workers' in the sentence, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social workers' in the sentence, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social workers' in the sentence, which is an important detail.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我對社工探視沒有意見
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '我對社工探視沒有意見' translates to 'I have no objection to social workers' visits,' which is different from the original text's meaning of 'Yes, I am fine with social workers' visits.'

沒有問題，謝謝。
I’m fine with it too, thanks.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'As I know' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '爭取子女撫養權' as 'custody of your child' instead of 'child custody rights'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'have' instead of 'has' in the question 'Plaintiff, why do you want to have the custody of your child?'
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user did not use appropriate honorific language or formal tone in addressing the plaintiff.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望得到孩子的扶養權因為下列的原因。首先，我的老婆不再陪著我們。我想要跟著我的女兒一起成長。此外，我知道我的老婆和別的男人現在正在一起。如果那是真的，我很懷疑我的老婆是否有辦法好好照顧我們的女兒。因此，我希望能爭取全部扶養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我希望得到孩子的扶養權因為下列的原因' (I hope to get custody of the child for the following reasons). The correct word order should be '因為下列的原因，我希望得到孩子的扶養權' (For the following reasons, I hope to get custody of the child).

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that you are in the case of divorce with your wife, and she doesn’t live with you now? And you think she lives with other man? Because of this concern, you don’t want to your child lives with her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
沒錯，那就是我所擔憂的。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Furthermore, it’s about your financial status. If you have the custody of your child, what’s your plan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
沒錯，我現在在台灣並沒有全職的工作。但是我有七份兼職工作，那使我的收入跟全職收入一樣多。我相信這樣的收入足夠負擔我和我女兒的生活費。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'regular income' as 'the same amount as a full-time income', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '七份兼職工作' (seven part-time jobs) before the verb '有' (have), which is incorrect in Chinese.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mention that you have many part time jobs. Because all of them are part time jobs, you think you may have how much fixed income every month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'how much fixed income do you think you may have every month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有四到五份兼職工作。平均來說，我一個月會有五萬元收入。有時候如果我額外接收到工作，我會有更多的收入。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
For the other question that I want to ask is that if you get the custody of your child, will you go to Canada and never come back again? I asked the question just because even if you have the custody, your wife may remain the visitation right. If you bring your child to your country, it may become a problem that you deliberately separate the child and your wife. For this point, what’s your point?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'If you bring your child to your country, it may become a problem that you deliberately separate the child and your wife.' The correct word order should be: 'If you bring your child to your country, it may become a problem that you deliberately separate the child from your wife.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '变相的隔离她们母女见面' is translated as 'deliberately separate the child and your wife,' which does not accurately convey the meaning of '隔离' (isolate/separate). The correct translation should be 'isolate them from seeing each other' or 'prevent them from meeting each other.'

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣生活了五年，我擁有居留證而且我喜愛這個地方，到目前為止我沒有離開台灣的任何打算，而且我的女兒有權利見到我和我太太。我必須強調的是，即使我和我太太正在進行離婚官司，但我並沒有想要切斷小孩和我太太的關係。在打官司的期間，我也有將我女兒的照片傳給我老婆。我甚至鼓勵他和我女兒見面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '而且我的女兒有權利見到我和我太太' should be '而且我的女兒有權利見到我和我太太'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So, you mean that you don’t have the plan to go back your country, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'So, you mean that you don’t have the plan to go back to your country, right?'

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
也不是這樣說，我也是有可能回去看我的母親，因為她已經很老了。就算我回去的話，我也不會在那邊待很久，我甚至考慮帶我女兒一起去的可能性。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that they are considering taking their daughter with them, while the original text explicitly states that they would not consider this possibility.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Ok. I want to ask the question of the other party. So, do you live with your husband now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
We live separately for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'have lived' instead of 'live'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file a divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you file for a divorce case?'

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Maybe two months before.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is necessary for clarity.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So, before you filed the case, you didn’t live with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
What’s you living status? I mean, you live with whom?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son who is from my first marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'son'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the question word '那' (which) and the verb '跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次' (how many times have you been married).

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'He is my second husband.'

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So, the custody that we concern about is between your second husband and you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
 How old is your son? And how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old. My daughter is eight months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you went out, your daughter lived with you or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'is she' instead of 'is'

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
 Because when I went out, my daughter was only 2 months, she needed me and she lived with me.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'lived' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'lived with me' instead of 'she lived with me'.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
 Now, the child lives with whom?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now, my daughter lives with my husband.
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'Now, my daughter lives with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you have any agreement? Why your daughter lived with you first, and now she lives with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '協議' as 'agreement' instead of 'arrangement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'lived' before the subject 'your daughter' in the second sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '原來' which means 'originally' in the first sentence.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
  The place that I live now is not big so my child lives with my husband. For environmental concern, my daughter lives with my husband now.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '比較小' as 'not big' instead of 'small'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'my child lives' instead of 'I gave my child to'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the husband's house being bigger.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the better environment for the child.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the decision being made by the speaker.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
Just for the objective circumstances, the situation for your daughter is not good, right? Why would you have the custody of your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my child, how could I live without her? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian, and he might go back to Canada any time. If that’s a case, I cannot meet my daughter anymore. So, I want to have the custody.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the child was carried for ten months before being born.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'is' instead of 'was' to indicate past tense in 'She is my child'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭取女兒的撫養權' as 'want to have the custody' instead of 'want to fight for custody of the daughter'.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your financial status, can you explain more that how would you rear your child?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'daughter' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'rear' before the subject 'you' instead of after.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are in divorce case now. I hope, after the case, I can live in the house that my husband lives now. The house is good for my daughter to grow up. For my financial status, I just turned in my asset list for the court. Furthermore, I have a job, and the income is NT40000 each month. I think I can be capable of rearing my child.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I hope, after the case, I can live in the house that my husband lives now.' The correct word order should be 'I hope I can live in the house that my husband lives in, after the case.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'The house is good for my daughter to grow up.' The correct form should be 'The house is good for my daughter to grow up in.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'For my financial status, I just turned in my asset list for the court.' The correct tense should be 'For my financial status, I have just turned in my asset list for the court.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after the introductory phrase 'For my financial status' in the sentence 'For my financial status I just turned in my asset list for the court.' The correct form should be 'For my financial status, I just turned in my asset list for the court.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How’s your divorce case now? When will the sentence out?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case going now?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of any scheduled judgment or approximate timing.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. This Friday, we will go to the court again. I want to tell the judge who charges our divorce case that I hope the sentence out fast.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok, so, the court will arrange the social workers to visit both parties. And the social workers will evaluate the situation. After the court sees the report, we will think who is better for the child. But before that, do both parties want to share the custody? The term of shared custody means that sometimes the child lives with father and sometimes lives with mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'But before that, do both parties want to share the custody?' is incorrect. It should be 'But before that, do both parties want to share custody?'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
 就目前來說，我並不想這麼打算，因為我的小孩還太小。她只有八個月大，我不希望她一直在我和我老婆之間來來回回。對於這麼小的小孩來說，對於她一下要來這邊一下要去那邊，會讓她感到困擾。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不希望她一直在我和我老婆之間來來回回。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '一下要來這邊一下要去那邊' is not an accurate translation of 'the changes between me and my wife'. It does not convey the idea of alternating between parents.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the child has to stay with one parent for some time and another parent for another period of time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '對於這麼小的小孩來說，對於她一下要來這邊一下要去那邊，會讓她感到困擾。'

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
For this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small, and it’s not suitable for shared custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'daughter'.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
We will arrange social workers’ visitation first. After they finish the report, we will set the next court date. Both parties will have chance to state, is that ok?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'We will first arrange social workers' visitation.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the social workers' visitation is part of the process before setting the court date.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After they finish the report, we will set the next court date.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that both parties will have the opportunity to state their opinions during the court proceedings.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
是的，我對於社工參訪沒有意見。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
Yes.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？

Please state more detailedly about this point. I know your case are also under the divorce judge, therefore, I want both of you to avoid the verbal attack situation.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I want to ask some question of the defendant. Would you please state why you want the custody of your child? As I know, you do not have a full-time job in Taiwan, and you are a foreigner, in the case of child rearing, why do think you are more better then the other?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望你能夠把女兒全部的撫養權都判給我。第一點是：我的妻子沒有和我住在一起了。我希望看著我的孩子成長。此外，我也聽說我的妻子現在正和其他男人住在一起。如果這是事實的話，那我會懷疑我的妻子是否能給我們的女兒最好的照顧。因此這就是我希望有全部撫養權的原因。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我希望你能夠把女兒全部的撫養權都判給我'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Incorrect translation of 'sole custody' as '全部的撫養權都判給我'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for wanting sole custody: 'because of two concerns'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'the best care she deserves'

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
 Do you mean you and your wife are having the divorce trial, and she does not live with you, and you also suspect that she is living with another man, so because of the two reasons you do not want to let your wife have the custody, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'you and your wife are having the divorce trial' instead of 'you are having the divorce trial with your wife'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'you do not want to let your wife have the custody' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The correct translation should be 'you do not want to give custody of your children to her'.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
沒錯，那是我主要的考量。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Besides, at the point of the financial status, if you have the sole custody of your daughter, what would you do?

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有全職的工作是個事實。但是我有幾份固定的收入，能夠幫助我們生活。我相信這幾份收入可以讓我和我女兒過生活。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在沒有全職的工作是個事實。' instead of '我現在沒有全職的工作是個事實。'

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned before that you have several part-time jobs, because those are part-time jobs, can you guarantee that you will have a fixed income?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of estimating the monthly fixed income.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平常有4～5份的兼職工作。總收入來說，它可以帶給我一萬五。如果我有其他的…額外工作的話，會帶我更多的收入。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'NT$50,000' as '一萬五', which means '15,000' instead of '50,000'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '的兼職工作' before the number '4～5份', which is the opposite of the original word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the unit 'NT$' when translating the amount of income.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
The next question is if you have your daughter’s custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and do not come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask is when you have the custody, but your wife also have the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, it will cut your daughter’s  ties with your wife. What’s your opinion about this point?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the father not returning to Taiwan.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'will' instead of 'would' to express a hypothetical situation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '隔離' as 'cut ties' instead of 'separate' or 'isolate'.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經待在台灣5年了。我有居留證，我也喜歡台灣。目前我並沒有離開台灣的打算，特別我認為，我的小孩有權…應該要有機會能夠看到父母。我想要強調的是，雖然我和我的妻子正打算離婚，但是我並沒有打算切斷他們母女的關係。就算我們在打離婚官司的期間，我也會定期寄照片給我的妻子。我甚至安排家庭聚會的時間，讓她和我們的女兒跟我一起見面，培養感情。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我認為，我的小孩有權…應該要有機會能夠看到父母'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '我想要強調的是，雖然我和我的妻子正打算離婚，但是我並沒有打算切斷他們母女的關係'

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'us' in the sentence: '我甚至安排家庭聚會的時間，讓她和我們的女兒跟我一起見面，培養感情'

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
Currently, you do not have the plan to go back, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不，我可能會回去，但這是因為我母親年事已高又已經生病了。但是即使我回去，我也不會待在那裏很久。更不會想要把女兒帶過去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '但這是因為我母親年事已高又已經生病了' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但這是因為我母親已經年事已高又生病了'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense in the sentence '但是即使我回去，我也不會待在那裏很久' is incorrect. The correct verb tense should be '但是即使我回去，我也不會在那裏待很久'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word '考慮' in the sentence '更不會想要把女兒帶過去'. The correct translation should be '更不會考慮想要把女兒帶過去'.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now, I am going to ask the other part some questions. Don’t you live with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'separated' should agree with the plural subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When do you …the case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
Before you have the divorce trial, you have already not live with your husband, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
Then, who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
 I live with my son which from my first marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I live' instead of 'I lives'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? Then, which is this marriage you with the plaintiff?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
Now，you are fighting the custody with your second husband and this child is a daughter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'fighting the custody' instead of 'fighting for custody'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'second husband' instead of 'second ex-husband' to accurately convey the relationship.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'Now' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'So'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the child being the biological child of the speaker and the second ex-husband.

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
Then how old is you son? And how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight-month …year old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	mismatch between singular subject 'daughter' and plural verb 'are'
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the word 'years' after 'eight-month'

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, does your daughter live with you or with your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'does' should be changed to 'did' to match the past tense of 'moved out'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because when I moved out, my daughter was just two- month old, she needed my care , so she was with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter was with the speaker.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
And now, who does your daughter live with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter live with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you have some agreements with your husband? Why does your daughter fist live with you, but with your husband later?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why does your daughter first live with you, but with your husband later?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The house I moved into is smaller than the house I lived with my husband. So take the environment into consideration, I think our previous house is better for my daughter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '對孩子比較優' as 'better for my daughter' instead of 'better for the children'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So, in the objective circumstance, which means the living environmental, if the house is the same as yours, you will live with your daughter, is that right? So why do you want to have the custody of your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I spend ten months bearing…to…, how could I live without her. And my husband is a Canadian, and he does not have regular income, he might have the possibility to go back to Canada any time. If that happens, I would not see my daughter anymore, that’s the reason why I wan to my daughter’s custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'I wan to my daughter’s custody'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'spend ten months bearing' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'live without her' in the translation

omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'that’s the reason why' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'I would not see my daughter anymore' in the translation

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Please describe detailedly about how will you raise your child, concider your financial status.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we are having the divorce case. I want to ask the court to sentence the house, which I lived with my husband before for me. So thinking about the environment, the house is a good place for my children to grow up. As for my financial status, I have already provided my own asset list to the court; otherwise, I also have a regular income, which is probably 40000(forty thousand) a month. I think I have the capability of taking good care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I want to ask the court to sentence the house'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'sentence' is not appropriate in this context. It should be 'grant' or 'award'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the house is currently occupied by the husband.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be 'are' to agree with the plural subject 'my children'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter is the subject of the sentence and should be mentioned earlier.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'lived' should be 'live' to match the present tense of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter is the subject of the sentence and should be mentioned earlier.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce trial? Do you know when do the divorce case end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce trial?' instead of 'How is your divorce trial?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the question about the timing of the judgment.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure, we will have the court on this Friday. I will say to the judge of our divorce case that I wan to end the case as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, the court will send social worker to visit both of your houses, and evaluate how is your daughter’s relation with each of you. The court will take those two factors into consider, and consider who will give the daughter the best …condition. Before we give the custody, do you have the willingness to have shared custody? The shared custody means the child live with the parent …live with the father for a while, and live with the mother for a while.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'The shared custody means the child live with the parent …live with the father for a while, and live with the mother for a while.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the social worker visiting both parties' houses and evaluating the child's relationship with each parent.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the court considering the social worker's report in making a decision.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the mention of the court making arrangements based on what is best for the child.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the question of whether both parties would consider shared custody.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
就我個人的意見的話，我不贊同共同撫養，因為我的女兒還太小，她只有八個月大。我不想她不能適應我跟妻子之間的變動。對一個這麼小的小孩來說，跟父親或母親只住在一起一段時間會造成她的混淆。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
In this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small, she is not …the shared custody is not good for her.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'she is' instead of 'she is not'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of why shared custody is not good for the daughter.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So, we just arrange the social worker first. After they have their reports, we will set another court date. At that time, both of you will have the chances to state your opinions.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After they have their reports, we will set another court date.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of arranging the social worker first before setting another court date.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我對社工探訪的這件事沒意見
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I do not have problems, thank you.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today I want to understand the stances of both parties for child rearing. And the other question I want to know is that why both parties think that he or she is best for the child rearing. And according to this question, I want you both can elaborate in detail. Because I know you are in the divorce case. And I don’t want you both make the verbal attack to each other.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
At first I want to ask the plaintiff. Why do you want to fight for the child rearing right? According to the file, you don’t have the regular job in Taiwan, and you are the foreigner. Why do you think are more appropriate for the child rearing right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's current job status and nationality.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我認為應該要將全部的撫養權判都給我,因為我真的非常關心他,我有兩個原因,第一是因為我的妻子根本沒有跟我們住在一起,我想跟我的女兒一起長大,而且我聽說我的前妻現在跟別的男人同居,如果事實真的是這樣的話,我很懷疑他是否能夠給我女兒一個很好的成長環境,因此我希望我能擁有全部的撫養權
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	撫養權判都給我 (grant all custody to me) should be translated as 應該要將全部的撫養權判給我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	我真的非常關心他 (I really care about him) should be translated as 我真的非常關心她 (I really care about her)
semantic conversion	omission of details	我有兩個原因 (I have two reasons) should be translated as 我有兩個原因 (I have two reasons)

semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	撫養權 (custody) should be translated as 撫養權 (custody)

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that your although you ex-wife is in divorce case with you but she live with another man. Moreover, you doubted that she is live with other man. Do you concern she’s situation, so you don’t the child rearing to granted to you wife?

Yes, those are my main concerns.
事的,這就是我所關心的
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '事的' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'concerns'.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
 According to you financial status, what will you going to do if you get the child rearing right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我知道我現在目前是沒有固定的收入,但是我有幾分兼職的工作可以讓我收入很穩定,我相信那些收入對我和我女兒來說是非常足夠的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mention that you have several part time job. Because they are part time job, can you promise you have the regular income?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均都有四到五份的兼職工作,平均來說我一個月都可以領四萬台幣左右,如果我有更好的工作阿或計畫的話我會有更多的收入
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
The other question I want to ask you is if you get the child rearing right, would you bring you daughter to Canada and would not come back Taiwan? I want to ask this question is even if you get the child rearing right, you wife still have the visitation right. If you bring you daughter to your country, on other hand to say that you are separated them. For this case, do you have any explanation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經住在台灣五年了,我有居留證,而且我也很喜歡這個地方,到目前為止我並沒有要離開台灣的打算,而且我想我的女兒有權力去見他的雙方父母,我必須強調的是,雖然我現在跟我的現任妻子正在打離婚官司,但是並不是說我要切斷他們所有的連繫,在我和我老婆打離婚官司這個期間,我還是有固定江我女兒照片發給我老婆看,我甚至鼓勵我老婆可以常常和我女兒就是可以出門走走希望增進感情

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean that you don’t have plan to back your country.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
也不是完全不可能,因為我的母親正在生病,不過就算我回去也不會待很久,因為我想要將我女兒……….
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of not considering the possibility of taking the daughter.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I want to ask the other party some questions. Do you separate with your husband now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we are separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'are' should agree with the plural subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
It’s to say before you file the divorce case, you both were not living together, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
And what’s your living circumstance? I mean who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son of first marriage.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So the marriage with the ………..
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the person the speaker is married to.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'he', so it should be 'He is' instead of 'He are'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the child rearing right today here you both fight for is your second husband’s daughter, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly refers to the child as the assistant's second husband's daughter, when it should be the assistant's daughter with her second husband.

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old are your son and your daughter?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'are' should agree with the plural subjects 'son' and 'daughter'.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son id 7 years old and my daughter is 8 months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter' in number.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you live outer, did your daughter live with you or your husband?

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because when I went out, my daughter still 2 months old, so she has to live with me.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is with my husband.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Did you have any agreement because your daughter is lived with you but now is live with your husband?

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
The objective circumstance, I mean the living environment does not change, does your daughter live with your husband is better than you. So why do you want to fight for the child rearing right?

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I have pregnant for ten moths, I can’t live without her. She is my baby. Moreover, I husband is Canadian, he is probably go back to Canada anytime, in that case, I can’t see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I want to right for my daughter’s custody.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
According to your financial status, can you explain what will you going to do to care with your daughter?

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we are in divorce case, I want to fight for the living right in currently my husband lived house. According to the environment that house is the vest choice for my daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce case? When is the decision comes out? Or the precise time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case?' instead of 'How is your case divorce?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the part asking about the expected time of the decision.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. This Friday we have to go to the court again. I want to state to the court that I want the decision comes out quickly.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok I will arrange the social workers to both parties’ house. And they will make the evaluation of the living situation of you both with your daughter. The court will make the decision concerning the social workers’ evaluation. But before that circumstance, I want ask you both, do you consider the shared custody. It means the living time will change from time to time with you both. Rather. It means the daughter will live with the husband some time and other time will live with the wife.

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence: 'But before that circumstance, I want ask you both...' It should be 'But before that, I want to ask both of you...'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
目前我並沒有這個打算,因為我覺得我女兒還太小了,她只有八個月大,我不想它異質精力這種在父母親之間的改變,對這麼小的小孩來說它是沒有辦法適應必須一下子跟這個至親在一起一下子跟那個親人在一起
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我并没有这个打算' instead of '目前我并没有这个打算'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '異質精力' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'changes between me and my wife'. It should be translated as '在父母之间的变化' instead.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the mention of the confusion it may cause for the child.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
Upon this point, I have the same idea with mu husband. My daughter is too young to suit the shared custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out critical context

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Ok, so at first I will arrange the social workers‘ visitation. After their report comes out, I will arrange the other court. And in this court, you both have the time to explain.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
So first I want to ask the plaintiff a few questions. Please tell me why do you want the sole custody of your children? As my un…for my understanding, you don’t have a… you don’t have a full time job or regular income I n Taiwan. Also, you are a fore…fore…foreigner. So, in this case, why you think you are more suitable for this… for the children…for the child rearing?

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望擁有我兩個女兒的全部扶養權，有兩個原因。首先，我太太已經不和我們一起住了。我希望能看著我女兒成長。恩…再者，我聽說我太太目前正在和別的男人同居。如果真的是這樣子的話，我很懷疑她是不是能夠讓我小孩擁有…得到應有的照顧。這就是為什麼我希望可以擁有全部扶養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我希望擁有我兩個女兒的全部扶養權' (I hope to have the sole custody of my two daughters). The correct word order should be '我希望擁有全部扶養權的我兩個女兒'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我女兒成長' (see my daughter grow up) is translated as '我希望能看著我女兒成長' (I hope to be able to see my daughter grow up), which changes the meaning slightly.

semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The phrase '我太太' (my wife) is translated as '我太太' (my wife), which is not culturally appropriate in English. The correct translation should be 'my wife'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean…um…even you and your wife are still in the case…in the divorce, that she’s no longer live with you? And you also doubt that she lives with the other…another man? So base on such situation, so you are not willing to give your child…your daughter to her. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'even you and your wife are still in the case…in the divorce'

semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the phrase 'to her' in the sentence 'So base on such situation, so you are not willing to give your child…your daughter'

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，就是這樣。這是我最主要的考量。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Otherwise, to consider your… in the consideration of your financial status, if you do have the sole custody, so how do you going to raise your child…your daughters?

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實是沒有全職的工作。但是我目前有幾份的打工，讓我有固定的收入。我相信這些收入足夠扶養我自己和我的女兒們。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在確實沒有全職的工作。'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. The correct verb form should be '沒有' instead of '是沒有'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '女兒們' is used in the translation, which means 'daughters', but the original text only mentions 'my daughter', indicating a singular form.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
So you just mention that you have several part-time jobs. So because they are part-times, can you give the basic…basic estivation… estitation that you can… how much money you can have each month?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有四到五份兼職。所以平均每個月可以有…一萬五的收入。如果有其他的工作的的話，會有更多的收入。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'NT$50,000' as '一萬五' is incorrect. It should be translated as '五萬台幣' to accurately represent the amount.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
So my another concern is that err if you have… if you have the custody, will you bring the daughters back to Canada and never come back? And why I ask this question is that even if you have the custody, your wife still might have the visitation right. So if you bring your daughters back to your country, then… in another way, it’s a kind way… it’s a kind of way of… cut the tie with your…cut the tie between your wife and daughters. So on this point, what’s your appoint…opinion?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omits the mention of 'daughters' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user uses 'will' instead of 'would' in the conditional sentence, resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待五年了，我有居留證，而且我喜歡這個地方，所以目前並沒有離開台灣的打算。尤其我覺得我的女兒有權利見到他的父親和母親。我想強調的是，雖然我和我太太正在打離婚官司，但我絕對並沒有想要把他們連結切斷的意思………並沒有把我太太和小孩的連結切斷的意思。即使在我們打官司的過程中，我還是會固定傳我女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至還安排了一些時間就是讓她…來和我們女兒一起團聚。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '尤其我覺得我的女兒有權利見到他的父親和母親' is incorrect. It should be '尤其我覺得我的女兒有權利見到她的父親和母親'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean you don’t…in recently… recently, you don’t have the plan to go back to your country, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
恩…並不是，因為我可能會回去加拿大。因為我母親已經老了，而且她還生病。但即使我回去加拿大，我也不會待非常久的時間。我甚至可能不會考慮帶我女兒一起回去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我甚至可能不會考慮帶我女兒一起回去' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我甚至可能不會考慮帶我女兒回去一起。'

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
OK now so I’m going to ask Ms…Ms. Shi few question. So you’re no longer lives with your husband, is that right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'lives' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'you no longer live' instead of 'you no longer lives'.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we are de…we are separated for six months.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
Um… can you… when you…when you… when you… right, when you ask for the divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Around two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So is that mean, long before you… before you file the case, you’re no longer live together?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So can you tell me your… now your live situation? I mean… who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I’m live with the… I’m live with my son from my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? So this is… this is which marriage do you have with our plaintiff?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He’s my second husband. He WAS my second husband.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'was' should be used instead of 'is' to indicate past tense.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So now the child rearing right we are arguing about is your… is with your second husband and your second daughters?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

對。
Yep.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughters?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughters?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is only eight month years old…eight-month old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'eight-month old' instead of 'eight month years old'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, um the daughter is with you or with the husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'is she' instead of 'is with you'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because when I moved out, my… our daughter is only two-month old so she is with me… she was with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the possessive pronoun 'our' before 'daughter', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the present tense 'is' instead of the past tense 'was' to match the past tense of 'moved out'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user changed the meaning of '孩子跟我' from 'the child is with me' to 'she was with me'.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So now where the… who now does the child live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
So far, the daughter live with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'My daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there some kind of agreement between you two? Why the… why the first the daughter live with you, and now she lives with your husband?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the phrase 'why the first the daughter live with you'.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I move out, the new house is a little bit smaller than the house we had. So our original house is… I think is better than the house I live for now, so I give the daughter to mu husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'So our original house is… I think is better than the house I live for now'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I give the daughter to my husband' should be 'I entrusted our daughter to my husband' to accurately convey the meaning.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So if the objective circumstances, I mean the place you live, is nothing change, is there… is um… is not a very good place for your daughter, isn’t it? So why do you want to… why do you want the custody of your daughter?

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I mean com’n, she’s… she’s the daughter I bear for ten months, so how can I live with… no longer… errr no chance to see her after all…um after all this? And besides, my husband is a Canadian, and part…and the time… and he doesn’t have a regular part in Taiwan. Moreover, he… he might go back to Canada at any times! So in that case, if he went back… if he go back to Canada, is… I might no longer… I might no longer have the chance to see my daughters. So that’s why I want to argue for our… my daughter’s sole custody.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	com'n instead of how can I live with

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Base on your financial status, can you elaborate how you’re going to raise your daughter?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'financial' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'financial' and 'status' in the translation.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far, we’re still seeking the divorce case. So I to fight for the right to live with the house my husband is live with…is live in. So base on that environment, I think the house will be a… will be a right place… will be a good place for raising my child. And my… talking about my financial status, I’ve already offer the court one of my asset list. Otherwise, I have a regular job, so my total income each month is average forty thousands.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
May I ask your… your divorce case is in what progress? Is in what process? Is there any… any date that you are… you can expect that the judgment will… will come out?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. We have go to the court this Friday. I want ask the judge on Friday… um our judgment will come out as soon as possible.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, now, the court will arrange the social… a social worker to pay a visit to the plaintiff and the… to the husband and wife. And will make a evaluation about your… about your dealing…about your dealing situation between the father…between…um… between the parents and the children. And the court will make the judgment based on their evaluations and find out… find out what is the best situation for the children. Before that I have to ask, is shared-custody in your consideration?

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不喜歡這樣的安排，因為我女兒還太小了。她才八個月大欸。我不想要她在我和我太太之間不斷來回。對於這麼小的孩子來說，這未免也太混亂了吧，要和其中…其中…要和雙親其中一方待一陣子，然後有和另外一方待一陣子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	misplacement of words
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect interpretation of 'stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time'

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this point, I agree with my husband. My… our daughter is still too young for… is too young… for this solution.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'My... our daughter is still too young for... is too young... for this solution.'

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So in this case, so we might…err…so we are… so for now, we are going to into the procedure for the social worker’s evaluation. After evaluation came…come out, then we will arrange another court. Let the both side have the chance to their statements. Is that ok with you?

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today, in the preparation procedure, I would like to you… to know your position in the child rearing case and also I would like to know why you …both of you claim you are the appropriate person to rear the child.   Please elaborate this point. Besides, I know that you are also in the divorce case. So I don’t want to see verbal attack which you made on the other person.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I will inquire the plaintiff. Plaintiff, why do you want the custody to be granted to you? As I known, you don’t have a full time job in Taiwan, and also you are a foreigner. So why do you think you are …more capable?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我想要爭取小孩的監護權有個原因:第一我太太不再在跟我住，我想要看我小孩長大，而且我聽聞我太太跟一個男人同居，如果這是真的話，我懷疑她能給我女兒她應得的照顧，因此我希望擁有我女兒的扶養權
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我想要爭取小孩的監護權有個原因' should be '我有個原因想要爭取小孩的監護權'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that you.. and your wife are still in the divorce case but she no longer live with you and also doubted her of living with another man. Is this the reason that you refuse… refuse to give the daughter … be taking care of.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits important details from the original text.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對這是我主要的考慮
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
As for your financial status, if you are granted for the sole custody, how are you going to take care of her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How are you going to take care of her if you are granted sole custody?'

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有全職的工作是真的，但是我有幾份兼差，有穩定收入，我相信這幾筆收入能足夠讓我照顧我自己跟女兒
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of having a regular income from the part-time jobs.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have a few part jobs. Because that are just part-time jobs. Can you … can you approximately count what income could you have each month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有4到5個兼差，總共來說一個會有5萬多，有時候或許我有新案子，收入會更多
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another question I would like to ask, if you are granted with the custody of your daughter. Will you back to Canada and you won’t come back? The reason I am asking this question is …. Even though you are granted with the custody of your daughter, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to your country, it will …. It will cut the lie.. between the daughter and mom. As for this point, what do you have to say?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'It will cut the lie.. between the daughter and mom' is incorrect. It should be 'It will cut the tie between the daughter and mom.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'cut the lie' does not convey the intended meaning. It should be 'cut the tie' to indicate the potential disruption of the relationship between the daughter and her mother.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text, such as the mention of custody and visitation rights.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation lacks appropriate formality and politeness. It is important to use respectful language when discussing sensitive topics like custody and visitation rights.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年，我有居留證，我也喜歡台灣，目前我沒有計畫離開台灣，而且我相信我女兒應該要有機會看到爸爸媽媽，我想強調的是雖然我和我太太目前正在打離婚官司但我並沒有想要切斷女兒和媽媽的聯繫，在我們整個離婚官司的時候，我不時會傳些我女兒的照片給我太太，甚至還安排ㄧ些外出讓她能跟我們一起度過ㄧ些時光
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我女兒應該要有機會看到爸爸媽媽' is incorrect. It should be '我女兒應該要有機會看到爸爸和媽媽'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '打離婚官司' should agree with the subject '我和我太太', so it should be '我和我太太正在打離婚官司'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '待了五年' should be in the present perfect tense to match the English sentence, so it should be '我已經在台灣待了五年了'.
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	The phrase '我女兒' should have an article/determiner before it, so it should be '我的女兒'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我女兒應該要有機會看到爸爸媽媽' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents'. It should be '我女兒應該要有機會看到她的爸爸和媽媽'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user having an ARC (Alien Resident Certificate) in Taiwan.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean …. Recently you don’t have a plan to go back to your country, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不 我可能會回加拿大，因為我母親年紀大了又生病，但如果我回去的話，我也不會待很久，我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒回去
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "不 我可能會回加拿大" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我可能不會回加拿大".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense in the sentence "我也不會考慮帶我女兒回去" is incorrect. The correct verb tense should be "我也不會考慮帶我女兒回去".

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I am going to ask some questions of the other party. Do you …. You don’t live t with your husband, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes we have been separated for 6 months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Around 2 months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is necessary for clarity.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
You mean before file the divorce case, you had not live with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So can you tell me who you are living with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
 I am now living with my son which from the first marriage
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So what is the marriage you and the plaintiff?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the custody we are going to .. you are going to ask for is the child you had with your second husband? And she is a girl?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對。
yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? How old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is 7 years old and my daughter is 8 months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you move out, the daughter goes with you or stays with your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'goes' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'does the daughter go' instead of 'goes the daughter'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because when the time I move out, my daughter was only 2 months, she is so little and she needs me, so I brought he
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter is still in need of the user's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So who lives with the child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter lives with my husband
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you and the plaintiff have found an agreement? Why the daughter was with you but now she lives with your husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '中間有什麼協議嗎' as 'Do you and the plaintiff have found an agreement?' instead of 'What agreement do you have?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '原來女兒跟你，現在跟他' as 'Why the daughter was with you but now she lives with your husband.' instead of 'Why was the daughter with you before, but now she is with him?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
 The place I moved out was little.. Littler than the house my husband was living.. for the environmental concern I give my daughter to my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The place I moved out of was smaller than the house my husband was living in.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'little' should be 'smaller' to accurately convey the comparison between the two places.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the new place is smaller than the previous one.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation also omits the information that the new place is better for the child.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the reason for giving the child to the husband, which is the better environment.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstance did not change, your living environment is not good for your daughter, right? Why do you want to ask for the custody of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you want to ask for custody of your daughter?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. The original text does not mention anything about asking for custody, it only states that the living environment is not good for the daughter.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter who I spent ten months in pregnant. How could I bear not to see her? My husband is from husband Canada and his job in Taiwan is not stable. He may go back to Canada anytime, if that is the case, I could not see my daughter anymore, therefore I would like to as for the custody for my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'spent ten months in pregnant'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in 'husband Canada'
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect tense in 'he may go back to Canada anytime'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'I hope to' in 'I would like to as for the custody for my daughter'

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your financial status, could you tell how are you going to raise your child?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'explain' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'tell' before the subject 'you', which is incorrect in English.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are now still in the divorce case. I hope to ask for the hose which my husband lives now. So … as the surroundings around for the house, it will be good for my daughter. As for my financial status, I had already shown an asset list to the court. Besides, I also have a stable job; the payment which I could get every month is above 40000 Dollars. I think I am capable in both ways to raise my daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce going? Do know when the court’s decision will be made or …
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you know' instead of 'Do know'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the court in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the possibility of a scheduled judgment in the original text.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. This Friday we will be on the court again for the divorce case. I would tell the judge that I would like to know the court’s decision for the divorce as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok.. So.. The court will arrange social workers to visit both of your houses. And also the social workers will make the evaluation of the situation you and the plaintiff have with your child. The court will take the results into consideration and consider what is best for the child. Before that, I would like to ask both of you, do you like to have shared custody. The shared custody I mean here is the daughter will spend some time with the father and some time with the mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The court will take the results into consideration and consider what is best for the child.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the social workers visiting both houses in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the evaluation of the situation between the parents and the child in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court considering the social workers' report in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court making arrangements for the child based on the evaluation and report in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court asking if the parents would consider shared custody in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the explanation of shared custody, which is the child spending time with both parents in their translation.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不喜歡這個安排，因為我女兒還太小，她只有八個月，我不想要她一直在我和我太太間送來送去，對一個只有八個月的小孩來說，她可能會產生困惑，有些時間和爸爸在一起有些時間和媽媽
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不喜歡這個安排，因為我女兒還太小。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '送來送去' is not accurately translated. It should be translated as 'go back and forth' or 'shuttle between'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the changes between the parents. The original text mentions 'the changes between me and my wife'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about staying with one parent for some time and another parent for another period of time.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
At this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small. The arrangement should not .. could not be arranges as shared custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The arrangement should not be arranged as shared custody.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'also not suitable' from the original text.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So we will arrange the social worker to visit you houses. After they made the report, we will assign the next court day, so both of the parties will have the chance to state what you want to say. Is that ok?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the social worker visiting the houses.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the parties having the opportunity to state their opinions.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
社工人員來訪沒有問題
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I am fine with that, thank you.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today our case is the child rearing case between Ferry Johnson and Tsai-Yung Shu. Have you all… Have you both appointed lawyers?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我有委託律師。
Yes, I have.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有…一名律師。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'lawyer' in the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today for our preparatory case, my main goal today is to understand your main positions in the case. I would also like to know the reason why both of you believe you are more fitting to take care of the child. Could you please emphasize your views on this later on. Besides, I am also aware that you are in the court for divorce at the moment. So I would not like to hear any verbal attack between the two parties, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Could you please emphasize your views on this later on' is incorrect. It should be 'Could you please emphasize your views on this later?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence 'So I would not like to hear any verbal attack between the two parties, do you understand?'.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Ok, first I would like to ask: Why do you want… the right to take care of your child. As far as I know, you do not have an official job in Taipei. You are also a foreigner. Why do you believe you are a more suitable person for custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you want the right to take care of your child?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭取孩子的撫養權' as 'the right to take care of your child' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'custody'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the person not having a full-time job in Taiwan and being a foreigner, which are important details in the context of the question.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望擁有我女兒的全部扶養權，因為兩個原因。首先，我老婆並沒有汗我住在一起。我想要看著我的女兒長大。另外我還有聽到我的老婆漢另外一個男人同住。如果這屬實，我深切地懷疑她是否適合照顧我們的女兒，於是我希望取得全部扶養權。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	汗 instead of和
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the reason for doubting the wife's ability to care for the daughter

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
What you mean is…while your wife has filed a divorce case with you, she is not living with you at the moment. And you have doubts about whether she is living with another man. And therefore, you are not willing to let your wife take care of your children, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這是我主要的顧慮。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Next is about your financial status, and that means, if you receive custody of your child, how will you deal with the money?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我的確沒有一個全職的工作，但我有幾個兼職的工作，所以…我是有收入的。我認為這些收入是夠照顧我自己與女兒的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned you have many part time jobs. Because they are not fixed, can you estimate your fixed income for each month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Can you estimate your fixed income for each month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有四到五個…五份兼任的工作。加起來的話，大概會有一個月一萬五的收入。通常，如果我有新的專案的話，我就會有更多收入。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我平均有四到五個兼任的工作。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'NT$50,000' as '一個月一萬五' is incorrect. It should be translated as '五萬台幣'.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Next, I would like to ask you: If you received custody of your child, is it possible that you will bring your child to Canada, and never come back? My reason for asking this is even though you receive custody, your wife still has a visitation right. If you bring your child back to your country, it will equal…your preventing your wife from seeing the child. What do you have to say about this?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the possibility of not returning to the country after bringing the child to Canada.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了，我有居留證我也喜歡這個地方。至今我還沒有任核計劃要離開。尤其是我覺得…我女兒應該有見到她父母的權利。我想要強調的是：即使我和我老婆正在進行離婚程序，但我並不想要阻絕我老婆和我女兒…相見的機會。我們在辦離婚手續的這段期間，我都會固定送女兒的照片給老婆看。我也會計劃一些戶外的活動…讓女兒和老婆見面。

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omitting important details in the sentence: '我已經在台灣待了五年了' should be '我已經在台灣待了五年'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean in the short term, you have no plans to go back to your country.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不是，我可能會回到加拿大，因為我媽媽年紀大了，也生病了。但即便我回去，也不會待太久。我甚至完全不會考慮將我女兒一起帶回去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '不是，我可能會回到加拿大' is incorrect. It should be '我可能會回到加拿大，不是'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb '回去' should be consistent with the tense of the verb '回到'. It should be '回到' instead of '回去'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the mother being sick in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not considering taking the daughter with them in the translation.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
OK, now I’d like to ask the other party. So, you are not living with your husband anymore?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'So, are you not living with your husband anymore?'

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we’ve been separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the plural subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case for divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So you’ve been separated even before you filed a lawsuit for divorce.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So may I ask your living situation? What I mean is, who are you living with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I’m living with my son from my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? So, the marriage between you and the….defendant…which…
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '告訴人' as 'defendant' instead of 'informant'.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the custody that you both are seeking…. is for your second child, your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? And how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, did your daughter stay with the father or with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did your daughter stay with you or with the father?'

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out, the child was only six months old and needed me to take care of her, so she went with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the child was only 2 months old, not six months old.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
And who is the child with at this moment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'With whom is the child at this moment?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now the child is with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The correct word order should be 'Now my daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Have you reached any sort of agreement? Why was the daughter with you at the first point, and now with… the husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '中間有什麼協議' as 'reached any sort of agreement', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase 'the daughter with you at the first point'. It should be 'the daughter was with you at the first point'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '原來' which means 'originally' in the phrase 'Why was the daughter with you at the first point'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '女兒' which means 'daughter' in the phrase 'Why was the daughter with you at the first point'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '現在' which means 'now' in the phrase 'and now with… the husband'.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
My accommodation when I moved out is smaller than before. Considering the environment…the living environment, the old house was better, so I sent my daughter back.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So if the objective circumstances, or the living environment has changed, it’s not good for your daughter either, isn’t it? Then why would you want to fight for your child’s custody?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I bore her for ten months! How could I even consider leaving her? Besides, my husband is a Canadian citizen. He doesn’t even have a stable job. If so, I might never see my daughter again. So I wish to… to receive custody for my child.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of giving birth in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'receive' instead of 'fight for' in the translation.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Concerning your financial status, can you elaborate…more about how you will take care of your daughter?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about financial ability in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'Concerning your financial status' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'Can you elaborate'.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are still in the middle of our divorce case. I wish to receive the house that my husband is living in right now. That would be a better environment for my daughter to grow up in. And about my financial status, I provided the court with my asset list. I also have a fixed job. I earn 40 thousand dollars each month. Or more. I think I’m capable of taking care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'That would be a better environment for my daughter to grow up in.' It should be 'That would be a better environment for my daughter to grow up in.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I earn 40 thousand dollars each month.' It should be 'I earn 40 thousand dollars each month.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'I think I’m capable of taking care of my daughter.' It should be 'I think I am capable of taking care of my daughter.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce case going? Have you estimated what time the courts decision will come out?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. We will come to court again this Friday. I wish to tell the judge of the divorce case that I would like to see the results of the divorce case come out sooner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
How about this, the court will send a social worker to visit both parties. Then they will evaluate the situation of both parties to see if they are fit to take care of the child. The report will be considered by the court to make the decision. But prior to that, I would like to ask if you consider…a shared custody? Shared custody entails that the child for a period of time stays with the father, and another period stays with the mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'How about this' is incorrect. It should be 'How about this?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'fit to take care of the child' is not an accurate translation of '針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估'. It should be 'evaluate the interaction between you and the child'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the social worker visiting both parties. This is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the court considering the social worker's report. This is a critical detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the question about shared custody, which is a significant part of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the explanation of shared custody being the child staying with the father for a period of time and with the mother for another period of time.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人比較不偏好這個選擇，因為我的女兒年紀還太小。她只有八個月大。不希望她承受…這樣子的變化。對一個年紀這麼小的孩子來說，她會感到太困惑了，如果她有一段時間與一個人同住，然後另一段時間又搬去另一個地方。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young. It is not suitable to…for shared custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
OK, after that, let’s consider the social worker…visit. After they have devised a report, we will plan a date to come to court to give both of you an opportunity to elaborate on your decisions.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'consider the visit of the social worker'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'of' after 'visit', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'to' after 'come', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'the' before 'court', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'the' before 'opportunity', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'to' before 'elaborate', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'your' before 'decisions', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好，沒問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no problem with the decision either, thank you.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today, we’re here for the preparatory procedure between Madam Shih Tsai Yun and Ferry Johnson. Have both of you asked for a lawyer?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

我有委託律師。
Yes, I have asked a lawyer to help me.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有請。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'lawyer' from the original text.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today, the judge here wants to know more about the perspective of each party about child rearing. The judge also wants to know why both of you consider yourselves the most appropriate one to rear this child, so please elaborate this point, do you understand? In addition, I know that both of you are trying to get a divorce. Therefore, I do not wish to see that both of you have a verbal attack against each other. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Today, the judge here wants to know more about the perspective of each party about child rearing' is incorrect. It should be 'Today, the judge here wants to know more about each party's perspective on child rearing.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The judge also wants to know why both of you consider yourselves the most appropriate one to rear this child, so please elaborate this point, do you understand?' is incorrect. It should be 'The judge also wants to know why both of you consider yourselves the most appropriate ones to rear this child, so please elaborate on this point, do you understand?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Therefore, I do not wish to see that both of you have a verbal attack against each other' is incorrect. It should be 'Therefore, I do not wish to see both of you have a verbal attack against each other.'

I understand.
好，是的。

了解。
Okay.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Okay now, I have some questions to ask the plaintiff. Please tell me the reasons why you wish to rear your child. According the information I’ve received, you do not have a full-time job in Taiwan, and you’re a foreigner, so why do you consider yourself the most appropriate person to have child custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Please tell me the reasons why you wish to rear your child.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭取孩子的撫養權' as 'have child custody' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the plaintiff not having a full-time job and being a foreigner, which is important context for understanding the question.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
現在有兩個原因去支持為什麼我比較適任於擁有子女撫養權。首先，我已經沒有和太太住在一起了，我想看著孩子長大。而且我還聽說我的太太和別的男人住在一起了。若是這樣的話，她應該不會給予我女兒真正應得的關愛。因此，我適任得到全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我適任得到全部的撫養權' should be '我適任全部的撫養權得到'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
So do you mean that now, you’re preparing for a divorce, and your wife is no longer living with you, and you suspect her of living with another guy. Due to the situation like this, you do not wish to let her take care of the child, is that so?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是啊，這就是我主要的原因。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Okay, then if…umm..according to your financial status, and if you really do receive the sole custody, then how are you planning to take care of the child?

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實沒有全職工作。但是，我好幾個間質的工作，因此，我有固定的收入。這些收入足以養活我自己和我的女兒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You’ve just mentioned about that you have several part-time jobs. Due to they are part-time jobs in their nature, can you tell me an estimated income per month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
平均來說，我有四到五份兼職工作。總共來說，我每個月會賺進五萬台幣。若我有找到其他工作的話，我的收入會高於五萬。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another question that I would like to ask you is once you receive the child custody, is it possible that you would just take the child to Canada and never come back? The reason why I asked you this is that even of you receive the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. So if you do this, if you just take the child to Canada with you, then it means that you just cut the ties between your daughter and your wife. So, according to this problem, what would you like to say?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the father taking the child to Canada and not returning.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待了五年了吧。我有居留證號碼，而且我喜歡這個地方。目前為止，我是沒有要離開台灣的打算。而且我有認為我女兒應該要擁有見雙方父母的權利。縱使我和我太太目前正辦理離婚，但是，我不打算要切斷她們之間的關係。在我們辦理離婚手續的過程當中，我常常會將我女兒的照片給我太太看。我甚至會辦一些活動啊，或是約。。。我們大家一起出去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我在台灣已經待了五年了吧'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in sentence: '我有居留證號碼'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in sentence: '我有認為我女兒應該要擁有見雙方父母的權利'
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in sentence: '我不打算要切斷她們之間的關係'
grammar and structure	preposition errors	Preposition error in sentence: '在我們辦理離婚手續的過程當中'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in sentence: '我甚至會辦一些活動啊，或是約。。。我們大家一起出去'

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
 Okay, so you mean that currently, you do not have any plans to return to your mother country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
恩，不不不，我是有可能回加拿大，因為我母親現在生病啦。但縱使我回去加拿大，我也不會長期待在那裡。我應該也不會想要把我女兒帶那裡。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我是有可能回加拿大'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我應該也不會想要把我女兒帶那裡'

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay, now, I would like to ask the other party some questions. Are you still living with your husband or not?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Well, we’re not living together anymore for six months.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense should be present perfect ('have been') instead of present continuous ('we're').

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you ask for a divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About a month ago, I think.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '兩個月前' as 'about a month ago' instead of 'about two months ago'.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
Okay, that means before you asked for a divorce, you two have not been living together, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes, that’s right.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So, who are you living with now? What’s the condition now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with the former husband’s son.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the relationship between the speaker and the son. Instead of saying 'I live with the former husband's son,' it should be 'I live with my stepson from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Oh, your former husband….first marriage? Then, how about the husband you have now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '第一任婚姻' as 'former husband' instead of 'first marriage'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question about the current husband.

他是我第二任先生。
Well, he’s my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '先生' as 'husband' instead of 'Mr.'

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
Now, we’re trying to figure out the custody is about the child you have with your second husband. She’s a daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'We're trying to figure out if the custody is about the child you have with your second husband. Is she a daughter?'

對。
Yes, that’s right.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
Then how old is your son, and how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
The time when you moved out, your daughter, who did she go with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
At that time, my daughter was only two months old; therefore, she needs my care, so she stayed with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they moved out.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'needs' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'needed'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter stayed with them.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
And now, who is she staying with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '在誰那裏' as 'is she staying with', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text '孩子在誰那裏'.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now, she’s staying with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Now, she’s staying with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Did you have any pact between each other? Why does your daughter stayed with you, and then, she’s staying with your husband now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'pact' does not accurately convey the meaning of '協議' which means 'agreement' or 'arrangement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the second sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Why is your daughter staying with your husband now, after staying with you?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place where I moved out to live is a bit small, and the place where my husband lives is quite large. Therefore, due to the environment and circumstances, I just wished my daughter to live with him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I just wished my daughter to live with him' instead of 'I just wished to live with my daughter with him.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
Okay, so if the objective circumstances do not change, then is your place still not better than your husband’s? Then why did you wish to receive the child’s sole custody?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
Hey, I am the one who bear her for ten months, I can’t live without her. Moreover, my husband is a Canadian, he does not have a fixed income, and he even has the possibility to return to Canada. If so, then I’ll lose the right to visit my daughter. Therefore, I’m here to gain for the custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I am the one who bear her for ten months' should be 'I am the one who bore her for ten months'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I can’t live without her' should be 'I can't live without her'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'he does not have a fixed income' should be 'he did not have a fixed income'.
grammar and structure	agreement errors in number or gender	Agreement error in the sentence 'I’m here to gain for the custody' should be 'I'm here to fight for custody'.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
In terms of your financial status, can you describe how you would raise the child?

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we’re still trying to divorce, and I would like to get the right of living in the place where my husband is now living. Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it would be perfect for my daughter to grow up. As for my current financial status, I have let the court see my asset list. Moreover, I have a very regular income and a very stable job. My monthly income would be no less than forty thousand. Therefore, I believe that I have the ability to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Now, we’re still trying to divorce' should be 'We're still trying to divorce now'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I would like to get the right of living' should be 'I would like to have the right to live'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it would be perfect for my daughter to grow up' should be 'Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it will be perfect for my daughter to grow up'.
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	Missing article in the sentence 'As for my current financial status, I have let the court see my asset list' should be 'As for my current financial status, I have let the court see my asset list'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence 'Moreover, I have a very regular income and a very stable job' should be 'Moreover, I have very regular income and a very stable job'.
grammar and structure	preposition errors	Preposition error in the sentence 'My monthly income would be no less than forty thousand' should be 'My monthly income would be no less than forty thousand dollars'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the word 'dollars' in the sentence 'My monthly income would be no less than forty thousand'.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of the word 'very' in the sentence 'Moreover, I have a very regular income and a very stable job'.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in the sentence 'Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it would be perfect for my daughter to grow up' should be 'Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it would be a great place for my daughter to grow up'.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
Okay, so how is your divorce case going on? Do you know why you will get the verdict, approximately when?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
Well, I’m not sure. We’ll go to the court this Friday again. I would like to ask the court to make a decision of the verdict sooner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
 The court will ask social workers to visit the home of both parties and make an evaluation of each of your ways of taking care of the child. And the court will decide according their report of how you take care of the child. Before this, I would like to ask both parties do you mind of having a shared custody? Shared custody means that the child can stay with her father for a while, and stay with her mother for another while
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Before this, I would like to ask both parties do you mind of having a shared custody?' is incorrect. It should be 'Before this, I would like to ask both parties if you would consider having shared custody?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'do you mind of having a shared custody' does not accurately convey the meaning of '共同持有撫養權' (shared custody).

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
恩，我不太想要耶，因為我女兒還小。她才八個月大。我不想要她一下子陪我，然後一下子又陪我太太。如果是這樣的狀況的話，我的女兒她這麼小，她會覺得很混亂。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree with my husband’s point. My daughter is too young; therefore, shared custody is not the right choice for us.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay, if so, then we’ll just begin our progress of sending the social workers. And after receiving their report, we’ll set up a time to open the court again. Therefore, you two will have the chance of making a statement, okay?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of arranging a social worker visit.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of giving both parties an opportunity to express their opinions.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
恩，好的，社工人員可以來我家。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no problem with that, either, thank you.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, the plaintiff, please, why do you want to have the right to rear your child? As the court investigates, you don’t have a formal job in Taiwan. You haven’t had a formal job in Taiwan yet. Beside, you are a foreigner. Why do you think that you have the capacity to take care of your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'As the court investigates, you don’t have a formal job in Taiwan.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Inconsistent use of tenses in the sentence 'You haven’t had a formal job in Taiwan yet.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Misinterpretation of 'capacity' as 'capacity to take care of your child' instead of 'suitability' or 'qualification'.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	Misinterpretation of 'foreigner' as '外國人' instead of '外籍人士'.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望法院可以判給我全部撫養權，因為兩個原因。首先，我妻子不再跟我一起生活了。我想在這邊看我女兒長大。此外，我還聽說我妻子還跟另外一個男人共處。如果那是真的的話，我就懷疑她是否能撫養我們的女兒。所以我想要有全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我希望法院可以判給我全部撫養權' (I hope the court can grant me full custody). The correct word order should be '我希望法院可以判給我全部撫養權'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我想在這邊看我女兒長大' (I want to be there to see my daughter grow up). The correct verb form should be '我想在這邊看著我女兒長大'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence '我還聽說我妻子還跟另外一個男人共處' (Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man). The word '共處' (living together) does not accurately convey the meaning of 'living with' in this context. It should be translated as '和另外一個男人住在一起' (living together with another man).
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the phrase 'the best care she deserves' in the sentence '我就懷疑她是否能撫養我們的女兒' (I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves). The phrase 'the best care she deserves' is not included in the translation.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of the word '全部' (full) in the sentence '我想要有全部的撫養權' (Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody). The word '全部' is not necessary and changes the meaning of the sentence. It should be translated as '我想要有獨自撫養的權利' (I hope to have the right to sole custody).

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that your wife is not under the same roof with you, and you are dealing with the case about divorce. Besides, you are also suspicious about whether she stays with a other man. Is this the very reason for you to have the sole custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Is this the reason for you to have sole custody?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧' as 'have the sole custody' is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as 'not willing to entrust the children to her care'.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是，這是我的主要原因。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
About your financial status, if you get the sole custody of your daughter, how do you rear your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How do you plan to rear your daughter?'

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有全職的工作。但是我有許多兼職的工作，讓我有固定的收入。我覺得這些收入已經足夠養活我和我的女兒了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在沒有全職的工作。' instead of '現在我沒有全職的工作。'

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have some part-time job. Because these jobs are not formal, do you have the whole overview of your regular income? Whether it is fixed?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有4到5個兼職工作。大約可以讓我賺5萬塊吧。如果我有其他案子的話，收入會更多。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Besides, the court would like to ask another question. Do you plan to bring her back to Canada and do not return to Taiwan after you have the sole custody? The reason for asking this question is that your wife may still have the visitation right after you have the sole custody. If you bring your daughter back to your country, it may evolve into a situation that you cut the tie between your wife and your daughter. About this point, what do you want to say?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important information from the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待了5年了。我己經有了居留證號碼，也喜歡這個地方。我沒有任何離開台灣的打算。我認為，其實女兒有可以看我們雙親的權利。我想要強調一點，雖然我們現在打離婚官司，但我沒有要切斷他們兩個聯繫的意圖。在我們打離婚官司的時候，我還寄了不少我女兒的照片給老婆呢。我甚至安排時間能讓我和女兒、還有我的太太一起出遊呢。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我己經有了居留證號碼' should be '我已經有了居留證號碼'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in sentence: '我沒有任何離開台灣的打算' should be '我沒有任何離開台灣的計劃'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in sentence: '我認為，其實女兒有可以看我們雙親的權利' should be '我認為，女兒應該有權利看到她的雙親'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of details in sentence: '我想要強調一點' should be '我想要強調的是'.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of unnecessary content in sentence: '在我們打離婚官司的時候' should be '在我們離婚的期間'.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in sentence: '我還寄了不少我女兒的照片給老婆呢' should be '我還定期給我妻子寄送我們女兒的照片'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean that recently, you don’t have the plan to return to your country.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
其實我也可能會回加拿大，因為我媽媽很老、很虛弱。如果我回國，也不會待太久，甚至不考慮把我女兒一起拜去加拿大。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation includes unnecessary cultural details that are not present in the original text.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay, now I’m going to ask the other party. Is that true that you don’t live with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been separated for about 6 months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case about your divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About 2 months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is necessary for clarity.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That is to say, before you file the divorce case, you two have not lived together. Is that true?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So, how is your living situation? I mean that who accompanies you, live with you.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son with my first marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I live' instead of 'I lives'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? What is the time of marriage with the plaintiff?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
Therefore, you are seeking to the custody of your daughter, who you have with the second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'seeking to the custody' instead of 'seeking custody'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'you have' instead of 'you had' to match the past tense of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the second husband in their translation.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son with your first marriage?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is 7 years old, and my daughter is about 8 months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
After you move away from your house, you bring your daughter with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because at that time, my daughter was only 2 months, she still needed my support.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the child is with the speaker.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Now, where is your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation changed the word '孩子' (child) to 'your daughter', which is a specific reference and may not accurately convey the original meaning.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
My daughter is living with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you two have any agreements with each other because firstly, she lives with you, and now she lives with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The house I’m living after moving out is smaller than the one that I stayed with my husband. In terms of the environment, I think it is better to stay in the original house with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The house I’m living in after moving out is smaller than the one that I stayed in with my husband.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the environment is better for the child in the new house, but the user's translation suggests that the environment is better in the original house with the husband.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstance about your house is not better than your husband’s house, it is not good for your daughter, isn’t it? Why do you want to have the right to rear your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I had been pregnant about 10 months for the daughter. How can I just give my daughter to my husband? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian. He don’t have regular jobs and formal jobs, I’m afraid that he will go back to Canada. If that is true, I will not see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I would like to strike to have the right to rear my daughter.
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect use of past perfect tense

omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the mention of the possibility of the husband returning to Canada
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the mention of the desire to fight for custody

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your financial status, please elaborate how you will take care of your daughter in the future.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of financial ability or capability to support the daughter.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are still dealing with the case of our divorce. Now, I’m seeking to win, to have the right to live in the original house, which now my husband is living. Therefore, in terms of the living conditions and environment, the original house is better for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have provided a asset list for my income. Besides, I have a formal job in Taiwan, and the regular payment is 40,000 NT dollars. I think that I have the capacity to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Now, I’m seeking to win, to have the right to live in the original house' is incorrect. It should be 'Now, I’m seeking to have the right to live in the original house and win the case of our divorce.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'which now my husband is living' should be 'which is currently being lived in by my husband' to accurately convey the meaning.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The phrase 'the regular payment is 40,000 NT dollars' should be 'I receive a regular payment of 40,000 NT dollars.' The verb tense is incorrect.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of providing an asset list for the court.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of having a formal job in Taiwan.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce case now? Do you have the idea about the exact time to close your divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case going now?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of any scheduled judgment or approximate time for the judgment.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. This Friday, we will attend the court about my marriage. I hope that I will ask the court to have their decision faster and earlier.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'divorce case' as 'marriage'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of attending court again.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of expressing the desire for a quick judgment.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, the court will arrange social workers to visit you two, and these social workers will evaluate in terms of the circumstances about rearing your daughter. We will make further decision in terms of their observation. However, before that, can have shared custody? Shared custody is that your daughter will stay with your husband a whole and later will spend some time with the mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Can have shared custody?' is incorrect. It should be 'Can we have shared custody?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '共同撫養' as 'shared custody' is not accurate. It should be translated as 'joint custody' or 'shared parenting'.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人認為，我不太想要共同扶養權，我女兒還很小，只有8個月大，我不希望她在我跟太太之間送來送去的。對一個只有8個月的小孩來說，一下子跟我住，一下子又跟她媽媽住的話，會讓她十分困擾。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by using the term '共同扶養權' (joint custody) instead of 'changes between me and my wife'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error by placing the verb '送來送去' (send back and forth) before the subject '她' (she).

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
About this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is still too young. It is not appropriate for her to live with the shared custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I agree with my husband about this point.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '共同撫養的安排方式' as 'shared custody', but the correct translation should be 'co-parenting arrangement'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for not agreeing with the shared custody arrangement, which is that the daughter is too young.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Therefore, the court will first arrange social workers to visit with you two parties. After their report and observation, we will further set a court day. Therefore, on that day, you can elaborate further about this case.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Therefore, we will first arrange social workers to visit with you two parties.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social workers' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'report and observation' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'further set a court day' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'elaborate further about this case' in the original text.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好的，我可以接受社工人員的拜訪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
Yes, I’m okay as well for this arranging.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, I am going to know the position of both of you. I also want to know why both of you think that you can have the sole custody. Please elaborate for this point. Besides, you two are under the divorce procedure. Therefore, please do not have verbal attack with each other. Is this okay?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'I am going to know the position of both of you' is incorrect. It should be 'I am going to know both of your positions.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'think' should agree with the subject 'both of you', so it should be 'both of you think that you can have sole custody.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'are' should be in the present continuous tense to match the ongoing divorce case, so it should be 'you two are undergoing the divorce procedure.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of wanting to understand the position on child custody specifically.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Plantiff, why do you strive for the child’s sole custody? As far as I am concerned, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan. You are a foreigner. Why do you think that you have the right to have the child’s sole custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think that you are more suitable?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '適任' as 'have the right' is incorrect. It should be 'more suitable'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the plaintiff not having a full-time job and being a foreigner, which are important details in the context.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
因為以下兩點，所以我想爭取孩子的獨立撫養權第一，我的妻子沒跟我同住，我想看我女兒長大，更何況我聽說我妻子跟另外一個男人住，如果這是真的，我很懷疑她是否能給我們女兒最好的照顧，因此能擁有獨立的撫養權
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that your wife has no longer lived with you, even if you two are still under the divorce procedure? Moreover, you also suspend she is now living with another man? It is because this situation therefore you do not want to give her the custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'suspend' does not match the intended meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the children in the translation.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這是我的主要考量

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
How do you plan to take care of your daughter according to your financial status?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我目前的確沒有全職工作，但我有好幾份兼職，也有穩定的收入，我想這收入足夠我養活我的女兒和自己
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '想' (want) should come before the subject '我' (I).

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because what you did is still the part-time jobs, can you evaluate how much do you earn per month regularly?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
 我平均來說有四五份兼職，總計大概有五萬台幣，有時如果找到新的兼職，我可能還會有額外的收入

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I want to ask that if you get your daughter’s sole custody, will you go back to Canada and never come back to Taiwan again? The reason why I ask this question is that if you get the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, the situation will be that you separate your daughter with her mom. As for this, what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter's custody in the translation.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了，也有了居留證，而我也很喜歡這裡，目前為止我沒有打算離開台灣，另外，我也覺得我女兒有權利見到父母雙方，我想要強調，儘管我跟我太太正在打離婚官司，但我並不想切斷我女兒的聯繫，在我們打離婚官司的過程中，我也好幾次發我女兒的照片給我太太，我甚至邀請她和我女兒一起出遊

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean that you do not plan to go back to your hometown?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
是的，但我可能會回加拿大，因為我母親年老且生病了，但就算我回去，我也不會待太長時間，我甚至不考慮帶我女兒一起去
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我甚至不考慮帶我女兒一起去" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我甚至不考慮帶我女兒去一起".

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay, then I will ask the other side some questions. Now you do not live with your husband, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we live in different places for six months.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case for divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Maybe two months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is necessary for clarity.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That is to say, before you two seek for divorce, you did not live your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
Then who do you live now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
 I live with my son in my first marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I live' instead of 'I lives'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? How about the plantiff?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the plaintiff's marriage.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So you are now striving for the custody of your daughter with the second husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'striving' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'are striving' instead of 'is striving'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'striving for the custody', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '爭的子女撫養權' which means 'fighting for child custody'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the second husband in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the child being a daughter in the translation.

對。
 Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is 7 years old and my daughter is 8 months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, who did your daughter live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
My daughter was with because she was only two months old then.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for the daughter being with the speaker, which is that she needed the speaker's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Who is your daughter living with now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is living with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Now my daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you two have an agreement? Why the daughter first with you and now with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place where I live now is much smaller than the house I lived with my husband before. Considering the environment, my husband’s house is better for my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The place where I live now is much smaller than the house I lived in with my husband before.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '對孩子比較優' as 'my husband’s house is better for my daughter,' which is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as 'better for the child.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
Therefore, in objective circumstances, your place is not good for your daughter, right? Then why do you want the custody of your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by changing the meaning of the sentence.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is the one who I spent ten months to have, how can I live without her? My husband is a Canadian. Besides, his job is not stable. He might go back to Canada anytime. In that case, I cannot see my daughter again. So I want to have my daughter’s sole custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'She is the one who I spent ten months to have'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'My husband is a Canadian'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'He might go back to Canada anytime'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the detail that the speaker gave birth to the daughter
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of unnecessary content in the sentence: 'how can I live without her?'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the detail that the speaker wants to fight for custody of the daughter

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
In the terms of your financial status, can you explain how you are going to rear your daughter?

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are still under the divorce case. I wish the court can let me in my husband’s house. Therefore, as to the environment, that house will be good for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have given the court my current asset list. Besides, I have a regular job and on average, I have NT$40000 per month. Therefore, I am able to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I wish the court can let me in my husband’s house'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'let me in my husband’s house' should be translated as 'let me live in my husband’s house' to convey the intended meaning.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
I would like to ask that how’s your divorce case? When will the trial procedure be set?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case?' instead of 'How's your divorce case?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the part about asking for the trial procedure to be set.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation does not provide any context or background information about the divorce case.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure about that. We have a court this Friday. I hope to ask the judge of my divorce case to have the result quickly.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
The court will send social workers to you and your husband’s houses, then evaluate the situation. The court will make the decision according to the social workers’ report. Before that, I want to ask that will you consider the shared custody? The shared custody is that your daughter will respectively live with mom and dad in a certain period.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The court will send social workers to you and your husband’s houses, then evaluate the situation.' is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'The court will send social workers to your and your husband’s houses, then evaluate the situation.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence 'The court will make the decision according to the social workers’ report.' The correct verb form should be 'makes' to agree with the singular subject 'court'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'husband' should be replaced with 'father' in the sentence 'Before that, I want to ask that will you consider the shared custody? The shared custody is that your daughter will respectively live with mom and dad in a certain period.'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人認為這並不適合，因為我女兒還太小，她只有八個月大，我不想她在我和老婆間換來換去，這對我小孩來說，這會造成我小孩的混亂，當他一下跟爸爸，一下跟媽媽的時候
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
At this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young to have the shared custody about rearing together.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay, then we will first arrange for the social workers’ visit. After getting the report from the social workers, we will set the court date. Both of you have the right to state your opinions.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After getting the report from the social workers, we will first arrange for the social workers' visit.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我對於社工的探訪沒有問題
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
 I also have no questions, thanks.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation is missing the important detail of the subject of the sentence.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'lawyer' from the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today the judge will want to know your positions of the child rearing. We also want to know why you think you are suitable for rearing this child. Please elaborate it according to this point. I know you are also in the divorce case. So we hope that you could avoid the verbal attack.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Today the judge will want to know your positions of the child rearing' is incorrect. It should be 'Today the judge will want to know your positions on child rearing.'

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I would like to ask some questions for both of you. The plaintiff, why do you want to strive for the child rearing rights? As I know, you do not have full-time job in Taiwan. And your identity is foreigner. For this situation, why do you think you are more suitable?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the defendant's reasons for wanting to strive for child rearing rights.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the question for the plaintiff at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the statement about the defendant.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'child rearing rights' as '子女撫養權' which is a direct translation but not commonly used in Chinese. The more appropriate term would be '監護權' or '撫養權'.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
考量這2個原因，我希望能將全部撫養權判給我。第一，我的妻子沒有跟我一起住了。我想要看到我小孩長大。此外，我也聽說我的太太現在跟另外一個男人一起住。如果是這樣的話，我很懷疑他能給小孩一個好的成長環境嗎？所以我希望我能擁有全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '考量這2個原因' should be '考量這兩個原因'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '撫養權判給我' should be translated as 'grant me custody' instead of '判給我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the reason for wanting sole custody, which is the wife living with another man.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
So you mean that your wife is in the divorce case with you, but she does not live with you now? And you doubt that she lives with other man. It is this situation that makes you unwilling to make your children taken care of by her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這就是我主要的考量緣故
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
For your financial status concerns, if you get sole custody, how will you raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
的確，我現在沒有全職工作，但是我現在有兼好幾份打工，足以付足…。我想這些收入足夠撫養我的女兒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '足以' should come before the noun '撫養'.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because they are all part-time jobs, could you evaluate how much regular income you will get?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Could you evaluate how much regular income you will get?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我大概有4到5份的兼職工作。那這樣算起來的話，每個月我大概可以有5萬元的收入，此外我如果還有多一些工作的話，也許收入會增加。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I have another question. If you have the custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and will not come back to Taiwan? I ask this is because that even if you get the custody, your wife still has the visitation rights. If you take your child back to your country, it means that you cut the tie between the mother and the daughter. What’s your idea about this?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's visitation rights in their translation.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待5年了，我有居留證號碼，而且我非常喜歡這個地方。目前為止，我沒有要離開台灣的打算。我也覺得我的小孩有需要見到父母。我要強調，雖然我跟我太太現在在打離婚官司，但我從來沒想過要切斷他與我女兒的聯繫。在打離婚官司的過程中，我有寄我女兒的照片給我太太，我還邀請…
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也覺得我的小孩有需要見到父母' is incorrect. It should be '我也覺得我的小孩有需要見到父母'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean in the short term, you do not plan to go back to your country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
也許吧。因為我母親已經非常老而且生病了。即使我回去了，我也不會留太久。我也沒想過我要把女兒一起帶回去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "也許吧" is incorrect. It should be "吧也許".
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of "may" as "也許" is incorrect. It should be translated as "可能".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase "No, I" at the beginning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase "even if" in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase "I wouldn't stay long" in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase "I won't even consider the possibility of" in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase "taking my daughter with me" in the sentence.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now we want to ask the relative party about some questions. You do not live with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have not lived together for six months.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
So when do you suit the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So before you suit the divorce case, you do not live together?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So who do you live with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son with my first marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I live' instead of 'I lives'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So what’s the…
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So about the child rearing rights, it’s about the daughter with your second husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'child rearing rights' instead of 'child custody'.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? And your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is six months old.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '8 months old' as 'six months old'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you move out, does your daughter live with you or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'is your daughter' instead of 'are your daughter'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I move out, my daughter was only two months old, and she needs me, so she lived with me then.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'move' should be in the past tense 'moved' to match the past tense of 'was' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the daughter still needs the user's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So where did the daughter live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter lives with my husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation changes the meaning of the original text.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between your husband and you? Why does your daughter live with your husband instead of you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '你們中間有什麼協議嗎' as 'Is there any agreement between your husband and you?' instead of 'Do you have any agreement between you?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '原來女兒跟你，現在跟他' as 'Why does your daughter live with your husband instead of you?' instead of 'Why did your daughter used to live with you, but now lives with him?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I move out, the place I live is smaller than the place that my husband lives. For living environment, it will be better for my child, so I let my daughter live with my husband.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So if the objective circumstances, that is, the living environment, does not change, it’s still not good for your daughter, isn’t it? So why do you strive for the custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'So why do you strive for custody?'

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter, and I cannot see her. My husband is a Canadian, and his job in Taiwan is not so fixed, he may go back to Canada anytime. Then, in that case, I will not see my daughter forever. So I hope I can strive for the rearing rights for my daughter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was pregnant for ten months before giving birth to the daughter.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'cannot' instead of 'can't' to match the subject 'I'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband is a Canadian citizen.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband's job in Taiwan is not stable.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker wants to fight for custody of the daughter.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your financial status, how will you afford the raising…?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we are still in the divorce case. I hope I can strive for the rights that I can live in the house that my husband lives now. So for the living environment, that house will be good for my daughter. As for my financial status, I have offered my asset list for the court. Besides, I have the fixed job, that I can get NT$40000 per month. I believe I can raise and take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'So for the living environment, that house will be good for my daughter.' The correct word order should be: 'So, that house will be good for my daughter for the living environment.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'I believe I can raise and take care of my daughter.' The correct form should be: 'I believe I can raise and take care of my daughter.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'strive for the rights' does not accurately convey the meaning of '爭取到' in the original text. It should be translated as 'fight for' or 'seek' instead of 'strive for'.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So how is your divorce case? When will the divorce case have the result?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of any specific details about the divorce case.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not so sure. We will be in court this Friday. I will express to the judge of the divorce case that the decision can be given as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
So the court will send the social workers to visit both of you, and will make the evaluation for how you interact with your daughter. We will make some decision according to the social workers’ report. Before that, I would like to ask will both of you consider the shared custody? Shared custody means that the daughter will live with the husband sometime and live with mother some time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'We will make some decision according to the social workers’ report' is incorrect. It should be 'We will make a decision according to the social workers’ report.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement in the sentence 'Before that, I would like to ask will both of you consider the shared custody?' is incorrect. It should be 'Before that, I would like to ask, will both of you consider shared custody?'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'the daughter' in the sentence 'Shared custody means that the daughter will live with the husband sometime and live with mother some time.' It should be 'Shared custody means that the daughter will live with the husband sometime and live with the mother some time.'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我並不太贊成這個安排，因為我的女兒還太小，他只有8個月大，我不想讓他在我跟我太太之間傳來傳去的。對一個這麼小的小孩來說，如果讓他跟爸爸住一段時間，又讓他跟媽媽住一段時間，這樣會讓他感到非常混亂。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small, it is not suitable for this arrangement.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I agree with my husband.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of '共同撫養的安排方式' (arrangement of co-parenting).

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Ok, we will go through the process of social workers’ visitation. After they do the report, we will set the next court date. Then we will make both of you have the opportunity to state.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Then we will set the next court date.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'social workers' in their translation, which is an important detail from the original text.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'state their opinions' in their translation, which is an important detail from the original text.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好，我同意這個安排。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I also agree, too.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today my major concern is to clarify your will on child custody. I also concerned with why both of you consider yourself fully capable for the sole custody. Please elaborate your view. Beside the child rearing case, I know you’re also up with a divorce case. So I hope there won’t be any verbal attacks in the court.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Please elaborate your view' is incorrect. It should be 'Please elaborate on your view'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the other party's will on child custody. The original text states 'I also concerned with why both of you consider yourself fully capable for the sole custody.'

I understand.
我瞭解了

I understand

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Let me ask you a few question. Plaintiff, why do you want to get the sole custody of your child? Far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan for the time being. And you’re also a foreigner. In fighting for the child rearing right, why do you think you’re more capable?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think you're more capable in fighting for the child rearing right?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'sole custody' as 'child rearing right' is incorrect. 'Sole custody' refers to having full legal and physical custody of the child, while 'child rearing right' is a broader term that encompasses various aspects of raising a child.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the plaintiff not having a full-time job in Taiwan, which is relevant to the question of why they believe they are more capable.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The translation lacks the appropriate level of formality and politeness expected in a court setting.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望能得到我女兒的全部撫養權, 而我有兩個理由. 首先我太太已經沒和我們住在一起了, 我希望能陪伴我女兒成長. 再來我聽說我老婆和另一個男的同居了, 如果這事情是真的, 那我懷疑她可以帶給我們女幸福, 因此我希望能有全部撫養權
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我女兒的全部撫養權' should be '全部撫養權的我女兒'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我女兒的全部撫養權' is translated as 'the sole custody of my daughter' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'sole custody'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the reason for wanting sole custody, which is the wife living with another man and the doubt about her ability to provide the best care for the daughter.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean because your wife is still up with a divorce case with you, but she no longer live with you, is that right? Moreover, you think she’s living with another man. Regarding this situation that’s why you don’t want to share custody with your wife, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'is still up with a divorce case with you'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'she no longer live with you' should be 'she no longer lives with you'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'you think she’s living with another man' should be 'you suspect she’s living with another man'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'Regarding this situation that’s why you don’t want to share custody with your wife' should be 'That's why you don’t want to share custody with your wife'

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對, 這都是我的考量

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Other than that, concerning your financial status, how are you going to raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
確實我現在沒有一份全職的工作, 但是我有兼任好幾份工作並提供我穩定的工作, 我相信我的收入能夠提供我和我女兒足夠的金額
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned you have several part-time jobs, since all of them are part-time jobs, can you make an evaluation about how much exactly you make each month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'can you make an evaluation about how much exactly you make each month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
平均來說我大概有四五份兼職工作, 全部加起來的話一個月大概能賺五萬塊有時如果有接到新案子的話可以賺更多錢
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
And another question, after you get the sole custody of your child, will you take her to Canada and do not return? The reason why I’m asking this question that even if you get the sole custody, your wife still have the visitation right. So if you take your daughter back to Canada, it means that you’re cutting the tie between your wife and daughter. What do you think about that?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'sole custody' in their translation.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣住了五年, 我有這邊的居留權, 我也很喜歡這邊, 目前我並沒有離開台灣的計畫, 特別是我相信我女兒應該有權力能見到她的父母, 我要強調的是雖然我和我太太在打離婚官司, 但我並沒有打算切斷她們母女倆的聯繫, 在離婚官司的過程中我都會寄女兒的照片給她, 我甚至會安排時間為我們大家見面.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我已經在台灣住了五年' should be '我已經住在台灣五年了'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean you don’t have any plan to return to Canada at the moment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you mean' instead of 'You mean'.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不, 我回加拿大的原因只有可能是我媽老了病了. 就算如此我回去也不會停留太久, 我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒一起去
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我回加拿大的原因只有可能是我媽老了病了" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我回加拿大的原因可能只有是我媽媽老了病了".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense in the sentence "就算如此我回去也不會停留太久" is incorrect. The correct verb tense should be "就算如此我回去也不會停留太久".
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun "我" is repeated unnecessarily in the sentence "我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒一起去". The correct sentence should be "甚至不會考慮帶女兒一起去".

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I’m going to ask your wife some questions. You no longer live with your husband is that true?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes we’ve been parting for six months already.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'parting' should be 'separated' to agree with the subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
So when did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Well, about two month ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'applied' in the translation.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So that means, before you file the divorce, you no longer live together right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So what is your living condition at the moment? Who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I’m living with my son from my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So what marriage are we talking here?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He’s my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'husband' in a more formal sense.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the child rearing case is about your second child, which is your daughter
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'child rearing case' instead of 'child custody case'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjective 'second' after the noun 'child', which should be 'second child' instead of 'child second'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the person involved in the child custody case being the speaker's ex-husband.

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son, and how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
After you move out, did your daughter live with you or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'is she' instead of 'is' alone.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
After I moved out, my daughter was just two months old, so she still needs me, and live with me.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'so she lives with me' instead of 'and live with me'.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
What about now? Who does the child live with
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter lives with my husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation changes the meaning of the original text.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Did you have any agreement? Why did she live with you at first, and now with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '協議' as 'agreement' instead of 'arrangement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'live' before the subject 'she' in the second sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter in the second sentence.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I move out, I live in a smaller place, so my husband has a bigger place. The environment is better, so I think she’s better off with my husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '我把孩子交給先生' as 'I think she’s better off with my husband.' The correct translation is 'I entrusted the child to my husband.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
Regardless of the objective circumstances, that’s still not…. Is that better for your daughter? So why do you want to get the sole custody of your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
After all, I’ve had her pregnant for ten months, she’s still my daughter. Besides, my husband is Canadian, and he doesn’t hold a stable job. In this concern, I may never see my daughter again. That’s why I want to get my daughter’s sole custody.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of giving birth to the daughter.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'I’ve had her pregnant' instead of 'I carried her for ten months'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '撫養權' as 'sole custody' instead of 'custody'.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
As for your financial status, can you elaborate how are you going to raise your daughter?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'ability' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'financial' and 'status' in the translation.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far, we’re still up with the divorce case. I’m fighting for the right to live in my husband’s place after the divorce case. Based on the environment, I think my husband’s place would be suitable for my daughter’s growing up. As for my financial status, I’ve provided an asset list for the court. And I also have a job with an income of 40000 NT a month. So I think I’m capable of raising my daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So may I ask how is your divorce case proceeding? Do you know when will the court’s decision be made?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be: 'May I ask how your divorce case is proceeding?'
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the part 'Or is it possible to know roughly when the decision will be made?'

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure, we will be in another court this Friday. I will ask the judge of the divorce case to come up with a court decision as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I will ask the judge of the divorce case to come up with a court decision as soon as possible.'

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
How about we send a social worker to see both of you? So the social worker will make an evaluation based on how you interact with your daughter. We will take that evaluation as reference to see what works the best for your daughter. But before that, have you come to think about share custody? Basically, share custody is to have your daughter spend a certain amount of time with her father, and a certain amount of time with her mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'So the social worker will make an evaluation based on how you interact with your daughter' is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'So the social worker will make an evaluation based on how you interact with your daughter.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement error is present in the sentence 'We will take that evaluation as reference to see what works the best for your daughter.' The correct form should be 'We will take that evaluation as a reference to see what works best for your daughter.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the social worker visiting both the '告訴人' and the '相對人'. The correct translation should include 'both of you' or 'both parties'.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user's translation adds the phrase 'have you come to think about' which is not present in the original text. The correct translation should be 'will you consider' or 'have you considered'.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of '共同撫養'. Instead of using the term 'share custody', the user translates it as 'share custody'. The correct translation should be 'joint custody'.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人是不太贊同這種作法, 因為我女兒還太小, 她才八個月大, 我不希望她經歷我和我太太之間的流離失所, 對這麼小的小孩來說, 讓她以這種方式長大的話她會很困惑
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'changes between me and my wife' as '流離失所' (displacement) instead of '改變' (changes).

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too little, she’s not suitable for a share custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'daughter'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'she’s not suitable for a share custody' does not accurately convey the meaning of '女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式'.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Ok, if that’s the case, we’ll first arrange a social worker to see how it goes. After there’s a result, we’ll arrange the next court time. And that both parties have the chance to elaborate.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After there’s a result, we’ll first arrange a social worker to see how it goes.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of a report being made by the social worker before arranging the next court time.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the mention of both parties having the opportunity to express their opinions.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
Ok, 我接受先讓社工來訪
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'accept' was translated as '接受' which means 'to accept' in the sense of agreeing to something. However, in this context, 'accept' should be translated as 'fine with' or 'okay with'.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I’m fine with that too.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有一個律師。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today, we are going to understand your attitudes towards child custody.And the court also wants why you both think that you have the right to take care of this child.So please elaborate this point particularly.Besides, I know that you are now engaged in a divorce case.So please avoid any verbal attack, please.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'And the court also wants why you both think that you have the right to take care of this child' is incorrect. It should be 'And the court also wants to know why you both think that you have the right to take care of this child.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence 'And the court also wants why you both think that you have the right to take care of this child.'

了解。
Yes, I understand.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
So first, I would like to ask the plaintiff some questions.The plaintiff, why do you want to be granted your child custody.As the court knows, you do not have a full-time job here in Taiwan.And you are a foreigner.On child custody, why do you think you have more custody than the other party?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我想要得到我女兒的單獨撫養權有兩個原因。第一，我的太太不再跟我住在一起了。我希望我可以陪我女兒長大。而且我聽到，我太太和別的男人同居。如果真的是這樣的話，我很懷疑他是否可以提供我女兒應得的照顧。所以我想要爭取撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我想要得到我女兒的單獨撫養權有兩個原因' (I want to get sole custody of my daughter for two reasons). The correct word order should be '有兩個原因我想要得到我女兒的單獨撫養權' (For two reasons, I want to get sole custody of my daughter).

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that you are now engaged in a divorce case and you are no longer living together?And you doubt that your wife is living with another man.Because of the above-mentioned circumstances, you are unwilling to give your daughter to your wife, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'And you doubt that your wife is living with another man' is incorrect. It should be 'And you doubt that your wife is living with another man?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '因為這種情況' as 'Because of the above-mentioned circumstances' is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as 'Because of this situation'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the children in the sentence '你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧'. It should be translated as 'you are unwilling to give your children to her for care'.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這就是我最擔心的原因。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
And regarding your financial status, if you are granted with your child’s sole custody, how can you take care of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在的確沒有全職的工作。但是我有好幾份兼差，也是有固定收入的。我相信這些固定的收入可以讓我和我女兒好好地生活。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在的確沒有全職的工作。'

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs at present.Because these jobs are just part-time, can you approximately estimate how much income is regularly?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均都會有四五個兼差工作。所以我一個月大概都會有五萬塊台幣的收入。如果我有得到更多案子的話，我的收入就會增加。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Is it possible that if you are granted with your child’s custody, you will go back to Canada and never come back again?The reason the courts asks so, even you are granted with the child custody, your wife can be granted with visitation right.If you brought your child back to Canada, it also made your daughter cut the tie with the mother. What’s your opinion to point?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'The question I want to ask' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'asks' before the subject 'the courts' instead of after it.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'cut the tie' as '隔離' which means 'isolate' instead of '斷絕' which means 'sever' or 'cut off'.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣住五年了。我得到了居留證，也很喜歡這裡。目前並沒有離開台灣的計劃。尤其我覺得我女兒應該要有見到他雙親的權利。我想要強調的是，雖然我和我太太正在打離婚官司，但我並沒有想要我女兒和我太太切斷聯繫。即使在我們的離婚訴訟進行中，我也是固定有寄我女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至安排了一些時間，邀請我太太和我女兒一起度過一些時光。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我女兒應該要有見到他雙親的權利' is incorrect. It should be '我女兒應該要有見到她雙親的權利'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So, you mean that in a short time, you are not intended to go back to your homeland, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'So, you mean that you are not intended to go back to your homeland in a short time, right?'

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
是的，目前沒有這個計畫，但如果有一天我媽媽老了又生病的話。即使我回去，應該也不會待很久。我甚至也不會考慮帶我女兒一起回去。
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense in the translation is inconsistent with the original text. The original text uses the present tense ('my mother is old and sick'), while the translation uses the future tense ('如果有一天我媽媽老了又生病的話').
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The original text has 'I may go back to Canada', while the translation has '是的，目前沒有這個計畫' which means 'Yes, currently I don't have this plan'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker wouldn't consider taking their daughter with them. The original text explicitly states 'I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me', but this information is not present in the translation.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now, the court would like to ask the defendant some questions. Are you no longer staying with your husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Are you no longer staying with your husband?'

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been no longer living together for six months.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
I filed the case around two months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is 'I'.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So, before you filed the divorce, you hadn’t lived with your husband for a long time.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense should be past perfect tense 'hadn't lived' to indicate an action that occurred before another past action.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
What is your current living circumstances? I mean who are you living with now
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
Now, I am living with my son of my ex-husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So which marriage is it with the plaintiff.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
Now, the child custody we are here for is between the second husband, for the daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
And how old is your son, and how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight-month old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter' in number, so it should be 'eight months old' instead of 'eight-month old'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, was your daughter left by your husband or you brought her with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out, my daughter was only two-month old; therefore, I brought her with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needed the mother's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
And where is the child now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now, my daughter is living with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is living with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there an agreement between you? Why you brought your daughter with you, and she is now with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I moved out, I found an apartment which is smaller than the place my husband is living. Taking living circumstances into consideration, my husband’s place is better than mine.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'my husband's place' instead of 'husband's place'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '對孩子比較優' as 'my husband’s place is better than mine'. The correct translation should be 'in terms of the environment, it is better for the children'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances remain the same, that is, your living environment, this is not better for your daughter, right? Why do you want to be granted with your child’s custody?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I gave birth to my daughter, so how could I be separated from her? And my husband is a Canadian, and he does not have a stable job here. He may go back to Canada at any time. If that is the case, I will never my daughter again. Therefore, I hope to be granted with my daughter’s custody.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the duration of the pregnancy, which is important for understanding the context of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'be' instead of 'see' in the phrase 'I will never my daughter again.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the husband's unstable job as a reason for potential separation from the daughter.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
As to your financial status, how could you afford your daughter’s spending?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we are still engaged in a divorce case. So, I would like to ask to live in the apartment my husband lives now after our divorce. Based on the living environment, the apartment will be suitable for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have provided my asset list to the court. Besides, I have stable job, my regular income is at least 40000 NT dollars per month. So, I think I have the ability to rear my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'So, I would like to ask to live in the apartment my husband lives now after our divorce.' The correct word order should be: 'So, I would like to ask to live in the apartment my husband lives in now after our divorce.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'Based on the living environment, the apartment will be suitable for my daughter to grow up.' The correct verb form should be 'is' instead of 'will be' to match the singular subject 'apartment'.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
And how is your divorce case going? Do you know the estimated date that the court’s decision comes out?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be: 'How is your divorce case going?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'your' in 'your divorce case'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'the court's decision' in 'the court's decision comes out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'estimated date' in 'the estimated date that the court's decision comes out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'the court's decision' in 'the court's decision comes out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'the court's decision' in 'the court's decision comes out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'the court's decision' in 'the court's decision comes out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'the court's decision' in 'the court's decision comes out'.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. We have another court this Friday. I would like to ask the judge of the divorce case to give the court’s decision as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
So, the court will arrange some social workers to visit both of your places, the plaintiff and the defendant. And evaluate your relations with your daughter from your both sides. The court will take the social worker’s evaluation into consideration to give the court’s decision to make sure what is suitable for the child. Before that, the court would like to make sure that have you ever considered to share the custody? The shared custody means the child will live with the father for some time, and live with the mother for some time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'The court will take the social worker’s evaluation into consideration to give the court’s decision to make sure what is suitable for the child.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'The court would like to make sure that have you ever considered to share the custody?'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the phrase 'from your both sides' in the sentence 'And evaluate your relations with your daughter from your both sides.'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of the phrase 'to give the court’s decision' in the sentence 'The court will take the social worker’s evaluation into consideration to give the court’s decision to make sure what is suitable for the child.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase '共同持有撫養權' in the sentence 'Before that, the court would like to make sure that have you ever considered to share the custody?'
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	Addition of the phrase 'The shared custody means the child will live with the father for some time, and live with the mother for some time.' in the sentence 'Before that, the court would like to make sure that have you ever considered to share the custody?'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不太考慮這一點，因為我女兒還太小。他只有八個月大而已。我不想要他跟經歷我和太太的離異過程。對一個那麼小的小孩來講，可能會造成他認知上的混淆，如果他必須跟他的父親住一段時間，又再去跟母親住一段時間的話。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'She is only 8 months old.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'go through the changes between me and my wife' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'experience the changes between me and my wife.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'stay with one parent for a certain period of time and then with the other parent.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of not wanting the daughter to go through the changes between the parents.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the confusion it may cause for the daughter.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
As to this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young to arrange this way at such a young age.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I agree with my husband on this point.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not suitable for co-parenting arrangement.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
If that is the case, we will schedule first the visits of the social workers. After they finish their evaluation, we will schedule our next court date. So, the both parties have the chance to state your opinions. Is that all right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'So, both parties have the chance to state their opinions.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
是的，我接受社工來訪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no problems, too. Thank you.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today what I mainly want to do is to understand what is your standpoint on your child custody, and I would also like to know why you think you are the more appropriate one to rear the child. Please focus on this point and elaborate. In addition, I know you are also filing for a divorce case, so I hope that won’t make any verbal attack each other. Is that OK with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Please focus on this point and elaborate' is incorrect. It should be 'Please focus on this point and elaborate on it.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'won't' should be 'don't' to match the subject 'you'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the preparation procedures in the original text.

了解。
OK, I understand.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I would like to ask the plaintiff some questions. Why would you like to…why would you like your child’s custody? As far as I am concerned, now in Taiwan you don’t have a full-time job. You are a foreigner. On the matter of child custody, why do you think you are the more appropriate person?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why would you like custody of your child?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'child custody' as 'child's custody', which changes the meaning slightly.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the plaintiff not having a full-time job, which is an important detail in the context of the question.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the plaintiff being a foreigner, which is another important detail in the context of the question.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我主要…我想要就是全部的小孩撫養權有兩個原因。首先，我的太太沒有再跟我們一起住了，我想要在那裡看我女兒長大，而且我聽說我太太跟另外一個男人住在一起。如果是那樣子的話，我懷疑她到底能不能給我們的小孩最好的照顧。因此，我希望有全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我主要…我想要就是全部的小孩撫養權有兩個原因'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
What you mean is that although your wife is still going on a divorce case with you, she no longer lives with you, and you also doubt that she lives with another man. So…because of the…based on the above reasons, you don’t want the child to be raised by her, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，這是我主要的顧慮。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
As to your financial status, that is to say, if you don’t have a full-time job, how are you going to raise your child…your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實是沒有全職的工作，但是我有幾個…幾個工作，收入也很固定。這個固定收入可以讓我照顧我自己跟我的女兒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有幾個工作' instead of '我現在是沒有全職的工作'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '收入也很固定' is translated as 'the income is also fixed' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'regular income'.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just said that you have several part-time jobs. Because all of them are part-time jobs, can you estimate how much income you have each month?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均來說有四到五份兼職工作，全部加起來的話，每個月大概有五萬多塊台幣，如果我有其他額外的工作的話，收入可能會更多。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another thing I want to ask is that, is it possible that after you get your child’s custody, you will take her to Canada and not coming back? The reason I ask is that although you get your custody, your wife still have the visitation right, and she can regularly visit your daughter. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, you will be indirectly cutting the tie between them…between your wife and your daughter. So…about this, what is your opinion?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the father taking the child to Canada after getting custody.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待五年了。我有居留證，而且我蠻喜歡…我很喜歡這裡。我目前沒有離開台灣的打算，而且我覺得小孩有權利見他的父母。我想說的是，就算我現在要跟我老婆離婚，我沒有打算要切斷我女兒和我老婆的聯繫。在打離婚官司的期間，我…就是定期會傳女兒的照片給老婆看。我甚至還會…就是安排一起出去玩，讓老婆也可以看看小孩。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我蠻喜歡…我很喜歡這裡'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Incorrect translation of 'my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents' as '小孩有權利見他的父母' which means 'the child has the right to see his parents'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'I have an ARC' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'I want to emphasize that' in the translation

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter' in the translation

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So what you’re saying that so far you don’t have a plan…to go back to Canada, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
對，我有可能會回去，但只是因為我媽年紀大了或生病之類的，但是就算我回去，我也不會待太久。我根本就不會想要把女兒一起帶去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我媽年紀大了或生病之類的" is incorrect. It should be "我媽年紀大了或生病之類的".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb "回去" should be future tense to match the original text. It should be "我會回去".
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase "我根本就不會想要把女兒一起帶去" does not accurately convey the meaning of "I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me."

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I would like to ask the other party some questions. Do you no longer live with your husband now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been separated for six months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you…when did you file your divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That is to say, before you filed your divorce case, you longer live together, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So who do you live with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son, who is the child of my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So…this time…
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the question about the number of marriages.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the custody we’re not talking about is…with your husband and is a daughter…your daughter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'the custody we're not talking about', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order should be 'is a daughter...your daughter'.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
So how old is your son? How old is your daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is five months old…eight months old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'eight months old' instead of 'five months old'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you are…separate with your husband, is your daughter with you or with your husband…was.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When…because at that time my daughter was only two months old, she needed my care, so I took her with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about moving out.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used '孩子跟我' instead of '我帶著孩子'.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So where is…where is the child now? Is she with you or with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Where is the child now?' instead of 'So where is...where is the child now?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is with my husband.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Did you have some sort of negotiation before? Why is your…why was her with you a few months ago, and now she is with your husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '協議' as 'negotiation' instead of 'agreement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter's change in relationship from the original text.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I moved out, my house was smaller. The one I lived with my husband is bigger. Because the environment is better, I sent my daughter to my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'After I moved out, my house was smaller' is incorrect. It should be 'After I moved out, my house became smaller.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'The one I lived with my husband is bigger' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'The one I lived in with my husband is bigger.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the environment is better in the new place. It should be 'Because the environment is better, I sent my daughter to my husband.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So…if the objective circumstances are not changed...your living place, the environment is still better for your daughter, right? So why do you want your child’s custody, then?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter who I spent ten months bearing…ten months…how would I bear not seeing her? And my husband is Canadian. He’s work in Taiwan is not very stable. He will possibly go back to Canada at any time. In that case, I wouldn’t see my daughter anymore, right? So I would like to…so I would like to have my daughter’s custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'She is my daughter who I spent ten months bearing…ten months…how would I bear not seeing her?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'And my husband is Canadian. He’s work in Taiwan is not very stable.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'He will possibly go back to Canada at any time.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'I hope to' in the sentence 'So I would like to have my daughter’s custody.'

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Based on your financial status…can you…can you tell us how you are going to rear your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we are still going on the divorce case. I hope that now we can let our daughter live in my husband’s house now. Based…in concerned of the environment, the house is better for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have give…I have gave…I have given the court my asset list. In addition, I also have a full-time job, I income every month is 40,000 dollars. I think I am capable of raising my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Based…in concerned of the environment'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I income every month is 40,000 dollars'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'provide' in the sentence 'I have give…I have gave…I have given the court my asset list'.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce case going on now? Do you know when…when…when we will see the result, or about when we will see the result of the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not quite sure. We will go on the court for the divorce case on this Friday again. I hope that I can tell the judge of the divorce case that the sentence be granted as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'sentence' should be 'judgment' in this context.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Maybe…we will ask a social worker to regularly visit the plaintiff and the other party and make some evaluation based on seeing your relationship between you and your daughter. The court will…will take reference of their reports and see which party is better of raising the child. Before that, I would like to ask if you both…are you willing to have shared custody? That means that your daughter will be living with husband…with her father for a while and with her mother for another time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Before that, I would like to ask if you both…are you willing to have shared custody?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '本庭' as 'the court will' instead of 'the court'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親' which means 'for a while with the father and for another time with the mother'.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this issue, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small for…to young for shared custody...to be raising by shared custody…to be raised custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'Our daughter is too young for shared custody.'

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So, if that is the case, we will arrange for social worker’s visit. After we read their reports, we will arrange our next trial to let both of you state your standpoint. Is that OK with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'After we read their reports, we will arrange our next trial to let both of you state your standpoint.' The correct word order should be: 'After we read their reports, we will arrange our next trial to let both of you state your standpoint.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social worker' in the sentence: 'So, if that is the case, we will arrange for social worker’s visit.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
嗯，我覺得社工探視可以。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '我覺得' (I think) is added, which changes the meaning to 'I think social workers' visits are okay' instead of simply stating 'I am fine with social workers' visits.'

沒有問題，謝謝。
I don’t have any questions…It’s also OK with you…with me.

你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
So why did you help him to take the golf bag to taiwan
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker in the translation.

He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
他說他會給我美金一千塊作為江高爾夫球帶帶來的酬勞。我想要賺一點小錢，我想說這是一個很簡單的工作。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '江高爾夫球' (golf) is used instead of '袋子' (bag).

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
The cell phone you just answer, is that cell phone is the confiscate in the tauyuan international airport
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of the cultural reference 'confiscate'

Yes, a Nokia phone.
對就是那隻nokia 的手機
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '隻' is used to count small animals or objects, not for phones.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the investigatory file, which is important for understanding the context.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
對這是他給我的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is this your personal cell phone?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'this', so it should be 'Is this your personal cell phone?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不是這不是我的手機。這隻手機是肯特的，他把sim卡插進那隻手機裡面然後交給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不是這不是我的手機' instead of '不是這不是我的手機'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'mobile phone' is translated as '手機' which is correct, but the word 'phone' is translated as '手機' again, resulting in repetition and incorrect meaning. It should be translated as '手機' in the first instance and '隻' in the second instance.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the mobile phone was given by Kent. This detail is important for understanding the context.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷的前一天把手機交給我。除了手機之外，他還給我400塊美金供我在旅館的吃住

他說他會透過這隻手機跟我聯絡
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他說他會透過這隻手機跟我聯絡'.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
So you mean that after you arrive to Taiwan, there will be someone who get contact with you,and then meet you and take the golf bag, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea of someone contacting and meeting the person to take the golf bag.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對，肯特跟我說在我入境後不久，就會有人跟我聯絡並拿走高爾夫球袋
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bag' as '高爾夫球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of the intended meaning of 'bag'.

不，我不知道誰會打給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You just mention that beside the golf bag and the cell phone,he also  give you 400 us dollars. Is this monetary compensation too?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '算是酬勞嗎？' as 'Is this monetary compensation too?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks if the 400 US dollars can be considered as compensation, not if it is too much.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想這些錢應該是用來支付我旅館的開
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of meals in their translation.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
Beside these 400 dollars, after you go back to Tailand, you will get another 1000 us dollar,right? is that what you mean?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After you go back to Thailand, will you get another 1000 US dollars?'

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
對這是我的認知。在我把這個高爾夫球袋交給別人之後，我就會回到泰國，然後得到這1000塊美金的酬勞
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and coming back to Bangkok to receive another thousand dollars, while the user's translation talks about handing over a golf bag to someone and receiving a reward of $1000.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
Before you accept this please, did you know it was heroine?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '海洛因' as 'heroine' instead of 'heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不我完全不知道，我不知道毒品藏在高爾夫球袋裡面。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'club' as '高爾夫球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of '俱樂部' which means 'club'.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you doubt that he just send you to bring the gold to Taiwan.  And this monetary compensation, which this 1000 us dollars, isn’t that little bit high?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我是不知道這代價是否太高，我只知道這些錢很好賺。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'that's too much' is translated as '這代價是否太高' which means 'whether the price is too high' instead of 'if that's too much'.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you ever wonder why don’t that person just bring the golf bag by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特說他很忙碌，他需要有個人來幫他。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'need' should agree with the subject 'Kent', so it should be 'he needs' instead of 'he need'.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even though you know what you bring is gold, you should know that bring the gold might be illegal , isn’t it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed in the translation.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道黃金在曼谷其實算是便宜了，但我不知道把黃金帶來台灣是不是合法的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the gold is cheaper in Thailand, but the user's translation states that gold is actually cheap in Bangkok.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of Bangkok as the location where gold is cheaper. This detail is important for understanding the context of the statement.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why don’t you think that there will be no problem to bring the gold to Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就是黃金，它應該不會帶來任何麻煩吧？
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Did you check the bag before you take the golf bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of checking the contents of the bag.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
不我沒有，因為那個袋子是密封的。我不覺得我應該要把它打開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'No, I didn't because that bag was sealed.'

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
So you trust him, and you don’t think you will be conned.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月的時候遇到肯特，我想那個時候我會為他工作，甚至跟他合作。他看起來是好人，我也不覺得他會騙我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我想那個時候我會為他工作，甚至跟他合作" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我想那個時候我會跟他合作，甚至為他工作".

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
You mean that Kant seem to be cooperate with you ,so you trust him, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by changing the meaning of '不疑有他' (not doubting him) to 'trust him'.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對我以為我們會一起當工作伙伴，所以我信任他。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我信任他' instead of '對我以為我們會一起當工作伙伴，所以我信任他。'

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
Do you have anything to add beside what you just mentioned?Is there any evidence that you want to ask court to help you investigate.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'Is there any evidence that you want to ask court to help you investigate.'

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我對整件事情感到很抱歉。我不知道那個袋子裡有什麼東西。如果我知道裡面是海落英的話，我是絕對不會把它帶來台灣的。

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
Except for Kant, do you have any more concrete information that may help the police to help you to find who gave you the bag?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我就只有他那隻手機而已。

他叫我在曼谷的一家肯德基跟他碰
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'KFC' as '肯德基' which is the Chinese translation of KFC, instead of using the original English term.

你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
Then why would you help him carry the golf bag to Taiwan?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'him' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
我想賺錢啊 這對我來說是一個輕鬆的工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這對我來說是一個輕鬆的工作，我想賺錢啊。'

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
You mean he will give you the monetary compensation of 1000 us dollar for just bringing the bag to Taiwan, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
對阿 他跟我說我不用做其他的事,只需要把袋子帶到台灣就好
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the person only needs to bring the golf bag to Taiwan, while the user's translation suggests that the person does not need to do anything else.

對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
Then, did he tell you what would happen after you get into Taiwan? I mean, would there be anyone getting into contact with you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他叫我待在一間旅館裡,然後就會有人打電話到他給我的手機

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
The cellphone mentioned, is it the one that was confiscated by the police at the Taoyuan International Airport?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '扣案' as 'confiscated' instead of 'seized'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the police in their translation.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
對阿是一隻諾基亞的手機
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '手機' (mobile phone) is used instead of 'phone'.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
Now let’s look at the evidence, the defendant please verify that is it the cellphone you just mentioned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
對 這就是肯特給我的那支手機
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Does it belong to you?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'belong' should agree with the subject 'it', so it should be 'Does it belong to you?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
沒有 這不是我的!這是肯特給我的阿,他把sim卡放到裡面,然後給我這支手機
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這不是我的!' instead of '沒有 這不是我的!'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'No' as '沒有' is incorrect. The correct translation should be '不是' to convey the meaning of 'No' in this context.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'mobile phone' in the second sentence, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'Kent' in the second sentence, which is an important detail in the original text.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對 他就是在肯德基給我這支手機的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
Then when did he give you the cellphone? Other than the cellphone, did he give you any other things?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did he give you the cellphone?'
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'Then' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the question mark at the end of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation incorrectly places the word 'Other' before 'than'. It should be 'Other than the cellphone'.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'any' before 'other things'. It should be 'did he give you any other things?'

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我這支手機,除了手機之外他還給我美金四百元來付旅館及吃飯的費用

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
What’s the purpose that he gave you the cellphone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他說他會透過這支手機跟我聯絡 還有要來拿這個高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這支手機跟我聯絡
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他說他會透過這支手機跟我聯絡，還有要來拿這個高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這支手機跟我聯絡。'

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
That is, when you bring this cellphone to Taiwan, there will be somebody contact you and make an appointment with you to take the golf bag, right?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對阿 肯特跟我說我來台灣之後會有人打給我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying that someone was going to contact and meet the user to take the bag, the user's translation mentions that someone will call the user after they arrive in Taiwan.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Then did you know who would contact you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
沒有耶 我不知道誰會打給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You’ve mentioned that other than the cellphone, Kent also gave you 400 us dollar, was that part of the monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我覺得這筆錢應該是用來支付我的旅館還有吃飯的費用而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'just' in the original text, which indicates that the payment is limited to hotel bills and meals only.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So you mean besides the 400 us dollar, after you successfully go back to Thailand, you will get another 1000 us dollar, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '美金' as 'us dollar' instead of 'USD'.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
就我所知是這樣啦,在我來台灣把這個包包交給那個人之後,我就會回去泰國然後拿到那一千元
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不  我完全不知道球桿裡面有藏海洛因
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think if he just asked you to bring gold to Taiwan, the monetary compensation, that is 1000 us dollar, is a little bit high
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我也不知道這個酬勞有沒有太高/ 我就想多賺一點錢啊
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I don't know if that's too much', the user's translation says 'I don't know if the remuneration is too high'.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Then did you wonder why that guy wouldn’t bring it by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
他跟我說他很忙 需要有人幫他
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他跟我說他需要有人幫他很忙'.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even though what really in the golf bag was gold, you should have known that carrying gold into Taiwan may violate the law, isn’t it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '入境' as 'into Taiwan' instead of 'entering the country'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'isn't it?' instead of 'isn't it?' to match the subject-verb agreement.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我只知道黃金在泰國比較便宜 可是我不知道帶來台灣會犯法耶
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why would you think it’s okay to bring gold to Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
就只是黃金阿 也不會有什麼大問題吧
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Did you check the thing inside when you get this bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'inside' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有耶 因為袋子封起來了 我不覺得打開他是洽當的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為袋子封起來了，所以我不覺得可以打開它。'

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
So you trust Kent that much, don’t you think you may be conned?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月遇到肯特 那個時候我可能會替他工作 我們也可能會成為夥伴  他看起來人很好啊 我不覺得他會騙我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'work mates' as '夥伴' which means 'partners' instead of '同事' which means 'colleagues'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '在三月' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb '遇到'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that there was a possibility of becoming work mates in the future.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
You mean Kent wanted to cooperate in business you so you trust him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對阿 我就覺得我們會一起工作  所以我才這麼相信他
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
So other than the question you have answered, is there anything you want to state? Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我真的感到很抱歉 我不知道袋子裡面有什麼 他們跟我說是黃金阿 如果我當時知道是海洛因的話 我絕對不會把他帶到台灣的  拜託啦 原諒我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' which means 'gold', but the original text mentioned 'heroin'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'I don't know what was hidden in the bag' in their translation.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
You are detained now, is there anyone you want us to inform
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'on your behalf' which is important for conveying the meaning that the person being detained wants someone else to be informed.

Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
可以幫我聯絡我在曼谷的家人或在英國的小孩嗎?他們一定很擔心我 我本來12月底要回去曼谷

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.

下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。
The next court will be investigatory procedure, you can choose the lawyer, and after you have chosen the lawyer, the lawyer will contact you and understand the case, do you understand? If it’s necessary, your lawyer can help you contact you family. Do you understand?

Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
肯特跟我說 他叫我待在他指定的旅館就會有人打給我跟我接洽 手機也是他給我的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他叫我待在他指定的旅館，就會有人打給我跟我接洽，手機也是他給我的。'

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
So the cellphone you mentioned is the one which is confiscated in Taoyuan International Airport by police?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '扣案' as 'confiscated' instead of 'seized'.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
對啊 那是一隻諾基亞手機
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
Evidence one, please check this phone is the phone you just said?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
對 這就是肯特給我的那支手機
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'cell phone' is translated as '手機' which is correct, but the name 'Kent' is translated as '肯特' instead of '肯特'.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is that your personal cellphone?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'cellphone', so it should be 'Is that your personal cellphone?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不是 這不是我的手機 這是肯特給我的 是他把SIM卡放進這支手機的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這不是我的手機' (This is not my phone).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '是肯特給我的' (It is given to me by Kent).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
So do  you mean this cellphone is the the one who makes you to carry the golf bag?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對啦 他就是在肯德基的時候一起給我的啊
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
What’s the date he gave you the cellphone? Except cellphone, did he give you any other things?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What's the date he gave you the cellphone?'
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'date' in the question.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'the' before 'cellphone' in the question.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
What’s the destination he gave you the cellphone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他告訴我他會用這支手機跟我聯絡 另外 他也跟我說 那個會來拿高爾夫球袋的人會打這支電話
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
So you mean after you took this phone into Taiwan, there are some one will get into contact with you? Meet you for the golf bag?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of the original text

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對 肯特跟我說當我到答台灣之後就會有人連絡我跟我拿高爾夫球袋
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying that someone will contact and meet the user to take the bag, the user's translation mentions someone contacting and taking a golf bag.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know who will contact with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you know who will contact you?'

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
沒有 我不知道誰會跟我聯絡
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You just mentioned, besides the cellphone, the man gave you USD 400, is that the monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '酬勞' as 'monetary compensation' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想那四百元應該是給我當食宿費用用的吧
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the meaning of the original text.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So do you mean, beside the 400 dollars, when you get success and back to Thailand, you will get more 1000 US dollars?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '拿到' as 'get more' instead of 'get'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'more' before '1000 US dollars' instead of after it.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
是的 這就是我所理解到的內容 當我跟拿高爾夫球袋的人碰面之後 我就會回到泰國  得到我該得到的酬勞
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits important details from the original text.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The translation misinterprets the cultural reference of bringing a bag into Taiwan.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So do you know you were carrying heroine when you accept this job?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'heroine' is used instead of 'heroin', resulting in a different meaning.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
我真的不知道 我不知道海洛因會藏在高爾夫球袋裡面
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user translated 'club' as '高爾夫球袋' (golf bag) instead of '俱樂部' (club).

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
 Don’t you feel the monetary compensation is a little bit too high for just carry the gold into Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不覺得這代價有怎麼樣  我只是想賺些外快
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you ever think about why didn’t this man carry the bag to Taiwan?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'bag' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'carry' instead of 'carried'.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特跟我說他很忙需要有人幫他
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'need' should agree with the subject 'Kent', so it should be 'needs' instead of 'need'.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even it is gold in the golf bag, you should know carry the gold into Taiwan might be illegal, shouldn’t you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question form.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道在泰國黃金比較便宜 但我真的不知道攜帶黃金進來是違法的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the user knows that gold is cheaper in Thailand, but does not know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan. However, the user's translation states that they know gold is cheaper in Thailand, but they don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why don’t you think carrying gold into Taiwan is not illegal?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就是黃金而已啊  應該不會有很大的問題吧
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Did you check the bag when you get the bag?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有我沒檢查 因為袋子是封死的 我不覺得我有權力去打開這個袋子
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有檢查' instead of '沒有我沒檢查'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'I don't think I can open a bag' as '我不覺得我有權力去打開這個袋子' is a mismatched meaning. The original text implies that the speaker is unsure of their ability to open the bag, while the translation suggests that the speaker does not have the authority to open the bag.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
 Don’t you think you were coned by trusting him so much?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '受騙' as 'coned' which does not accurately convey the meaning of being deceived.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月遇到肯特 然後我覺得我們有可能變成工作夥伴啊 就是一起工作這樣 我覺得他看起來是個不錯的人啊 應該不會有甚麼問題
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'work mates' as '工作夥伴' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. 'Work mates' refers to the possibility of working together, while '工作夥伴' simply means 'work partners'.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
Do you mean, you feel the sense of cooperate with you, so you think it is possible to work with him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the sentence.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
沒錯 我覺得我可以跟他一起工作 這就是為什麼我覺得可以信任他
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'That's why I trust him so much,' the user's translation says 'I feel like I can work with him.'

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
So, besides you just answered, anything to add? Do you want the court to make investigation for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'Do you have any additional evidence?' from the original text.

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我對於帶毒品進來真的感到很抱歉 我不知道那裏面有甚麼 如果我知道那裏面是毒品不是黃金的話我就不會有想把他帶進台灣的念頭 拜託請原諒我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' (gold), but it should be '金' (money).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '帶' (bring) before the object '進來' (in), which should be reversed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the bag being hidden, which is an important detail in the original text.

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？

對,他在KFC給我這支手機的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
when did he give you this cell phone? In addition to the cell phone, did he give you anything else?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did he give you this cell phone?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'this cell phone' in the question.

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
在我離開曼谷前一天,它給我這支手機.除了手機,它還給我400塊美金當作是住宿和吃飯的費用.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '在我離開曼谷前一天,它給我這支手機'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '它' is used instead of '他', which changes the meaning of the sentence. '它' means 'it' in English, while '他' means 'he'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the $400 being for restaurant bills and meals.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
what ‘s his purpose of giving you this cell phone?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'purpose' is translated as 'what's his purpose' instead of 'what's the purpose'

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他告訴我他會用這支手機跟我聯絡,會跟我接洽拿袋子的人也會用這支手機跟我聯絡.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他告訴我他會用這支手機跟我聯絡，也會用這支手機跟我接洽拿袋子的人。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'pick up golf bags' as '拿袋子' is incorrect. The correct translation should be '拿取高爾夫球袋'.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
That is to say, when you bring this cell phone to Taiwan, there is someone contacting with you and meet you to get this golf bag?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the cultural context

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對,Kent告訴我說當我到台灣之後,會有人跟我碰面拿這個袋子.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我到台灣之後, 會有人跟我碰面拿這個袋子'.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know who will get into contact with you?

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不知道,我不知道誰會跟我聯絡
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
what you just mentioned is that besides the cell phone, the man also give you 400 us dollars, is that kind of monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using the phrase 'monetary compensation' instead of '酬勞', which means 'remuneration' or 'payment'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想錢是住宿跟吃飯的費用.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals,' the user's translation says 'I think the money is for accommodation and meals.'

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
so, you mean that when you come back to Thailand, you will get another 1000 us dollars, besides 400 us dollars?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
據我了解是這樣.當我到台灣把袋子交給在台灣接洽的人,回到泰國後我就能拿到另外的一千美元
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and getting another thousand dollars when returning to Bangkok. However, the user's translation mentions handing over the bag to someone in Taiwan, which is not mentioned in the original text.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
so when you accept this ask, did you know it is heroine?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'heroine' is translated as '海洛因' which means 'heroin' in Chinese, instead of '女主角' which means 'female protagonist'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不不,我不知道在袋子裡的是海洛因.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think that if he just ask you to bring gold into Taiwan, this monetary compensation, that is 1000 us dollars, is too high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '代價' as 'monetary compensation' instead of 'price' or 'cost'.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道到底是不是很高拉,但是我只是想賺一些外快
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'if that's too much' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'just want to make a little extra money' in the translation.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Do ever think that why not this man bring this by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
Kent告訴我說他很忙,所以它需要別人幫他.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb '需要' (need) should come before the noun '別人' (someone).

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even though there is exactly gold in the golf bag, bringing gold into Taiwan is against the law, isn’t it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning by using 'against the law' instead of 'possibly illegal'.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道泰國的黃金很便宜,但是我不知道是不是帶黃金到其他 國家就違法
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the user knows gold is cheaper in Thailand, but does not know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan. However, the user's translation states that they know gold is cheap in Thailand, but they do not know if it is illegal to bring gold into other countries.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
why do you think that there is no problem if you bring gold to Taiwan
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就是黃金阿,不會有太大的問題吧.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Have you checked the items inside when you get this bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user added the word 'this' which is not present in the original text.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有,我沒有檢查,因為袋子封起來了.而且我也不認為我可以打開他.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有檢查，因為袋子封起來了。而且我也不認為我可以打開它。'

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
Did you really trust Kent? Have you never thought that you might be conned?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月的時候跟Kent見面,妳知道我們可能是夥伴或者我就是幫他工作而已,它看起來人是不錯拉,我不覺的他會騙我.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '夥伴' (huǒ bàn) is not an accurate translation for 'work mates'. It should be translated as '工作夥伴' (gōng zuò huǒ bàn).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '妳知道我們可能是夥伴或者我就是幫他工作而已' is incorrect. It should be '我們可能是夥伴，或者我就是幫他工作而已' to separate the two possibilities.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the possibility of becoming work mates was discussed when they met in March.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the user thinking they can work for Kent.

cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not adapt the idiomatic expression 'work mates' to the target language.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
you mean that Kent wanted to cooperate with you of some business, so you don’t doubt about that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
是的,我以為我們是夥伴,這就是為什麼我相信他.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'That's why I trust him so much,' the user's translation says 'I thought we were partners, that's why I trust him.'

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
In addition to what you just mentioned, do you have any further statement? Is there any evidence that you want the court investigate for you?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我真的很抱歉這件事.我真的不知道袋子裡有什麼.我只知道袋子裡是黃金,如果我知道是毒品的話,我就不會這樣做了.請原諒我.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' which means 'gold', but the original text mentioned 'heroin'.

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
Apart from Kent, do you have any more concrete information that helps the police to investigate who ask you for help?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about providing specific details that can help the police identify the person who hired the interpreter.

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？

可以幫我聯絡在曼谷的家人或是在英國的小孩嗎?他們一定很擔心我.我本來是要在12月底回曼谷的.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the user being supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.

下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。
The next court would be investigation procedure. You can choose a lawyer. The lawyer can contact with you and understand the situation, do you understand? If necessary, your lawyer can contact your family for you. Do you fully understand?

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?

不不不我不知道我不知道我要帶的東西是海洛因。

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這是Kent給我的手機'.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？

他跟我說他會透過這隻手機來連絡我，而且要來拿這個袋子的人也會透過這隻手機來連絡我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the object.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
You meant after you get into Taiwan, someone will call this cell phone to contact with you and meet with you to take the golf bag?

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
恩沒錯，Kent跟我說當我抵達台灣之後有人會來跟我拿這個高爾夫球袋。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'bag' as '高爾夫球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of the intended meaning of 'bag'.

Do you know who will contact with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我不知道誰會連絡我。

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
Did you know there is heroine in the bag before you were hired?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '海洛因' as 'heroine' instead of 'heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不不不，完全不知道海洛英被藏到球桿裡面，完全不知道。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I really didn't know', the user's translation says 'I completely didn't know'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the club where the heroin was hidden.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think the price is too high for you to only take gold in Taiwan? Isn’t the price too high?

我知道在泰國黃金比較便宜，但我不知道把黃金帶到台灣是否會違法
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

However, the user's translation states that they know gold is cheaper in Thailand, but they do not know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？

Do you remember there are some drugs in your clubs?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation completely changes the meaning of the original text.

No, I don't.
我不知道。我怎知道袋子裡面藏有毒品
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states 'No, I don't.' which indicates a lack of knowledge or information. However, the user's translation states 'I don't know. How do I know there are drugs hidden in the bag?' which implies a statement of uncertainty rather than a denial of knowledge.

這高爾夫球袋是誰給你的？在哪裡給你的？
Do you know who gave the golf bag and where did he or she give to you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The name of the guy who gave me the bag was Kent. I met him in Bangkok and he hired me to work for him. I am a computer engineer. He gave me this one ball bag at a KFC in Bangkok.
這高爾夫球袋是一個叫肯特的人給我的。  我和他在曼谷碰面並且  邀請我做這份工作。我是個電腦工程師，而他在曼谷的肯德基給我這個袋子

semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The cultural reference to KFC was not translated correctly, as '肯德基' (kěn dé jī) is the Chinese translation for KFC, but the original text mentioned KFC in Bangkok.

給你高爾夫球袋、要你把它帶入台灣的人是誰？ 你認識他嗎？知道對方的姓名嗎?
Please tell me who gave the bag and ask you to send it to Taiwan. Do you know who he or she is and the name?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about someone giving the bag and asking to send it to Taiwan.

Kent是對方的姓、還是名？這是他的真名嗎？
 Do you mena Kent is first name or last name? Is this his true name?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.

semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '扣案' as 'caught by police' instead of 'confiscated'.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
是的，就是那隻諾基亞的手機
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes the specific brand 'Nokia' instead of using a more general term for 'phone'.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'phone' is translated as '手機' which means 'mobile phone' instead of '電話' which means 'phone' in general.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
 Do you remember the date he gave the cell phone? Besides cell phone, what else did he give to you?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific day when the person gave the cell phone.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'intention' is not the appropriate translation for '目的' in this context.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
 他告訴我會用這支手機和我連絡，此外，要拿袋子的人也會打這支手機和我連絡。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他告訴我會用這支手機和我連絡，此外，要拿袋子的人也會打這支手機和我連絡。'

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
In other words, if you take this cell phone to Taiwan, somebody will contact you and met you to take the bag?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation misinterprets the cultural context and transforms the original meaning.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
是的，肯特告訴我，當我入境台灣，就會有人打這手機和我聯絡拿袋子。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '當我入境台灣' is translated as 'when I enter Taiwan,' which is not mentioned in the original text.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you who will contact you?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
 我不知道誰會和我聯繫
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
Besides the cell phone, you also mention four hundred US dollars. Is this also the monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omits the word 'monetary' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想這400只是支付我住宿和吃飯的錢
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions 'paying hotel bills and meals', while the user's translation mentions 'paying for accommodation and meals'. The user's translation does not include the word 'bills' and changes the word 'hotel' to 'accommodation'.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
Besides four hundred dollars, when you return to Thailand successfully, you will also get one thousand dollars, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '400元' as 'four hundred dollars' instead of '400 yuan'.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
我的理解是這樣，當我把袋子給在台灣接應的人之後，回泰國就會拿到1000美金
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and coming back to Bangkok to receive another thousand dollars, while the user's translation talks about giving the bag to someone in Taiwan and receiving 1000 US dollars upon returning to Thailand.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
When you received the task, you know the bag you take is heroine, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '帶的是海洛因' as 'the bag you take is heroine', which has a mismatched meaning. The correct translation should be 'the bag you brought is heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
 我一點也不知道袋子裡面藏有海洛因
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club,' the user's translation says 'I didn't know at all that heroin was hidden inside the bag.' The user changed 'club' to 'bag' and omitted the word 'at all,' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think that if someone ask you to take gold to Taiwan, and the price is 1000 US dollars, the price is a little high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道這樣行情是否有點高，但我只想賺點小外快。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. 'I don't know if that's too much' is not equivalent to '我不知道這樣行情是否有點高'.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you ever wonder that why he came to here by person?

The incident happened at Taoyuan International Airport on December 5th, 2013. And the incident is that the defendant was found that there was drug in his gulf bag in his suit case. After the examination, the drug is actually heroine and it weighs 1380 grams. According to Narcotics Act in our country, heroine is classified as level one drug. Therefore the prosecutor has accused you of drug trafficking. To this accusion(accusation), what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And the incident is that the defendant was found that there was drug in his gulf bag in his suit case.'

給你高爾夫球袋、要你把它帶入台灣的人是誰？ 你認識他嗎？知道對方的姓名嗎?
 So who gave you the gulf bag and asked you to bring into Taiwan?Do you know him and do you know his or her name?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'gulf' is incorrectly translated as '高爾夫' which means 'golf' in Chinese, instead of 'gulf' which means '海灣' in Chinese.

grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the wrong tense in the translation. '民國102年' should be translated as '2013' instead of 'March 2013'.

Kent是對方的姓、還是名？這是他的真名嗎？

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the question about the person's name.

I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.
 我想這是他的真名吧，但是我不知道他的姓氏是甚麼。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'real name' as '真名' which means 'true name' instead of '真實姓名' which means 'real full name'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'full' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？
Where did he give you the gulf bag?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Where did he give you the golf bag?'

He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
他告訴我在曼谷的一家肯德基會面。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'KFC' as '肯德基' which is the Chinese translation of the brand. It should be translated as 'ケンタッキーフライドチキン' in Japanese.

你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
Why did you help him to bring the gulf bag to Taiwan?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'gulf' should be 'golf'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Why did you help him bring the golf bag to Taiwan?'

He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
他告訴我他會付給我1000美元如果我幫他帶這個高爾夫球帶來台灣的話。我想要賺一點錢啊，所以我想這應該是個很簡單可以賺錢的工作。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
Did you say that Kent asked you to bring this gulf bag to Taiwan and he promised you to pay you $1000USD for monetary compensation, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'gulf' should be 'golf'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the bag being brought into Taiwan.

Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
是的，他告訴我只要把這個球袋帶來台灣就可以了，不用做其他任何事情。

他告訴我要待在指定的飯店然後會有人打手機給我。那手機也是他給我的。

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
The cellphone you mentioned is the one the police confiscated in Taoyuan International Airport?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '扣案' as 'confiscated' instead of 'seized'.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
是的，那是一支諾基亞的手機。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes the brand name 'Nokia' in the target language, which is an unnecessary cultural transformation.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
 Please check the Evidence One. Defendant, is this cellphone actually the one that you mentioned?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'check' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'is' instead of 'was' to match the past tense of 'mentioned'.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
是的，那就是肯特給我的手機。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'Yes, that is the cell phone Kent gave me' as '是的，那就是肯特給我的手機。' The word '給' means 'to give' in Chinese, but it is not necessary in this context. The correct translation would be '是的，那就是肯特给我的手机。'

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is this your personal cellphone?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'this', so it should be 'Is this your personal cellphone?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不，這不是「我的」手機。這是肯特給我的啊，他在裡面放入了SIM卡然後再交給我。
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun 'my' is missing in the translation.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
Did you mean that this cellphone was given by the person who asked you to bring the gulf bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'gulf' should be 'golf'.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對，他在肯德基一起交給我的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. '一起交給' is not equivalent to 'gave me' in this context.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
When did he give you the cellphone? What’s the date? And besides cellphone, did he give you anything else?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did he give you the cellphone?' instead of 'When did he give you the cellphone?'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the question about the date. It should be 'What's the date?' instead of 'What's the date?'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the question about whether he gave anything else. It should be 'And besides the cellphone, did he give you anything else?' instead of 'And besides cellphone, did he give you anything else?'

他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我手機的。 除了手機之外，他還給了我400美金當作食住費用。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我手機。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'restaurant bills and meals'.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
What was his purpose to give you this cellphone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他說他會透過這支手機聯繫我。有可能要來拿球袋的人也會透過這個手機連絡我吧。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the second sentence is incorrect. It should be '也有可能要來拿球袋的人'

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
That is, if you entered Taiwan, there would be a person calls(calling) you via this phone and asked(asking) to take the gulf bag.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'gulf' should be 'golf'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'calls' should be 'calling'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'asked' should be 'asking'.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
是的，肯特告訴我當我抵達台灣的時候會有人跟我拿這個球袋。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bag' as '球袋' which means 'ball bag' instead of '袋子' which means 'bag'.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
 Do you know who would get contact with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you know who you would get in contact with?'

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我不知道誰會聯絡我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不知道誰會聯絡我。'

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You’ve mentioned that in addition to the cellphone, the person gave you $400USD, is this so-called monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '算是酬勞嗎？' as 'so-called monetary compensation', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想這筆錢只是我的食宿費用而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of translating 'paying my hotel bills and meals', the user's translation suggests that the money is only for their accommodation and meals.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
Besides this 400 dollars, when you arrive in Thailand successfully after giving the gulf bag, you will get another 1000 US dollars, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'gulf bag'

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
我的理解上是這樣。當我把高爾夫球袋交給別人，回到泰國之後，我就會拿到另外的1000美金。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user translated 'bring the bag into Taiwan' as '交給別人' which means 'hand over the golf bag to someone else'. This is a mismatched meaning.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
When you receive the bag, do you know there is heroine inside?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '海洛因' as 'heroine' instead of 'heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不，我完全不知道海洛因就藏在裡面。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club', the user's translation says 'I had no idea that heroin was hidden inside.'

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you feel that if the man just asked you to bring the gold in(to) Taiwan, and the monetary compensation, that is $1000 USD, wasn’t this price too high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '代價' as 'monetary compensation' instead of 'price'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'wasn't' before 'this price' instead of after.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
這個價錢到底算不算高我不知道，但是我只是想要賺錢啊。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I don't know if that's too much', the user's translation says 'I don't know if this price is considered high'.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you thought that why don’t that person just bring the bag by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
他告訴我他很忙啊，所以他需要有人來幫他。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The subject and verb should be in the correct order.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even if there is gold in the gulf bag, not heroine, but you should know maybe brought(bringing) gold into Taiwan may violate the law, isn’t it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '高爾夫球袋' as 'gulf bag' instead of 'golf bag'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'bringing gold into Taiwan' instead of 'brought gold into Taiwan'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'not' in the sentence, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道黃金在泰國比較便宜，但是我並不知道攜帶黃金入境台灣到底違不違法欸。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why would you think that to bring gold into Taiwan wouldn’t become a problem?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就只是黃金啊。應該不會有甚麼大問題吧？
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
When you picked up the bag, did you check the product inside?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of checking the product inside the bag.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
我沒有欸，因為那個袋子被封起來了。我不認為我有這個權利打開它。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不認為我有這個權利打開它。'

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
Why did you trust him so much? Don’t you think that you might be cheated?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Don't you think that you might be cheated?'

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
因為我在三月的時候就已經遇到他啦，他那時候還要聘請我幫他工作，所以我本來還有可能是他員工的。他感覺人很好啊，不想是會說謊的樣子。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning. The original text mentions the possibility of becoming work mates, but the user's translation suggests that the person was already going to hire the user for work.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
Did you mean that the person had also showed his will to cooperate with you to do some business, so you don’t doubt him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對，我想我們本來是會一起工作，所以我才很信任他。

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我真的對於事情的發生感到很抱歉。我真的不知道袋子裡裝甚麼。如果我知道袋子裡是海洛因的話我就不會帶來台灣了。請原諒我。

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
 Beside(s) Kent this name, do you have further concrete information that can help the police to know who is the person that asked you to bring the bag?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Beside Kent, do you have further concrete information that can help the police to know who is the person that asked you to bring the bag?'

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我只有他給我的那支手機。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只有那支他給我的手機。'

被告Julio Johansen於中華民國102年12月5日入境桃園國際機場時，被查獲行李箱中之高爾夫球袋藏有毒品，經檢驗後為海洛因，重量達1380公克，海洛因為中華民國所列之一級毒品，因此檢察官起訴你運送毒品之罪，對此罪名，有何辯解？
2013 December fifth Julio Johansen entered Taoyuan International airport and he was found that there are drugs in his golf bag in the suitcase. After investigating the drugs verified as heroin and weigh about one thousand and three hundred eighty kilograms. Heroin is level one narcotics in our law, therefore the prosecutor charged you of the crime against Narcotics Act. What is your plead?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'there are drugs in his golf bag in the suitcase' should be 'there are drugs in his golf bag inside the suitcase'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The weight of the drugs is given as 'one thousand and three hundred eighty kilograms' instead of '1380 grams'.

I plead no guilty.
我認為我無罪
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'plead' should be followed by 'not guilty', not 'no guilty'.

請問你此行出發地為何？
What is your purpose of this trip?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I departed from Bangkok, Thailand.
我要飛往台灣
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I departed from Bangkok, Thailand', the user's translation says 'I want to fly to Taiwan'.

你在幾月幾日搭乘飛機？飛機航班為何？途中有無轉機?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the flight date and flight number.

你所帶的高爾夫球袋，是隨身行李還是託運行李？
The golf bag you have is carry-on or checked-in luggage?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'you' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'carry-on' and 'checked-in', resulting in a grammatically incorrect sentence.

It was my carry-on.
是我的隨身行李
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'carry-on' was translated as '隨身行李' which means 'hand luggage' instead of '隨身攜帶物品' which means 'carry-on'.

你知道高爾夫球袋中，有幾根桿子嗎？
Do you know how many clubs in the golf bag?

I don’t know a few, maybe.
不知道，就幾支吧

那你知道球桿中藏有毒品嗎？

The name of the guy who gave me the bag was Kent. I met him in Bangkok and he hired me to work for him. I am a computer engineer. He gave me this one ball bag at a KFC in Bangkok.
我一個朋友在曼谷給我的
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details such as the name of the person (Kent), the fact that the bag was given to the user, and the user being hired to work for Kent.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention the user's profession as a computer engineer.

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses the word '朋友' (friend) instead of '一個人' (a person) to refer to Kent.

給你高爾夫球袋、要你把它帶入台灣的人是誰？ 你認識他嗎？知道對方的姓名嗎?
Who gave you the golf bag and ask you to take it to Taiwan ? Did you know him or her? You know the name?

I only know him as Kent, we met earlier in March 2013.
他叫做肯特
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'Kent' as '肯特' is incorrect. The correct translation should be '肯特' or '肯特恩'.

Kent是對方的姓、還是名？這是他的真名嗎？
Kent is the first name or the last name? Is it a real name?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the question about the name Kent as a statement about the name Kent.

I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.
我覺得那是他的真名，是他的名
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the name mentioned should be the person's real name, but the user's translation only mentions that it is his name without specifying if it is his real name.

他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？
Where did he give you the gold bag?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Where did he give you the golf bag?'

He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
他和我約在曼谷的一家肯德基
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'KFC' as '肯德基' which is the Chinese translation of KFC. This is an inappropriate cultural transformation as the original text mentioned 'KFC' in Bangkok, indicating that it should be translated as 'KFC' in the target language.

你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
why would you help him to bring the golf bag to Taiwan?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'him' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
他請我把高球袋拿來台灣，他會給我1000元美金
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bag' as '高球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of '袋子' which means 'bag'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part where the person mentioned 'paying' and 'making money'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part where the person mentioned 'easy job'.

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
you mean that he promise to give you one thousand dollars as monetary compensation to bring the golf bag to Taiwan, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '代價' as 'monetary compensation' instead of 'price' or 'cost'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'promise' before the subject 'he', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.

對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
Did he tell you what would happen after you arrive Taiwan? I mean,
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the second part of the sentence.

Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
他有給我一隻手機，會有人打過來
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying that someone would call the cell phone number given by Kent, the user's translation states that Kent gave the user a cell phone and someone would call.

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
The cell phone you mentioned is the one that police confiscated at the Taoyuan International Airport?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '扣案' as 'confiscated' instead of 'seized'.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
是的
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'Nokia phone' as '是的' which means 'yes' in Chinese, instead of using the correct translation for 'Nokia phone'.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
Please check the evidence one. Is this the cell phone you just mentioned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
對 就是這個
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '對' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'Yes' in this context.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is this cell phone belong to you?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'belong' should be in the third person singular form 'belongs' to agree with the subject 'this cell phone'.

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不，這是他給我的
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the phone being a mobile phone and Kent putting the SIM card into it.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
You mean this cell phone belonged to the person who ask you to bring the gold bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '委託' as 'ask' instead of 'belonged to'

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'phone' is translated as '對' which means 'to' or 'for' in Chinese, instead of the correct word '手機' which means 'phone'.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
When did he give you the cell phone? Beside the cell phone, did he give you any other thing?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'cell' before 'phone' in the second sentence.

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他給我手機還有400元美金用來食宿
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他給我400元美金還有手機用來食宿'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of Bangkok, which is an important detail in the original text.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
What is the purpose he gave you the cell phone
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the purpose or use of the cell phone.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他說我到台灣之後，會有人從這支手機打過來
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the part about the person wanting to pick up golf bags contacting them through the mobile phone.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
That is to say, when you took the cell phone into Taiwan, someone would call you and meet you to take the golf bag?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation misinterprets the cultural context and transforms the original meaning.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the bag that was going to be taken.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know who would get connected with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我不知道
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You said the person gave you the cell phone and four hundred dollars as well. Is that part of the compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '酬勞' as 'compensation' instead of 'payment' or 'reward'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
那400元是用來付飯店還有飲食的費用
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
Therefore, beside this four hundred dollars, when you went back to Thailand, you would get one thousand dollars?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
對
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So when you took the promise, you knew it was heroin?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '帶的是海洛因' as 'you knew it was heroin', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text implies that the person knew they were carrying heroin when they accepted the promise, not that they knew the promise itself was heroin.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
我不知道，我以為他要我帶的是黃金
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation completely changes the meaning of the sentence by replacing 'heroin' with 'gold'.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
don’t you think that if ask you to bring gold to Taiwan, the price is too high ?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '帶黃金入台灣' as 'bring gold to Taiwan' instead of 'bring gold into Taiwan'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'ask' before the subject 'you' instead of 'if'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the cost of 1000 US dollars in their translation.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我沒想過這個
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'if that's too much' from the translation.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you ever wondered that why the person did not bring it by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
我不知道，我只是想賺點錢
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not convey the original meaning of Kent asking for help because they translated it as 'I don't know, I just want to make some money.'

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
If what in the golf bag was really gold, you should know bringing gold in to another country can be illegal, don’t you think so?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我沒想那麼多，只是帶黃金而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why would you think it is not a problem to bring gold.?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就只是黃金而已呀
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Did you check what is in the bag, when you took it?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'inside' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有，因為他交給我的時候袋子是密封的，我覺得我應該不能打開它
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the bag was sealed, while the user's translation states that the bag was handed to them sealed.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
You trusted him. You didn’t feel that he might con you
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月的時候就認識肯特了，我們有可能成為工作夥伴，我想他不會騙我的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'work mates' as '工作夥伴' which means 'work partners' instead of '同事' which means 'colleagues'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form '認識' instead of '遇到' to match the past tense of 'met'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that there was a possibility of becoming work mates in the future.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
You mean that he wanted to work with you so you did not feel he may lie to you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
是的
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the reason for trusting him.

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
Beside Kent, do you have other specific details for the police to find the who give you the job?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'specific' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
沒有
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail of not having a cell phone.

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
Now you are still detained, is there someone you want us to inform for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
我想要聯絡我在曼谷的家人還有在英國的孩子，我早要回去了，他們一定很擔心我

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	he was found hiding drugs should be he was found to be hiding drugs
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of the defendant's plea

I plead no guilty.
我請求無罪
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'plead' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I plead not guilty.'

請問你此行出發地為何？
So, where are you heading to?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '出發地' as 'heading to' instead of 'origin'.

I departed from Bangkok, Thailand.
我從泰國出發的

這高爾夫球袋是誰給你的？在哪裡給你的？
So, who gave you this gulf bag? And where did he give you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The name of the guy who gave me the bag was Kent. I met him in Bangkok and he hired me to work for him. I am a computer engineer. He gave me this one ball bag at a KFC in Bangkok.

給你高爾夫球袋、要你把它帶入台灣的人是誰？ 你認識他嗎？知道對方的姓名嗎?
Who gave you the gulf bag and ask you to take it into Taiwan?Do you know that person? Do you know what’s his name?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'gulf' should be 'golf'.

I only know him as Kent, we met earlier in March 2013.
我只知道他的名字叫肯特,那我是2013年3月的時候遇到他的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'Kent' as '肯特' which is a transliteration of the name, but it does not convey the same meaning as 'Kent'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '2013年3月' at the end of the sentence instead of before the verb '遇到'.

Kent是對方的姓、還是名？這是他的真名嗎？
Is Kent his surname or his last name? Is his real name?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '對方的姓' as 'his surname' instead of 'the other party's surname'.

I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.
我想那是他的真名….吧
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I don't know what his last name is' as '我不知道他的真名' which means 'I don't know what his real name is'. The meaning of 'last name' was not accurately conveyed.

他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Where did he give you the golf bag?'

He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
他跟我約在曼谷的一家肯德基
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'KFC' as '肯德基' which is the Chinese translation of KFC. This is an inappropriate cultural transformation as the original text mentioned 'KFC' in Bangkok, indicating that it should be translated as 'KFC' in the target language.

你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
So why did you help him with the carrying of the gulf bag into Taiwan?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'golf' in the translation, resulting in a loss of important information.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'gulf' before 'bag' instead of 'golf', resulting in a word order error.

He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
他跟我說 他會給我1000塊美金, 只要我把這個高爾夫球袋拿到台灣來我想要賺點錢啊,而且這又還蠻簡單的
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'dollars' as '塊美金' which is not the correct term for 'dollars' in Chinese. The correct term is '美元'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bag' as '高爾夫球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of '袋子' which means 'bag' in general.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '拿' (bring) before the object '這個袋子' (this bag), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '把這個袋子拿到'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
Do you mean by that he asked you to carry this gulf bag into Taiwan and he will give you 1000 dollars…USD, is it correct?

Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
是的,他跟我講說只要把這個袋子帶到台灣就好了,而且不用做任何其他的事情
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb '帶' (bring) should come before the object '這個袋子' (this bag).

對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
So, did he tell you what will happen next as long as you arrive at Taiwan, I mean, is there/will there be anyone to… get into contact with you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
肯特跟我說叫我去某一家飯店之後會有個人打電話給我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. 'Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.' is translated as '肯特跟我說叫我去某一家飯店之後會有個人打電話給我', which means 'Kent told me to go to a certain hotel and someone will call me.' The user omitted the information about staying at the hotel and only mentioned going to the hotel.

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
The cell phone you just mentioned, is the one…. the police confiscated at…. the Taoyuan international airport?

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the police in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the location being the Taoyuan international airport.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
對就是那支Nokia手機
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '支' is not necessary in this context.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
Please check the proof…the evidence one, is this..is this the cell phone you just mentioned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
對, 就是這支手機, 就是肯特給我的手機
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me,' the user's translation says 'Yes, this is the cell phone, the cell phone Kent gave me.'

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is this cell phone your personal cell phone?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'this cell phone'.

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不, 這不是我的手機, 這支手機是肯特給我的, 這是他放了sim卡後給我的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這支手機是肯特給我的'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone before giving it to the user.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
Do you mean by that… this cell phone is given by the one who asked you to carry the gulf bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text and changes the meaning.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對, 他在肯德基把手機給我
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'phone' is translated as '手機' which means 'mobile phone' instead of 'phone' which can refer to any type of phone.
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness. In English, it is common to say 'he gave me this phone at KFC' instead of 'in KFC'.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
When did he give you this cell phone? Did he give you any other stuff?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did he give you this cell phone?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'this cell phone' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question about whether the person gave any other stuff.

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷的前一天把手機給我的, 除了手機他還給我了400塊美金,說這是當作旅館和食物的費用
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他在我離開曼谷的前一天把手機給了我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'cell phone' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'restaurant bills and meals' in the translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '說這是當作旅館和食物的費用' which is not present in the original text.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
So what’s his purpose of giving you this cell phone?
semantic conversion	omission of details	missing the specific purpose or use of the cell phone

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他說他會透過這支手機連絡我, 他也說, 到時候跟我拿這個包包的人會打電話給我啊! 會打這支手機
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of golf bags in the translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '到時候跟我拿這個包包的人' which is not present in the original text.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
That is to say, you mean when you take this phone and get into Taiwan, there will be someone call this phone and contact you, and meet you and take the gulf bag?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of the original text

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對, 肯特告訴我說, 會有一個人跟我聯絡, 然後跟我拿這個包包
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '肯特告訴我說, 會有一個人跟我聯絡, 然後拿這個包包跟我'

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
So do you know who will contact you?

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
我不知道誰會打給我, 我不知道那個人是誰
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不知道誰會打給我'.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You have mentioned he also gave you the 400 USD, is this counted as the monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我認為那四百塊美金是我住和吃的費用
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions 'paying hotel bills and meals', while the user's translation mentions '住和吃的費用' which translates to 'cost of staying and eating'. The user's translation does not specify that the payment is for the hotel bills and meals.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So, do you mean that in addition to this 400USD, after you successfully return to Thailand, you will get another 1000 dollars?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '美金' as 'dollars' instead of 'USD'.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
我是這麼認為的, 只要我到了台灣把這個袋子拿給那個人, 之後我就可以回到泰國,並且領取我那1000美金
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and getting another thousand dollars when returning to Bangkok, while the user's translation talks about giving the bag to someone in Taiwan and receiving 1000 US dollars.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So, did you aware of that you will carry the heroin when you accept this case.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不不不, 我真的不知道竟然是把海洛因藏在我的袋子裡
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the sentence by stating that the heroin was hidden in their bag, instead of inside the club.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you feel that if he asked you to carry gold into Taiwan, this price, that is 1000 USD, is too high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '這個代價' as 'this price' instead of 'this cost'.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不太清楚這個價格是不是太高, 我不太清楚行情, 我只是覺得想賺點錢
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I just want to make a little extra money', the user's translation says 'I just feel like making some money'.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you….. ever thought of ….why didn’t he carry the…. bag himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特告訴我說他很忙, 所以需要一個人幫助他
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '肯特告訴我說他需要一個人幫助他，因為他很忙。'

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even if it is gold in the golf bag, you should have known that …carrying gold into Taiwan will… violate the law, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '入境' as 'into Taiwan' instead of 'entering the country'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'will' before the subject 'carrying', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'highly valuable' when translating '黃金' as 'gold'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'golf bag' when translating '高爾夫球袋' as 'golf bag'.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道在泰國金價比較便宜, 但我沒有想過說把黃金帶入台灣會犯法
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
How come you think it will not cause any problems to carry gold into Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就只是黃金, 應該不會有太大的問題吧
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
When you received the bag, did you check the things inside?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of receiving the bag.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'received' and 'the bag'.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
我沒有耶, 因為那被封起來了, 我也不覺得說我可以把它打開
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有耶, 因為那被封起來了, 我也不覺得說我可以把它打開'.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
You just trust others? Don’t you think you will be conned?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月的時候遇到肯特,原本是我要替他工作,或是一起合作,我們可能會是工作夥伴,我覺得他人看起來不錯啊, 我沒有想到他會騙我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of 'possibility' as '原本是我要替他工作,或是一起合作' (originally I was going to work for him, or work together).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in '我覺得他人看起來不錯啊' (I think he looks good). The correct word order should be '我覺得他看起來人不錯啊' (I think he is a good person).

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
What you mean by is he has shown the willingness to do business with you, so you trust him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對啊, 我那個時候就想說我們會一起合作,所以…我就相信他
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
So, in addition to the questions you have answered, … is there any other word you want to add? Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'So, in addition to the questions you have answered,' which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?' which is an important detail in the original text.

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我對於這件事真的感到很抱歉, 我真的不知道袋子裡面有什麼, 我以為那個袋子裡面是黃金, 如果我知道裡面是海洛因,我絕對不會…答應把他們帶來台灣, 拜託, 請原諒我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' which is correct, but translated 'heroin' as '海洛因' which is also correct. However, the user used the phrase '絕對不會...答應把他們帶來台灣' which means 'definitely would not...agree to bring them to Taiwan'. This does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text which states 'I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan'. The user should have used a phrase like '絕對不會把這個袋子帶來台灣' to accurately convey the meaning.

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
In addition to the man Kent, is there any concrete information which can help the police to investigate the one who ask you to carry the bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of carrying a bag, which is an important detail in the original text.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我只有那一支他給我的手機而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'cell' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
So far, you’re in detention, is there anyone you hope we can help you to inform?

可以幫我連絡我在曼谷的家人或者是我在英國的孩子嗎?他們一定很擔心我, 我原本是要在十二月末的時候就要回到曼谷的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'contact' as '連絡' which means 'get in touch with' instead of '聯繫' which means 'contact'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.

下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。
The next court will be trail procedure, you have the right… to a lawyer, and after hiring a lawyer, you two can meet and understand the case, do you understand your right? If it is necessary, your lawyer can help you to contact your family. Do you understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	審理程序 (trial procedure) was translated as 下一次出庭 (next court)

Yes, I understand.
我明白了

檢察官有沒有需要進一步調查的證據？
Is there any other evidence the prosecutor want to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about meeting the person earlier.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time information after the verb instead of before it.

Kent是對方的姓、還是名？這是他的真名嗎？
Kent is the person’s fist name or last name? … Is Kent his real name?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '對方的姓、還是名' as 'the person's fist name or last name' instead of 'Is Kent his first name or last name?'

I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.
我想這應該是他的真名，但我不知道她得姓氏

He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
他跟我講在曼谷的肯德基一點見面。

cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user translated 'meet him at a KFC' as '一點見面' which means 'meet at a point' in Chinese, instead of using the appropriate expression for meeting at a specific location.

你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
Why did you need to help him to bring the golf bag to Taiwan?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is 'you'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'need' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'did you need' instead of 'did you needed'.

He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
他答應我說，如果我幫他這個忙的話，他會給我一千塊美金。我想賺點錢，那這件事情又不難。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'pay me' as '給我' is incorrect. It should be translated as '付給我'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '如果我幫他這個忙的話' is incorrect. It should be '如果我幫他這個忙的話'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of bringing the bag to Taiwan, which is an important detail in the original text.

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
So you mean the person promised to pay you one hundred US dollars as rewards. …The premise is you have to bring this golf bag to Taiwan, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '美金' as 'US dollars' instead of '美金' which means 'Taiwanese dollars'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'promised' before the subject 'person', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the golf bag in their translation.

Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
是的，他只叫我把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，其他事情他都沒有交代
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the person who told them to bring the golf bag.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'nothing else' as '其他事情他都沒有交代', which means 'he didn't give any other instructions'. This does not convey the meaning of 'bringing nothing else'.

對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
Then did the person tell you what you have to do after you came to Taiwan? …Will there be anyone to contact with you?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about someone contacting the person in Taiwan.

Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
他叫我待在某一家飯店 那在特定的時間就會有人連絡我…用他給我的這支手機
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'designated' was translated as '某一家' which means 'a certain' instead of '特定的' which means 'specific'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omitted the information that Kent gave the cell phone number.

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
You just mentioned the cell phone so is the cell phone the cell phone that the police found at the Taoyuan International Airport.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '警方在桃園國際機場' as 'the police found at the Taoyuan International Airport', which is a cultural transformation error.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
對，那是一支諾基亞的手機
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '支' is not necessary in this context.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
Okay, please see this. Can you … recognize the cellphone is the cell phone you just mentioned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
是的，這就是肯特給我的手機
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. 'Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.' is translated as '是的，這就是肯特給我的手機', which means 'Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.'

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Does this cell phone belong to you?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'belong' should agree with the subject 'this cell phone', so it should be 'belongs' instead of 'belong'.

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不，這不是我的手機這是肯特給我的手機，他把SIM卡放進去然後給我的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這是肯特給我的手機'.
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after '手機'. The correct sentence should be '這不是我的手機，這是肯特給我的手機'.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
Do you mean that this cell phone is given by the person who asked you to bring this golf bag to Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the context of bringing a golf bag to Taiwan.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對，他在肯德基給我這支手機的
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'phone' is translated as '手機' which means 'mobile phone' instead of 'phone' which can refer to any type of telephone.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The cultural reference to KFC is not accurately translated. '肯德基' is the Chinese translation for KFC, but it is not commonly used in English. It would be more appropriate to use 'KFC' or 'Kentucky Fried Chicken' in the translation.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
When did he give you this cell phone? Except for the cell phone, did the person give you other things?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did he give you this cell phone?'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'this cell phone' in the second part of the question.

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我這支手機除了給我手機之外，他還給了我四百美金作為旅館和膳食的費用
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我這支手機。除了給我手機之外，他還給了我四百美金作為旅館和膳食的費用。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'the day before' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'restaurant bills and meals' in the sentence.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
What is the purpose of giving you this cell phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他說他會透過這支手機連絡我還有來領這高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這支手機連絡我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他說他會透過這支手機連絡我，還有想要領取高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這支手機連絡我。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person who wants to pick up the golf bags will also contact the speaker through the mobile phone.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
That is to say, when you took this cell phone into Taiwan, there would be somebody to get contact with you, meet you, and take this golf bag?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the cultural context

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
是，肯特告訴我會有人跟我聯絡然後來拿這高爾夫球袋
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bag' as '高爾夫球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of '袋子' which means 'bag'.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Then did you know who would get contact with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我不知道誰會打電話給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You also mentioned that except for the cell phone, the person also gave you four hundred US dollars…Is the money monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '酬勞' as 'monetary compensation' which does not accurately convey the meaning of '酬勞'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想說這是給我拿來住旅館和吃飯的錢
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
Therefore, do you mean that besides these four hundred dollars, you will still receive one thousand US dollars when you successfully go back to Thailand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you mean that you will still receive one thousand US dollars when you successfully go back to Thailand, besides these four hundred dollars?'

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
…我是這樣想的 等我把袋子成功地交給對方，再回到泰國之後，我就會收到那一千塊美金
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So in the very beginning when you took this golf bag, did you know that this golf bag has some heroine in it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'golf bag' as '海洛因' which means 'heroin' in Chinese.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不，我完全不知道海洛因在球桿裡面
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The word 'club' in the original text refers to a night club or a venue, but the user translated it as '球桿' which means 'golf club' in Chinese.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think that if you just bring the gold into Taiwan, the monetary compensation is much higher?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道這樣的代價算不算高，我只是想賺一點錢
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Did you ever come into your mind that why the person didn’t want to bring it by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特跟我說他很忙，他需要有人幫他
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'need' should agree with the subject 'he', so it should be 'he needs' instead of 'he need'.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even if there is real gold in the golf bag, you should know that bringing gold into Taiwan maybe illegal, don’t you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '入境' as 'Taiwan' instead of 'the country'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'maybe' after the verb 'illegal' instead of before.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我只知道黃金在曼谷比較便宜，但我真的不知道帶黃金進台灣會是違法的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the user does not know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan, but the user's translation states that they don't know if bringing gold into Taiwan is illegal.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why do you think it won’t be a problem if you bring gold to Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就是只是黃金阿，會有問題嗎? 不是嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
When you took the bag, did you check the things in it?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'you' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation, which affects the clarity and accuracy of the sentence.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
不，我沒有檢察，因為袋子被封起來了我不認為我可以把那個袋子打開
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '檢察' is not the correct translation for 'open'. It means 'inspect' or 'examine'.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
So do you trust the person so much? Don’t you think you might be lied?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '受騙' as 'lied' instead of 'deceived'.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月遇到肯特，我為他工作，我認為我們是伙伴，所以我當然是願意幫他工作他看起來是個好人，我覺得他不會騙我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of 'possibility' as 'we are partners' instead of 'there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我為他工作' where the verb '工作' should agree with the subject '我', resulting in '我為他工作' instead of '我為他工作'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that there was a possibility of becoming work mates later on.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds unnecessary information by stating '我當然是願意幫他工作' which means 'I am willing to work for him, of course' but is not present in the original text.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
Do you mean that the person had showed you that he wanted to work with you so you are willing to help him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
是，我以為我們是一起工作的，所以我才信任他
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '是' (to be) should agree with the subject '我' (I) in number and should be '是' (am) instead of '是' (are).

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
Besides the questions we just asked, do you have further questions?Is there any evidence that you wish the court to investigate for further investigation?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about evidence they want the court to investigate further.

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我對我做的事真的很抱歉我真的不知道袋子裡有什麼東西我當時只知道裡面是黃金，如果我知道裡面是海洛因的話，我絕對不會幫他這個忙，把袋子帶入台灣請原諒我

Besides Kent, do you have more concrete information about the details to help the police find who gives you this bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of a bag in their translation.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我只有他給我的那支手機
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of Kent giving the cell phone.

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
Now you are in detention,…do you have anyone you want the court contact for you?

Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
你可以幫我通知曼谷的家人還有在英國的小孩嗎?他們一定很擔心我，我本來應該要在...12月底回到曼谷的

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of contacting the user's kids in England.

I don’t know a few, maybe.
我不知道欸，有一些吧！

那你知道球桿中藏有毒品嗎？
So do you know there’s some narcotics hidden in your bag?

So who gave you the golf bag? and where?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The name of the guy who gave me the bag was Kent. I met him in Bangkok and he hired me to work for him. I am a computer engineer. He gave me this one ball bag at a KFC in Bangkok.
是一個叫做肯特的男生給我的。我在曼谷遇到他，他請我替他工作。我是個電腦工程師，他在曼谷的一家肯德基給我這個袋子。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'Kent' as '肯特' which is a transliteration of the English name, instead of using a more common Chinese name.

Kent是對方的姓、還是名？這是他的真名嗎？
Is Kent his first name or last name? Is this name really his real name?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.
我認為是他的真名，但我不知道他的姓是什麼。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'real name' as '真名' which means 'true name' instead of '真實姓名' which means 'real full name'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (is) before the subject '他的真名' (his real name) instead of after it.

Where did he give you the bag?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
他讓我在曼谷一間肯德基跟他見面
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'KFC' as '肯德基' which is the Chinese translation of KFC. The user should have used the Thai translation of KFC to maintain the cultural context.

你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
Then why did you help him bring the golf bag to Taiwan?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'him' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the object.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'dollars' as '元' is incorrect. It should be translated as '美元' to specify the currency.

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
So do you mean that you will get 1000 US dollars if you bring the golf bag to Taiwan? Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by changing the meaning of '付' (pay) to 'get'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error by placing 'if you bring the golf bag to Taiwan' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '1000 US dollars'.

對啊，他跟我講說其他事情都不用做，只要帶來台灣就好

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
Is the cell phone you mentioned the one the police detained in the Taoyuan international airport?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '扣案' as 'detained' instead of 'confiscated'.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
是的，是洛基亞的手機
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'Nokia' as '洛基亞' which is a transliteration of the brand name in Chinese. This is an inappropriate cultural transformation as it does not accurately convey the meaning of 'Nokia' in the target language.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
Evidence number 1. Please verify the cell phone the one you mentioned.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
事的就是這支
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不是，這不是我的手機。這是肯特給我的，他把SIM卡插進去之後把手機給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這是肯特給我的，他把SIM卡插進去之後把手機給我。'

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly interpreted the original text, resulting in a mismatched meaning.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對，他在肯德基給我的
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes the specific location '肯德基' (KFC) which is not mentioned in the original text.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
So on what exact date did he give you the cell phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我的，除了手機之外他還給我400塊美金，提供住宿跟飲食。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我的'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'cover restaurant bills and meals' is not accurately translated. It should be translated as '提供住宿跟飲食' instead of '提供住宿跟飲食'.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
What was his intention of giving you this cell phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他說他會透過那支手機跟我聯絡。要來取貨的人也會打這支手機
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他說他會透過這支手機跟我聯絡。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about 'people who want to pick up golf bags'.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
Do you mean that after you arrived in Taiwan, there’s somebody who will call you and meet you up and take the bag away?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the text.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
是的，肯特跟我說會有人在台灣跟我碰面把高爾夫球袋拿走
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'contact me and meet me' as '在台灣跟我碰面' which means 'meet me in Taiwan', but the original text does not mention Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of someone contacting the speaker in their translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the mention of '高爾夫球袋' (golf bag) which is not present in the original text.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know who he or she is?

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
我不知道是誰
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You’ve mentioned that Kent, in addition to giving you the cell phone, also gave you US 400 dollars. Is this kind of reward?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '酬勞' as 'reward' instead of 'payment' or 'compensation'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想那個錢是付我的飯店錢跟餐費
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So in addition to the 400 dollars, after you successfully back to Thailand, then you will get another 1000 US dollars, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
我是這樣理解的，我事成之後我會回到泰國，然後我會得到一千元美金。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying that they will receive another thousand dollars when they bring the bag back to Bangkok, the user's translation states that they will receive one thousand US dollars after they succeed and return to Thailand.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
so did you know that what in this bag is heroine when you accept this …
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '海洛因' as 'heroine' instead of 'heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不!!我完全不知道裡面是海洛因
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user translated 'hidden inside the club' as '裡面是海洛因' which means 'inside is heroin', while the original text states 'heroin was hidden inside the club'.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think that if he only asks you to bring gold to Taiwan, this payment, which is 1000 US dollars, is too high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '代價' as 'payment' instead of 'price'.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道這是不是算高，我只想賺錢
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you ever thought about why Kent doesn’t want to bring it himself?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject 'Kent' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'doesn't' should agree with the singular subject 'Kent', but the user used 'don't' instead.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特跟我說他很忙，這是一種幫他的方式
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'was' should agree with the subject 'Kent', so it should be 'Kent told me he was busy'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the part about Kent wanting someone to help him.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even if it is gold that is hidden in the bag, you should have known that bringing gold into Taiwan may against the law, don’t you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of Taiwan as the specific location.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我想說黃金在泰國比較便宜，但我不知道在台灣是否違法
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions the price of gold in Thailand, while the user's translation talks about the legality of bringing gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why do you have the understanding that…
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就是黃金啊，絕對不會有問題的，不是嗎？

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Did you examine the stuff inside the bag when you got the bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'inside' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
我沒有，因為袋子被封住了。我也不覺得我可以把它打開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有，因為袋子被封住了。' instead of '因為袋子被封住了，我沒有。'

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
Do you really that trust the man? Don’t you feel the possibility of being…
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Missing subject-verb agreement in the question
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Incorrect translation of '受騙' as 'being'

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月遇見肯特，對我來說我們兩個就像是合作的夥伴。他人看起來很好，我不覺得他會騙我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using the phrase '合作的夥伴' which means 'cooperative partner' instead of 'work mates'.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
So do you mean that the man showed some sincerity to make you feel he’s willing to cooperate with you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
沒錯，這就是為什麼我會跟他合作並相信他的原因。

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
In addition to the questions you’ve answered, is there anything you want to add? is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'In addition to the questions you’ve answered' in their translation.

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我很抱歉這一切的發生，我不知道袋子裡面是什麼。他跟我講裡面是黃金，如果我知道是海洛因的話，我就不會帶來台灣了，請原諒我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' which means 'gold', but the original text mentioned 'heroin'.

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
Besides Kent, do you have any more concrete and helpful details to help the police to know who’s the one who asked you to bring the bag to Taiwan?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about bringing the bag to Taiwan.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我只有他給我的手機

I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.
我想這是他真正的名字，但我並不知道他的姓。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'last name' as '姓' which means 'surname' instead of '名字' which means 'name'.

He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
他告訴我，如果我幫他把高爾夫球袋帶到台灣的話，他會給我一千美金，我想賺一點錢，並且我想這是一件容易的事情。

semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of 'one thousand dollars'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of '我想賺一點錢，並且我想這是一件容易的事情' (I want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job)

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
So, you mean that he promised you to give you $1000, and he wanted you to take the bag to Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning.

The cell phone you meant is the one that police confiscated in Taoyuan International Airport?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

Yes, a Nokia phone.
沒錯，那是一隻諾基亞手機。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'Yes, a Nokia phone' as '沒錯，那是一隻諾基亞手機' which means 'Yes, that is a Nokia phone'. The meaning of 'a' is not conveyed in the translation.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
Please show the evidence to the defendant. Defendant, is this cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the evidence being shown to the defendant.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user did not use the correct subject-verb agreement in the question.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
沒錯，這就是肯特先生給我的那隻手機。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation incorrectly states that the phone was given by Mr. Kent, while the original text only mentions that it was given to the user by someone named Kent.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
So, this cell phone is yours?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'this cell phone', so it should be 'is yours' instead of 'is yours?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不，這並不是屬於我的手機，這是肯特先生給我的，他把SIM卡放在裡面並給我這隻手機。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
So, you mean that the cell phone is some gave you, and who is the one gave you the golf bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the original text and confused the person who gave the cell phone with the person who gave the golf bag.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect and does not follow the correct word order.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
沒錯他就是在肯德基的時候給我這隻手機。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes the specific location '肯德基' (KFC), which is not mentioned in the original text.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他告訴我他將會透過這隻手機聯絡我，另外，要來跟我拿高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這隻手機聯絡我。

omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about people wanting to pick up golf bags. The correct translation should include '要來跟我拿高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這隻手機聯絡我'.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
Do you mean that when you take this cell phone into Taiwan, someone will call you and take the golf bag?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of the original text

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
沒錯，肯特先生就是這樣跟我說的，他說有人會跟我見面並跟我拿高爾夫球袋。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'take the bag' as '拿高爾夫球袋' which means 'take the golf bag' instead of 'take the bag'.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know who will contact you?

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我並不知道是誰。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You just said that he gave you $400, and it’s the monetary compensation for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by suggesting that the $400 is the monetary compensation for the interpreter.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想這四百元只是飯店的住宿費用和食宿費。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions 'paying hotel bills and meals', while the user's translation only mentions 'hotel accommodation and meals'. The user's translation omits the word 'paying', which changes the meaning.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So, you mean that, besides the $400, you will get more money after you go back to Thailand?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
那就是我所知道的，我被告知的是，當我把高爾夫球袋給台灣的人時，等我回到泰國，我可以得到1000美元。

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So, do you know there was heroin in this bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不，我並不知道海洛因被藏在高爾夫球杆裡。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user translated 'club' as '高爾夫球杆' (golf club) instead of '俱樂部' (club).

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
 Don’t you feel curious about that the value of taking gold into Taiwan for this monetary compensation is very high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我並沒有想這麼多，我只是額外的想賺點錢。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'if that's too much' from the original text.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Don’t you ever think that why the person didn’t take the bag into Taiwan by himself?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'bag' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'bag' at the end of the sentence instead of the correct position.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特先生告訴我他非常忙碌，他須要有一個人幫他帶袋子到台灣。
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user added the information about carrying bags to Taiwan, which is not mentioned in the original text.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even though you took gold to Taiwan, you might violate the Law in Taiwan, do you know it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道黃金的價格在台灣比較好，但我並不知道這會違法。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why would you think it’s no problem taking gold to Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就只是黃金阿，為什麼會成為一個問題呢?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
When you took the bag, did you examine the bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of checking the contents of the bag.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
不，我沒有檢查過，因為那個袋子是密封的，而且我也不覺得我可以打開那個袋子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有檢查過' instead of '不，我沒有檢查過'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'because' as '因為' is correct, but the word '而且' is not necessary and changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'bag' in the sentence, which is an important detail.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
Don’t you think you might be conned by someone? Why you trust him so much?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by using the word 'conned' instead of 'deceived'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the second sentence, where 'Why you trust him so much?' should be 'Why do you trust him so much?'

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我剛剛說我跟肯特先生是在三月見面，而且我們一起工作過，我想幫助他不是甚麼大問題，我覺得他是一個很好的人阿，我覺得他不會騙我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that they have already worked together, while the original text only mentions the possibility of becoming work mates in the future.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the sentence '我覺得他是一個很好的人阿', where the correct word order should be '我覺得他是一個很好的人'.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
Do you mean that Mr. Kent want to do business with you and cooperate with you? So, you trust him so much?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
沒錯，我覺得我們可以一起合作，那就是為什麼我這麼相信他的原因。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我覺得那就是為什麼我這麼相信他的原因。'

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？

我對於這件事情感到非常抱歉，我不知道袋子裡有甚麼東西，我被告知的是那裡面裝的是黃金，如果我知道裡面是海洛因，我就不會把它帶到台灣，請原諒我好嗎?

你可不可以通知我在曼谷的家人，或是我在英國的小孩呢?我想他們一定很擔心我，我必須在12月的時候回到曼谷。

I only know him as Kent, we met earlier in March 2013.
我只知道對方叫肯特，我只知道我們在2013年3月5號見過
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'earlier in March 2013' as '在2013年3月5號見過', which means 'met on March 5th, 2013', but the original text does not specify a specific date.

Kent是對方的姓、還是名？這是他的真名嗎？

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the question, resulting in a mismatched meaning.

I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.

He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
他跟我說我們約在一家曼谷的肯德基見面

Why did you help him to bring the golf bag to Taiwan?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'you' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'bag' was mistranslated as '球袋' (ball bag) instead of '袋子' (bag).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我想要賺錢阿！而且我覺得這應該是一個簡單的工作' is incorrect. It should be '我想要賺錢！而且我覺得這應該是一個簡單的工作。'

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
Do you mean that he would pay you 1000 US dollar and you only have to bring this golf bag to Taiwan, was that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
The cellphone you said, is that cellphone which police confiscated in the in the Taoyuan International Airport ?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of location

Yes, a Nokia phone.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
Now, please check the evidence 1. Is that cellphone you mentioned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
沒錯，這就是肯特給我的那支手機。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is this cellphone yours?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'this cellphone', so it should be 'Is this cellphone yours?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
這不是我的手機！這是肯特給我的手機！他給我的時候SIM卡就已經裝在裡面了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這是肯特給我的手機' instead of '這不是我的手機'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone before giving it to the speaker.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
Do you mean the cellphone was given by the person who asked you to bring the golf bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using 'given' instead of 'entrusted'.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
沒錯他給我那隻手機，就在肯德基的時候。

omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation also omits the information that the user will be contacted by 'people who want to pick up golf bags'.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the phrase '打給我', which is not present in the original text.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
In other words, when you take this phone in Taiwan, there will somebody to call you and meet up with you to take the golf bag?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that someone will call and meet up to take the golf bag when bringing the phone to Taiwan.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對，肯特告訴我，會有人打這支手機給我，跟我在台灣拿高爾夫球袋。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes unnecessary cultural transformation by mentioning Taiwan and golf bags, which are not present in the original text.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know who will contact with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you know who will contact you?'

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我不知道誰會打給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不知道誰會打給我。'

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
As you said, the person also gave you four hundred US dollars. Was that monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '酬勞' as 'monetary compensation' instead of 'payment' or 'reward'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我認為那400美元只是為了支付我的飯店跟吃的費用吧。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the amount of $400 in their translation.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So, besides the four hundred US dollars, when you successfully go back to Thailand, will you get another one thousand US dollars?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
我認為就是這樣，只要我把高爾夫球袋帶來台灣交給那個人以後在回到泰國，就可以拿到1000美金。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bag' as '高爾夫球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of '行李袋' which means 'luggage bag'.

grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the present tense 'did you know you bring' instead of the past tense 'did you know you brought'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不！！我不知道球棒裡藏了海洛因。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club,' the user's translation says 'No, I didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the baseball bat.'

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think if he just ask you to bring gold in Taiwan, the price, 1000US dollars, is much higher?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '這個代價' as 'the price' instead of 'the cost'.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道價錢算不算高，我只是想賺點小錢。

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？

肯特告訴我他有點忙，他需要有人幫他這個忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '肯特告訴我他需要有人幫他這個忙，他有點忙。'

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even though there is gold in your club, you should know that bringing gold in Taiwan might violate the law, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道金價在泰國比較便宜，但是我不知道攜帶黃金入境有沒有違法。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about Taiwan in their translation.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why don’t you think there is no problem to bring the gold in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation has a double negative, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order should be 'Why do you think there is no problem to bring the gold in Taiwan?'

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就是黃金啊！應該不會有什麼問題，不是嗎？

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
When you take this bag, did you check the thing inside?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you check the things inside when you took the bag?'

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
So, you trust the person so much that you did not think you might be  conned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我3月的時候遇到肯特，那時候我要為他工作，所以你知道我們可能是工作伙伴，所以我就幫他工作。他看起來是一個不錯的人，我不覺得他會騙我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'possibility' as 'you know' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對，我想我跟他一起工作，我們是工作伙伴，所以我才很相信他。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我跟他一起工作' instead of '我想我跟他一起工作'.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
Besides those questions, do you have anything to add? Is there any evidence, which you want the court to investigate for you?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我很抱歉發生了這種事，我不知道有什麼在袋子裡面。他告訴我,袋子裡面的是黃金，如果是海落因的話，我就不會幫他帶袋子了,請你原諒我。

他只有告訴我在曼谷的譯間肯德基見面而已
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'KFC' as '譯間肯德基' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'KFC in Bangkok'.

你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
Why did you want to help him to take this golf bag to taiwan?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is 'you'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'did' instead of 'do' to match the subject 'you'.

He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
當時他告訴我,如果我幫他帶這個高爾夫球帶回台灣,他會給我一千塊美金,我只想賺點錢阿,而且這個工作看起來非常輕鬆
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bag' as '高爾夫球帶' which means 'golf ball carrier' instead of '袋子' which means 'bag'.

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
So as you said, Kent asked you to take this golf bag to Taiwan and the monetary compensation is US 1000, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '付' as 'asked' instead of 'pay'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the condition '代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣' (the condition is to bring this golf bag to Taiwan).

Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
是的,他只有告訴我幫他把這個球袋帶回來台灣,我不需要做任何事情
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the person only needs to bring the golf bag to Taiwan, while the user's translation states that they don't need to do anything.

對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
Was Kent told you that what will going to be when you arrive taiwwan, and who will get into contact with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question

Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
 The telephone you stated, is that the police confiscated in the Taoyuan international airport?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of cultural reference

Yes, a Nokia phone.
 是的,是一支諾基亞的手機
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	諾基亞 (Nokia) 被翻譯成了諾基亞的手機 (Nokia phone)

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
 Then we are going to show you the evidence, is this telephone you mentioned before?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
是的這支就是當時Kent給我的手機
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
And is this cell phone is personal for you….your personally cell phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不,這支不是我的手機,我說了這是Kent給我的手機,而且手機裡面的SIM卡是Kent放進去的,他放進去之後才給我的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我說了這是Kent給我的手機'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '手機裡面的SIM卡是Kent放進去的'.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
Do you mean that the cell phone is given from the one who gave you this golf bag
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by changing the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
事的這就是它在肯德基給我的手機
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '事的' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'he gave me'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the location 'KFC' where the phone was given.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
And when did he give you this? And expect for this cell phone, anything more?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'And except for this cell phone, did he give you anything more?'

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
它在我離開曼谷錢譯天給我這支手機的,除了這支手機,他還給我四百元美金讓我可以在飯店使用
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'the day before' as '離開曼谷錢譯天' is incorrect. It should be translated as '前一天' or '前一天晚上'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'restaurant bills and meals' which is an important detail in the original text.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
What is his purpose for his action of giving you this cell phone?
semantic conversion	omission of details	missing the specific purpose or use of the cell phone

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
Do you mean that after arrive Taiwan, there will a person that will going to contact with you and will pick up the gold bag?

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
是的,Kent說當我到台灣之後那個要跟我拿高爾夫球袋的人會打給我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag' as '那個要跟我拿高爾夫球袋的人會打給我', which means 'the person who wants to take the golf bag from me will call me'. The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know who will get into contact with you?

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不,我真的不知道是誰會打給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
As you said, the person gave you the…beside the cell phone, the person also gave you US 400,is this monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '酬勞' as 'monetary compensation' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我認為那四百元只是我的飯店費用跟我的食宿
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'just' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
 So do you mean that after…beside the US400, after you come back to Thailand, you will get US1000, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
這就是我所知道的全部,以我的認知來說,當我到台灣之後,把這個高爾夫球袋拿個會跟我接洽的人之後,我就可以再回泰國了
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user's translation misinterprets the cultural reference of bringing a bag into Taiwan.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So did you know that when you accept this, in the golf nag is herion?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. 'in the golf nag is herion' does not make sense in English and does not match the original text.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不不不,我真的不知道在那個高爾夫球袋的是海洛因,我是真的真的真的不知道
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user states that they didn't know that heroin was hidden inside a golf bag, which is different from the original text mentioning a club.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think that if he just ask you to broght the gold into Taiwan, this compensation, also US1000, is much higher?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '代價' as 'compensation' instead of 'price'.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道這個代價或是這個價錢有這麼高,我只是想賺點錢而已
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions wanting to make a little extra money, while the user's translation mentions not knowing if the price is too high.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Don’t you think that before that ………………………….why doesn’t that person bring it into Taiwan individually.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific object or item that the person is not bringing.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'bring' before the object, which is incorrect in English.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
Kent告訴我他真的非常忙,希望有人可以協助他
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb '告訴' (told) should come before the object '我' (me).

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even if there is gold in the golf bag, you should know that bring gold into Taiwan is likely to be the violation of law in ROC.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '入境' as 'into Taiwan' instead of 'entering'.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我只知道在泰國黃金蠻便宜的阿,我根本就不知道帶進台灣是違法的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the user only knows that gold is cheaper in Thailand, but the user's translation states that they don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why would you think that it wouldn’t make any problem to bring gold into Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有阿,我沒有檢查,因為當我拿到這個袋子時他是密封起來的,我不認為我有這個權力可以打開他
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
Do you think that you will be conceived, why would you…. trust Kent so much?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
當我在三月遇到Kent的時候我就只是他的員工阿,我只是想為他工作,我就只是想為他工作而已,我認為他是一個非常好的人,我不認為他會欺騙我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that they were already Kent's employee in March, rather than just meeting him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the sentence '當我在三月遇到Kent的時候我就只是他的員工阿' (When I met Kent in March, I was just his employee).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that there was a possibility of becoming work mates with Kent later on.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
Did you mean that Kent expressed that he want to do business with you, so you trust him, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by changing the meaning of the sentence.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
是的,我認為我們將會一起做生意,所以我非常相信他,我認為他會是好搭檔
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我非常相信他' instead of '我認為我們將會一起做生意,所以我非常相信他'.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
Ok, all above …..the statement you sais above, what do you want to add? Do you want to .. do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
對於這一切我真的感到非常的抱歉,我真的不知道在這個袋子裡面有什麼,我只覺得他可能是黃金,不可能是毒品,如果是我的話我真的不會有這種貪念,請你們原諒我

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
So you did you say…the other person agree you to pay you…pay you some compensation and the price…and ask you to take this bag to Taiwan, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits important details from the original text.

Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
對，他告訴我只要把袋子帶進台灣，其他甚麼都不用做。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他告訴我只要把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，其他甚麼都不用做。'

對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
Did he mention what will happen when you arrived Taiwan? I mean, is there anybody will contact you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about who will contact the person in Taiwan.

Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
Kent叫我待在某間指定的旅館，就會有人用他給我的手…就會有人打電話給我，用他給我的手機。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就會有人打電話給我，用他給我的手機。'

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
The cellphone you just mentioned, is that the cellphone which the police had confiscated in Taoyuan International Airport?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '扣案' as 'confiscated' instead of 'seized'.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
對，那是一支Nokia的手機。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '支' is not necessary in this context.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
OK, now please see this evidence number one. So, can you make sure is this cellphone the one you just mentioned?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'please' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation, resulting in a grammatically incorrect sentence.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
對，這支就是Kent給我的手機。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這支手機就是Kent給我的。'

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is this cellphone belongs to you?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'belongs' should agree with the subject 'cellphone', so it should be 'Does this cellphone belong to you?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不是，這支手機不是”我的”。這支手機是Kent給我的。他把SIM卡放進去之後才把這支手機給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這支手機是Kent給我的。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about Kent putting the SIM card into the mobile phone.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
Do you mean this cellphone is given by the one who ask you to being the golf bag into Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text and changes the meaning.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對，他是在肯德基給我這支手機的。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes the specific mention of KFC, which is not present in the original text.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
When is the date did he give you the cellphone? Does anything else did he give you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'other' in the question

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷的前一天給這支手機。除了手機之外，他還給我四百美金來支付旅館和食物的錢。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他在我離開曼谷的前一天給了我這支手機。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the $400 given to cover restaurant bills and meals.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the money being in US dollars.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
So what is the exact purpose or the use of this cellphone that he gave you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他告訴我他會透過這支手機連絡我，而且那個…理論上要來拿這個袋子的人，他也會用這支手機聯絡我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of golf bags in their translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '理論上' (in theory) which is not present in the original text.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
Which means there will someone contact you through this cellphone number, meet you, and take the bag from you…after you get into Taiwan?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the contact and meeting.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the contact and meeting.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對，Kent跟我說會有人跟我聯絡，然後會來拿這個袋子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Kent told me' instead of 'Kent跟我說'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'someone' as '有人' is not accurate. It should be translated as '某人' or '有人' to convey the meaning of an unspecified person.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'to contact me and meet me' which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'to take the bag' which is an important detail in the original text.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
 Did you know who will be you contact?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我完全不知道誰會連絡我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
As you had mentioned earlier, beside the cellphone, the one who give you…the man also gave you four hundred US dollars. Is that…can you count…is that a compensation for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '算是酬勞嗎?' as 'is that a compensation for you?' instead of 'is that considered as a reward?'

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想這筆錢是用來付旅館和我吃…食物的費用。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'just' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '付' (pay) before the noun '旅館' (hotel), which is incorrect in Chinese.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'my' before 'hotel bills', which changes the possessive meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'and' between 'hotel bills' and 'meals', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So…besides this four hundred US dollars, after you success…after you finished you job and get back to Thailand, will you receive another one thousand US dollars?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
對，我想應該是這樣子沒有錯。等我把袋子成功交給對方，然後在回代泰國之後，我就會再收到另外一千美金。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and coming back to Bangkok to receive another thousand dollars, while the user's translation talks about successfully handing over the bag to someone and receiving another thousand dollars after returning to Thailand.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So when the very beginning…when you take…took this job, do you understand…do you know that the thing you are carrying is heroine?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '海洛因' as 'heroine'

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不不不…我完全…完全不知道在球袋裡面藏的是海洛因。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Well…do you think the cost...if just bringing gold into Taiwan, this price, which means one thousand dollars, a little bit too high for this job
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the specific amount of money (1000 US dollars).

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我真的不知道這個代價是不是真的太高。但我就只是想賺點零用錢嘛。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I just want to make a little extra money,' the user's translation says 'I really don't know if the price is really too high.'

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Did it ever cross your mind why the person don’t want to bring the thing by them…by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
Kent跟我說他很忙，就需要有人來幫他這個忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Kent told me' instead of 'Kent跟我說'.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Well…even if there is real gold in the golf bag, you should…you should know it might be illegal to bring gold into Taiwan, isn’t it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道黃金在泰國是比較便宜，但我真的不知道帶黃金入境是不是在台灣是算是違法的事情。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the user knows gold is cheaper in Thailand, but does not know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan. However, the user's translation states that they don't know if bringing gold into Taiwan is illegal, without mentioning their knowledge about gold being cheaper in Thailand.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why did you think it won’t be a problem to bring gold into Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金不就是黃金嘛，應該不會是甚麼大問題，不是嗎
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
When you bringing the bag, did you ever exam the thing inside it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有，我沒有檢查，因為袋子被封起來了。我覺得我可能不太應該把袋子打開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有檢查，因為袋子被封起來了。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'I don't think I can open a bag' is incorrect. It should be translated as '我不認為我能打開袋子'.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
So you were just that trust the other person? Don’t you ever thought the possibility of being de…deceived
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我和Kent在三月認識的時候，我本來是要幫他工作的，我就是有可能成為夥伴阿，所以我是可以…我當然願意幫他工作。他看起來人很好啊，是個好人，我沒有想過他會騙我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我就是有可能成為夥伴阿' is incorrect. It should be '我有可能就是成為他的夥伴。'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '他看起來人很好啊'. It should be '他看起來很好啊'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我沒有想過他會騙我' is a mismatched meaning. It should be '我相信他不會騙我'.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
So do you mean the other person have…have indicated the work relationship with you, so you don’t ever doubt him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對，我覺得…我以為我們會一起工作，這就是我這麼信任他的原因。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為我們會一起工作，這就是我這麼信任他的原因。'

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
OK. So, beside the questions you just being asked, is there anything you want to add? Is there any evidence you wish the court will investigate…will make a further investigation?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'make' in the phrase 'make a further investigation'

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我真的很抱歉發生這樣的事情，我真的不知道袋子裡裝的是甚麼。他告訴我袋子裡的是黃金，如果我知道裡面是海洛英的話，我是絕對不會把袋子帶進台灣來的。請原諒我。

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
Besides Kent, do you have any…Do you have more concrete information to help the police to track who is your…er…ask you help?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'more' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我只有那支他給我的手機。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只有那支他給我的手機。'

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
So far, you are detained. Is there anyone you want…you want us to inform for you… to contact for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
可以請你們幫我聯絡我在曼谷的家人，或者是在英國我的小孩嗎？他們應該蠻擔心我，因為我本來是回…因為我本來預計在十二月底回曼谷的。

So why do you take the golf bag to Taiwan for him?

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning.

Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
式的，他告訴我只要把袋子帶到台灣就好了，其他什麼都不用做
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '只要把袋子帶到台灣就好了，其他什麼都不用做。'

對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
Did he tell you that when you arrived Taiwan what will happen? I mean will somebody connect with you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '接洽' as 'connect with' instead of 'contact'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'connect' before the subject 'somebody', resulting in incorrect word order

Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
肯特跟我說只要待在旅館裡面，靜靜等著會有人打電話給我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. 'Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.' is translated as '肯特跟我說只要待在旅館裡面，靜靜等著會有人打電話給我', which means 'Kent told me to stay inside the hotel and wait quietly for someone to call me.' The user omits the information about the hotel being designated and changes the meaning of 'stay at' to 'stay inside'.

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
The cell phone you just mentioned, is the one the police take from you from the Taoyuan National Airport.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '扣案' as 'take from you' instead of 'confiscate'.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
是的，他是一隻諾基亞的手機。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' (he) is used instead of '一隻' (a) to describe the Nokia phone.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
I am going to show you the phone. Please check it is that the cell phone you bring that you mentioned.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
是的，這就是肯特給我的手機
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the cell phone was given by Kent, but the user's translation suggests that the cell phone belongs to Kent.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is the cell phone your personal phone
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Is this cell phone your personal phone?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不，他並非我個人的手機，這支手機是肯特給我的，他將SIM卡放入後才給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這支手機是肯特給我的'.
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after '這支手機'. The correct sentence should be '這支手機，是肯特給我的'.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
So you mean the cell phone is the person who ask you to bring the golf bag to Taiwan gave you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
是的，他在肯德基將這支手機交給我
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'KFC' as '肯德基' which is the Chinese translation of the fast food restaurant. It should be kept as 'KFC' since it is a well-known brand name.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
Then when did he gave you the cell phone and what else did he give you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我那支手機。除了手機之外他給我400美元作為餐費還有旅館的費用
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我那支手機。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'restaurant bills and meals' in the sentence.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
So what exact is his purpose to give you this cell phone?
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of the word 'exact'

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他說他會透過這支手機跟我聯繫，而且那個要跟我拿球袋的人會打這支電話給我跟我聯絡
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '打' (call) should come before the object '這支電話' (this mobile phone).

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
That is to say, when you arrived Taiwan, someone will call you through this cell phone and take the golf bag from you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text, resulting in a mismatched meaning.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對的，肯特告訴我當我到了台灣會有人打這支電話給我跟我拿高爾夫球袋
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying that someone will contact and meet the user to take the bag, the user's translation mentions someone calling and taking a golf bag.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know who will contact into you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我不知道誰會打給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
As you mentioned, the person who gave you the golf bag also gave you 400 US dollars, is it a kind of monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the original text, changing the context from receiving a golf bag to receiving money.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想那筆錢只是用來支付我的餐費還有旅館的費用而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'just' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So except the 400 US dollars, you mean after you go back to Bangkok, you get another 100 dollars? Rather, 1000 dollars.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '1000美金' as '100 dollars' instead of '1000 dollars'.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
我是這麼想的，我的理解是當我順利的將高爾夫球袋拿到台灣並且順利地交給那個人之後，回到泰國我可以拿到我的酬勞
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and getting another thousand dollars when coming back to Bangkok, while the user's translation mentions bringing a golf bag to Taiwan and receiving a reward.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So do you know what you broght to Taiwan is heroine
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'heroin' as 'heroine', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不，我根本不知道海洛因藏在球桿裡面
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the heroin was hidden inside the club, but the user's translation mentions that the heroin was hidden inside a pool cue (球桿).

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think if you just bring the gold to Taiwan, the monetary compensation for gold is too high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我沒有特別去思考報酬是不是過高，我只是想賺錢而已
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Then have you think of that what did the person bring his bag to Taiwan by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特跟我說他太忙碌了，所以需要一個人幫他帶過來
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '肯特跟我說他太忙碌了，所以需要一個人幫他。'

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Well, even if it is gold in the golf bag, you should know that bringing the golf to Taiwan may be violet the law, isn’t it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'golf' was mistranslated as 'gold'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'violet' should be 'violate' to match the subject 'bringing'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'bringing the gold to Taiwan' in the translation.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我想說黃金在泰國沒有很值錢，我沒有想過帶來台灣會是違法的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that gold is cheaper in Thailand, while the user's translation states that gold is not valuable in Thailand.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
What do you think bringing to Taiwan isn’t a problem?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金不就是黃金而已嗎? 會構成什麼大問題呢?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Have you checked what is inside the golf bag when you took it?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user added the word 'golf' which is not mentioned in the original text.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有ㄟ我沒有檢查，因為袋子是密封的，我不覺得我可以擅自打開他
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有檢查，因為袋子是密封的，我不覺得我可以擅自打開他。'

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
So you just easy trust the person and never thought you might be conned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在3月的時候讓是肯特的，你知道當時我準備跟他合作經營公司，所以我想我應該可以幫助他，他看起來是個好人，我不覺得他會騙我
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '讓' should be '遇到' to convey the meaning of 'met'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '讓是肯特的' is incorrect. It should be '我在3月的時候遇到了肯特'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that there was a possibility of becoming work mates.

omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds the phrase '我不覺得他會騙我' which is not present in the original text.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
So you men Kent want to cooperate with you to run a business so you think there is no problem with him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對啊我想說我們會一起合作，所以就不疑有他
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
OK, beside what you have mentioned before, do you have anything else to say? Is there and evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'Is there' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

我對於發生的一切感到很抱歉，我真的不知道袋子裡面裝了什麼，我當時真的以為袋子裡面裝的是黃金，如果我知道他是海洛因的話，我絕對不會貪心到把它帶來台灣的，請原諒我

他叫我待在一間旅館裡面，然後他有給我一隻電話，然後說有人會打給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他叫我待在一間旅館裡面，然後他給了我一隻電話，然後說有人會打給我。'

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
 Is the cell phone you’re talking about the one which I confiscated in Taoyuan International Airport?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '扣案' as 'confiscated' instead of 'seized'.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
對，是Nokia的手機。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '對' is not the correct translation for 'Yes'.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
So please look at this page, and is the cell phone the one you were talking about?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the page where the cell phone is located.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
對，這就是Kent給我的那隻手機。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation incorrectly states that Kent gave the phone to the user, while the original text states that the phone was given by Kent to someone else.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is this your own cell phone?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'this', so it should be 'Is this your own cell phone?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不是，這不是我的啦。這隻手機是Kent的，他把sim卡放到手機來，然後給我的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這隻手機是Kent給我的'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
 You mean that this cell phone was from the person who gave you the golf bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對，他是在肯德基給我的。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes the specific mention of the restaurant '肯德基' (KFC), which is not present in the original text.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
On which day did he give it to you? In addition to that phone, what else did he give you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'On which day did he give it to you?'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'that phone' in the translation.

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他是在我離開曼谷的前一天給我的。除此之外，他還給了我四百塊，是要付旅館的費用還有食物….食物的費用。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他是在我離開曼谷的前一天給我的。' instead of '他是在我離開曼谷的前一天給我的。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation of 'restaurant bills and meals' as '旅館的費用還有食物' is incorrect. The correct translation should be '餐廳的費用和餐飲費用'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of a cell phone being given. The correct translation should include '除此之外，他還給了我一部手機'.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
What is the purpose of this cell phone he gave you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他說他用這隻手機聯絡我。還有就是要跟我拿高爾夫球帶的人會打到這隻手機…會用這隻手機聯絡我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他說他會用這隻手機聯絡我。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part 'In addition' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part 'people who want to pick up golf bags' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part 'will also contact me through this mobile phone' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
So you mean that after you bring this cell phone into Taiwan, someone will call you and meet you to take the golf bag away?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the original text and misinterpreted the purpose of the phone and the golf bag.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對，Kent跟我說我抵達台灣後會有人打電話給我，要拿這個高爾夫球袋。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag' as '要拿這個高爾夫球袋' which means 'to take this golf bag'. The meaning of 'take the bag' is not accurately conveyed.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
So do you know who that person will be? The person who will contact you.

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
我不知道是誰耶。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I don't know who's going to call me,' the user's translation says 'I don't know who it is.'

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You said that in addition to this cell phone, that person also gave you 400 US dollars, is that your pay or something else?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '酬勞' as 'pay' instead of 'reward'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我覺得那應該是我飯店和吃飯的費用吧。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. 'Paying my hotel bills and meals' is not the same as '我飯店和吃飯的費用'.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
 So after you…in addition to this 400 US dollars, after you successfully get back to Bangkok…get back to Thailand, you will get another 100 US dollars?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
我是這樣理解的。就是我把東西拿到台灣之後，回到泰國，我就會收到1000塊美金。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'thousand dollars' as '1000塊美金', which is incorrect. The correct translation should be '1000美元'.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So did you know that you were trafficking heroine when that person ask you to do that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '帶的是海洛因' as 'trafficking heroine', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
我完全不知道球竿裡面是海洛因。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
 Well, don’t you think that if that person is simply asking you to bring gold to Taiwan, this price, 1000 US dollars, is a bit high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '代價' as 'price' instead of 'cost'.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道這個價格算不算高，我只是要一點…就是只是想賺錢而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Did you think about why that person…was not willing to bring that by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
Kent是跟我說他很忙，需要人家幫忙。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '需要' (need) should agree with the subject 'Kent', so it should be '需要人幫忙' instead of '需要人家幫忙'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that Kent wanted someone to help him. It should be '需要有人幫忙' instead of '需要人幫忙'.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even if…in the…there is…even if you know that it is gold in the golf bag, you should know that bringing gold into Taiwan may be against the law…isn’t that true?...Is that true?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of Taiwan as the specific location.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道黃金在泰國是比較便宜，但我沒有想過說帶進台灣是不是違法的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why do you think that there will be no problem if you bring gold into Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就是黃金啊，應該沒有什麼問題吧。

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
When you get…got the bag, did you take a look at what is inside?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'got' in the translation, which changes the tense and meaning of the sentence.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有啊，因為包包就是被封起來的。我覺得我不應該把它打開
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
 So you…you believe that person, you didn’t think that you might be cheated?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我是在三月的時候遇到Kent的，他那個時候就僱用我，我就覺得我們是合作夥伴啊，我覺得我們可以合作這樣。他看起來人很好，我不覺得他會騙我啊。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of 'there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the sentence '他那個時候就僱用我' (He hired me at that time).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the possibility of becoming work mates was present when they met in March.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
You said that that person was willing to work with you, so you didn’t doubt anything?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對啊，我覺得我們應該是合作夥伴，所以我就相信他了。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'so that's why I trust him so much' is translated as '我覺得我們應該是合作夥伴，所以我就相信他了' which means 'I think we should be partners, so I trust him.' The user's translation does not capture the idea of trust being based on a reason or justification.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
OK, so in addition to what you have just said, what…do you want to say anything else? Anything to add? Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'OK, so' at the beginning of the sentence.

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我真的很抱歉發生了這樣的事情，我真的不知道裡面放的是什麼。我真的以為是黃金，如果我知道是海洛因的話，我絕對不會因為那個前把它帶到台灣。拜託原諒我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' (yellow gold), but the original text mentioned 'hidden' which implies something illegal. The correct translation for 'gold' in this context would be '黃金' (gold) or '金塊' (gold bars).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the bag being hidden, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the bag containing heroin, which is a crucial detail in the original text.

semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

Yes, a Nokia phone.
對。這是一隻Nokia 手機。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '隻' is not appropriate for a phone, it is used for counting animals or certain objects.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
So please check the evidence. Here is the evidence checked in the case. Please verify is it the cell phone you mentioned before?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the evidence being checked in the case.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
對這就是那隻kent給我的手機。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '對' is used incorrectly instead of '這'.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is this cell phone belonging to your self ?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'belonging' should be in the form of 'belongs' to match the subject 'this cell phone'.

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不這不是我的手機。這支手機是kent 給我的。 他把sim卡放進去然後給了我這隻手機。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這不是我的手機。'

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
You mean the cell phone is the person who ask you to bring the golf bag to Taiwan and he gave you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對是的 。他在肯德基給我這隻手機。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. 'KFC' is translated as '肯德基' which is the correct translation, but the phrase '在肯德基給我這隻手機' means 'gave me this phone at KFC' instead of 'gave me this phone in KFC'.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
Then on what date did he give you the cell phone? Except for the cell phone, did he give you another thing?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷前一天給我手機。 除了手機之外 它給我400塊美金是為了支付旅館和食物的費用。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他在我離開曼谷前一天給我手機。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'restaurant bills' as '旅館和食物的費用' which means 'hotel and food expenses'. The correct translation should be '餐廳帳單'.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
So what’s the purpose or use he gave you the cell phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他跟我說他會用這隻手機和我連絡。然後應該要拿這高爾夫球袋的人也會用這支手機和我連絡。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他跟我說他會用這支手機和我連絡。'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '手機' should be translated as 'mobile phone' instead of 'cell phone'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the person will contact the user through the mobile phone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact the user through the mobile phone.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
That is to say when you take the phone and arrive Taiwan, there will be someone call you and meet you for the golf bag?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation misinterprets the cultural context and transforms the original meaning.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對kent告訴我當我到達台灣之後會有人和我連絡來拿這高爾夫球袋。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying that someone will contact and meet the user to take the bag, the user's translation mentions that someone will contact the user after they arrive in Taiwan to take the golf bag.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know the person that is going to contact you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不 我不知道誰會打給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You also mentioned that except your cell phone, the person also gave you us 400 dollars, is that a monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '酬勞' as 'monetary compensation' instead of 'reward' or 'payment'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想這錢是為了讓我付旅館和食物的錢。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals,' the user's translation says 'I think this money is for me to pay for hotel and food.'

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So you mean except for the 400 US dollar, when you successfully go back to Thailand, you will get another 1000 us dollars. Do you mean that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the original meaning of the sentence.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
這些是我理解的部分。當我成功把高爾夫袋給哪個人之後我會回到泰國，領那1000塊美金。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and coming back to Bangkok to receive another thousand dollars, while the user's translation mentions giving a golf bag to someone and returning to Thailand to receive the money.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So when you say yes to this work, do you mean you know you are bringing heroine?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '海洛因' as 'heroine' instead of 'heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不 我根本不知道海洛因被藏在球桿裡
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that heroin was hidden inside the club, but the user's translation mentions that heroin was hidden inside a pool cue (球桿).

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
 Don’t you think if it is a case that ask you to bring gold to Taiwan, the price, same as 1000 us dollars, is too high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '這個代價' as 'the price' instead of 'the cost'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user places 'same as 1000 us dollars' in the wrong position in the sentence.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道代價是不是很高。 我只是想賺一些外快。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'too much' as '代價是不是很高' which means 'the cost is high' instead of '太多' which means 'too much'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'just' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you ever thought that why that person just bring it by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
kent 告訴我他很忙。他需要一個人來幫他。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Kent told me he was busy. He wanted someone to help him.'

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even though there is gold in the golf bag, you should know bringing gold to Taiwan may be a violation to the law, isn’t it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '高爾夫球袋' as 'golf bag' instead of 'golf club bag'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'bringing' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan as the destination country.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user did not consider the cultural context of bringing gold into Taiwan, which may have legal implications.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道黃金在泰國比較便宜。但我不知道帶黃金入境到台灣來有可能是違法的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
 Why don’t you think it is ok to bring gold to Taiwan ?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就是黃金。它應該不會造成太多的問題吧。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Did you examine the golf bag when you take it?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'inside' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
不 我沒有 因為那袋子是密封的。封起來了我想我不應該把它打開來看。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不 我沒有' instead of '我沒有 不'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'because' as '因為' is correct, but the meaning of the sentence is not accurately conveyed. The original sentence implies that the speaker cannot open the bag, while the translation suggests that the speaker should not open the bag.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
 You trust him so much don’t you think you may be coned?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月時候認識了kent 我們可能成為夥伴。所以你知道的他似乎是個好人。我不認為他會騙我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我在三月時候認識了kent' is incorrect. It should be '我在三月時候認識了Kent'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我們可能成為夥伴' is translated as 'we might become partners' instead of 'there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on'. The meaning is not accurately conveyed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the possibility of becoming work mates was mentioned when the user met Kent in March.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the information that the user thinks they can work for Kent because he is a good guy and won't lie.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
 Do you mean that the person mentioned that he want you to be his business partner so you never have a question, you never question him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對我以為我們會一起工作所以我相信他。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text expresses trust in someone, while the user's translation mentions working together.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
Ok so except for the questions you have answered, is there anything that you want to add? Any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'you have' in the sentence 'is there anything that you want to add?'

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我對發生的事感到很抱歉。我不知道袋子裡裝得是什麼。我被告知這袋子裡裝得是黃金 。如果我知道是海洛因 。我絕對不會同意把袋子帶到台灣來。請原諒我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' (gold), but the original text mentioned 'heroin'.

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
Besides Kent, do you have any more concrete information that may help the police to investigate the person that ask you to do this work?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about providing more specific details that could help the police in their investigation.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我只有他給我那隻手機。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me,' the user's translation says 'I only have the phone he gave me.' The user's translation omits the word 'all' and changes the word order, resulting in a different meaning.

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
Now you are in detention, is any person that you want we to notify for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
你可以連絡我在泰國的家人或是我在英國的小孩嗎? 他們一定很擔心我。我在12月底的時候本來應該回到曼谷的。

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.

下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。
Next court is for trail procedure; you have a right to a lawyerWhen you decide the lawyer, you can have a meeting with the lawyer and he or she will understand the case, do you understand? If it is necessary, the lawyer may help you to contact with your family. Do you understand?

檢察官有沒有需要進一步調查的證據？

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did he give you anything else besides the cellphone?'

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我手機的。除此之外，他給我了400塊美金，是為了飯店的錢，還有….食物的錢。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我手機。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'restaurant bills' and 'meals' as '飯店的錢' and '食物的錢' respectively is incorrect. The correct translation should be '餐廳的帳單' and '餐飲費用'.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
So what is the purpose of him giving you the cellphone?
semantic conversion	omission of details	missing the specific purpose or use of the cellphone

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他跟我說他會透過這隻手機和我聯絡。還有會…會到台灣和我領這個包包的人會透過這隻手機聯絡我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'pick up' as '領' is incorrect. It should be translated as '取走' or '接取'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'golf bags' in the second part of the sentence.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
Which means, when you arrive in Taiwan with this cellphone, somebody will call you through this phone and meet with you to receive the golf bag?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly interpreted the original text and added unnecessary content by mentioning someone calling and meeting to receive a golf bag.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
是。Kent有跟我說有人會在我抵達台灣之後聯絡我，和我領取這個包包。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag', the user's translation says 'someone will contact me after I arrive in Taiwan and I will receive the bag'.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
So do you know who will get into contact with you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我不知道誰會打給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不知道誰會打給我。'

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
…You mentioned 400 dollars and the cellphone. Does this count as the monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想，那四百塊應該是我飯店跟伙食的支出。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So, besides that 400 US dollars, you will receive more money once you get back to Thailand successfully?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '400元' as '400 US dollars' instead of '400 yuan'.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
我是這麼以為的。在我到台灣交付這個高爾夫球袋之後，就可以回到泰國，然後領取那1000塊美金。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of bringing a golf bag into Taiwan.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So when you accepted this offer, you knew what you were bringing was heroine?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'heroine' is a female hero, not the drug 'heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不不，我完全沒有想到球桿裡面會藏有海洛因。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I really didn't know', the user's translation says 'I completely didn't think'.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think that to bring gold into Taiwan, 1000 dollars, this is a bit high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '代價' as 'dollars' instead of 'price'.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道這樣的價格是不是太高，我只是想要賺更多錢。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只是想要賺更多錢，我不知道這樣的價格是不是太高。'

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Haven’t you ever questioned why he didn’t bring it himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
Kent和我說他太忙了，而需要人來幫助他。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '說' (said) should agree with the subject 'Kent', so it should be 'Kent說' instead of 'Kent和我說'.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even if in the golf bag, it was gold, you should know that bringing gold into the country could be against the law, isn’t that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the sentence is not accurately conveyed.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道在泰國黃金的價錢會更便宜，但我不知道帶到台灣這是違法..或是不違法。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the price of gold is cheaper in Thailand, but the user's translation states that the price of gold in Thailand is cheaper.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of not knowing whether it is illegal or not to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why did you think that bringing gold would be okay
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就只是黃金吧，他並不會造成什麼大問題的啊
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
When you were carrying the golf bag, did you check what it held inside?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific item being carried in the bag.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
我沒有，因為袋子被封起來了。我不覺得我可以打開它。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'open' should come before the object 'a bag'.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
You have that much faith in him, you don’t think you were being conned?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月的時候認識Kent，而那時候我覺得可以為他工作，或成為夥伴你知道嗎..或著是為他工作。他感覺像是一個好人，感覺不會騙我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'work mates' as '夥伴' which means 'partners' instead of '同事' which means 'colleagues'.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
So you thought he wanted to work with you as business partners, so you didn’t question him at all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對，我以為我們會一起工作。這也是為什麼我會這麼信任他。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這也是為什麼我這麼信任他。'

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我對此感到很抱歉，我不知道袋子裡面裝了什麼東西。我以為裡面是黃金，要是有人和我說裡面是海洛因的話，我絕對不會答應要帶到台灣的。請原諒我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'hidden' as '裝了' which means 'packed' instead of '藏了' which means 'hidden'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' which means 'gold' instead of '金子' which means 'gold'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'heroin' as '海洛因' which means 'heroin' instead of '海洛因' which also means 'heroin'.

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
Besides Kent, do you have any more concrete information to help the police to find who the person who… asked to bring the bag is?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about someone asking to bring the bag.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我就只有他給我的那隻手機。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'All I have is the cell phone' is translated as '我就只有他給我的那隻手機', which means 'I only have the phone he gave me.' The user's translation does not include the word 'Kent' and does not convey the possessive relationship between Kent and the cell phone.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'in England' when referring to the location of their kids.

下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。

那你知道球桿中藏有毒品嗎？

他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？
Where did he hand you the golf bag?

He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
他告訴我在一個曼谷的肯德基會面。

Then why did you want to help him to bring the golf bag to Taiwan?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'him' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

是的。他告訴我只要幫他把高爾夫球袋帶到台灣就好，其他事都不用做。

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me,' the user's translation says 'Yes, it is that mobile phone.'

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is this your own cell phone?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'this', so it should be 'Is this your own cell phone?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不是。這是坎特給我的阿，他把SIM卡插進去，然後就給我了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這是坎特給我的阿'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the phone is a mobile phone. The correct translation should include '這是坎特給我的手機'.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對，他在肯德基給我的。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes the specific mention of the restaurant '肯德基' (KFC), which is not present in the original text.

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我手機。除了手機以外，他還給我四百美金，讓我住飯店，提供食宿費。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我手機。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'cover restaurant bills and meals' as '讓我住飯店，提供食宿費' is incorrect. It should be translated as '支付餐廳費用和餐飲費用'.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
Then what is the main purpose of him handling the phone to you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the original meaning.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他告訴我他能透過這支手機與我聯絡。還有，要拿這個高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這支電話打給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '他告訴我能透過這支手機與我聯絡。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'people who want to pick up golf bags'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'will also contact me through this mobile phone'.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
Okay, so do you mean that after you brought this cell phone to Taiwan, someone will contact you and ask you to hand him the golf bag?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of the original text

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對，坎特告訴我，會有人打電話給我，到達台灣之後。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'meet me to take the bag' as '到達台灣之後' which means 'after arriving in Taiwan', completely changing the meaning of the sentence.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Then, do you know who will be your contact?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不知道，完全不知道誰會打給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不知道誰會打給我' instead of '不知道，完全不知道誰會打給我。'

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You’ve just said that besides giving you the cell phone, he actually gave you USD 400, does this mean a monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '酬勞' as 'monetary compensation' instead of 'reward'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我覺得那是我的飯店食宿費阿。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. 'Paying my hotel bills and meals' is not the same as '我的飯店食宿費' (my hotel accommodation and meals expenses).

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So, in addition to this USD 400, if you successfully returned to Thailand, he will still hand you the rest of the money?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the word '拿到' as 'hand' instead of 'get/receive'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'he' before the verb 'will', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
據我所知，對。我在台灣給了那個人高爾夫球袋以後，我將會回到泰國，然後就會拿到1000元美金了。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and getting another thousand dollars when returning to Bangkok, while the user's translation talks about giving a golf bag to someone in Taiwan and receiving 1000 US dollars.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So the time you accepted this offer, did you know that the bag was filled with heroin?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
噢，完全不知道，完全不知道海洛因會藏在球竿裡面。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes a cultural transformation by replacing 'club' with '球竿' which means 'golf club' instead of 'nightclub'.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Didn’t you think that if it were just gold, then the USD 1000 monetary compensation would be a little bit too high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '代價' as 'monetary compensation' instead of 'price'.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我並不知道這樣算很高阿，我只是想要賺點錢而已。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Didn’t you ever wonder that why that person won’t bring that thing by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
坎特告訴我他很忙，所以需要有人幫他帶阿。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '坎特告訴我他很忙，所以需要有人幫他。'

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even if it were gold in the golf bag, you should’ve had the clear idea that bringing gold to our country is against the law.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning by using 'should’ve had the clear idea' instead of 'should know'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order by placing 'the clear idea' before 'should’ve had'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the possibility of it being illegal to bring gold into the country.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我是知道泰國的黃金比較便宜啦，我並不知道帶黃金入境會違法。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the user knows that gold is cheaper in Thailand, but does not know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan. However, the user's translation suggests that they do not know if it is illegal to bring gold into Thailand.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why would you think that it isn’t against the law?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
就只是黃金而已阿，有甚麼問題阿?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
When you got the bag, did you examine the things in the bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of checking the contents of the bag.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有，因為那個袋子就被扣得緊緊的了。而且我覺得打開它並不適當。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為那個袋子被扣得緊緊的了，所以我覺得打開它並不適當。'

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
Why did you trust that person so easily? Weren’t you afraid of being conned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The subject 'you' should come before the verb 'did'.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月的時候，遇到了坎特阿，我要跟他一起工作，所以我們會變同事。他看來人很好阿，不像是會騙我的人。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'possibility' as '會變同事' which means 'will become colleagues' instead of '有可能成為同事' which means 'there was a possibility of becoming colleagues'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '在三月的時候' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject '我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the possibility of becoming work mates was in the past when they met in March.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
Do you mean to say that that person wished to collaborate with you, so you just trusted him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
是，我認為我們以後會變同事，一起工作，所以我就信任他了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我就信任他了' instead of '我就信任他了所以'.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
 Okay, so after these questions, do you have anything to add? Is there any evidence the court wishes to further investigate?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我為我的行為感到非常抱歉。我不知道袋子裡有甚麼東西。對方就告訴我裡面是黃金，如果我知道裡面是海洛因，我才不會幫助他帶回台灣呢。請原諒我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' (yellow gold), but the original text mentioned 'heroin'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'I don't know what was hidden in the bag' in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'if I knew it was heroin' in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan' in their translation.

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
In addition to Kent, do you have any further evidence of who asked you to bring the golf bag to Taiwan?

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我只有他給我的那支手機。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只有那支他給我的手機。'

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
Now you’re being detained, do you have any person that you need to inform?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'we' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'being detained' before the subject 'you', which is incorrect in English.

Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
你可以幫我通知我在泰國的家人或是在英國的朋友嗎?他一定擔心死了，因為我在12底的時候，會再回泰國呢。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '朋友' (friends) is used instead of '孩子' (kids) to refer to the user's children in England.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of contacting their family in Bangkok.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user's worry about their family and kids.

下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。
Next time will be the trial procedure, and you have the right to a lawyer, and the lawyer will meet you to understand the case, do you understand? If it is necessary, the lawyer can also help you contact your family. Is it clear?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the original meaning.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
That is to say, did you say that after you arrived at Taiwan, there is a person that will call you and will meet up with you for this bag?

我認為那是我支付飯店以及伙食的款項。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions 'just paying my hotel bills and meals', while the user's translation includes '支付飯店以及伙食的款項' which means 'paying for hotel and meals'. The user's translation implies that the payment is for the hotel and meals themselves, rather than the user paying for them.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
Do you mean that after you arrive at Thailand, you will further get 1,000 US dollars in addition to this 400 hundred dollars?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
我是這麼認為的。在我把高爾夫球袋帶去台灣之後，我會回泰國，就可拿到那1,000元美金。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'thousand dollars' as '1,000元美金' which means '1,000 US dollars' instead of '1,000 dollars'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在我把高爾夫球袋帶去台灣之後' (after I bring the golf bag to Taiwan) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb '回泰國' (return to Thailand).

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So, did you mean that you have known the bag contained heroin before you get the case?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不，我不知道裡面有海洛因。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user's translation states 'I didn't know there was heroin inside', while the original text states 'No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.' The user's translation omits the word 'hidden' and does not convey the sense of surprise or discovery in the original text.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you know that the paying in Taiwan for bringing gold is very high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道那代價是否太高，我只是想賺點外快。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'make a little extra money' is translated as '賺點外快', which does not capture the idea of wanting to make money on the side.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you ever thought that the reason that the person did not bring the bag by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
特有跟我說過他很忙，他需要有個人幫她。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'help' should agree with the subject 'him', not 'her'.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even though you knew that there was gold in the bag, did you know that bring gold is the violation against the law in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that bringing gold is a violation against the law in Taiwan, while the original text only suggests that it could be illegal.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道在泰國黃金比較便宜，但我不知道把黃金帶到台灣是否違法。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the user knows that gold is cheaper in Thailand, but does not know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan. However, the user's translation suggests that they know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, but they do not know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why did you think that bring gold into Taiwan will not constitute the violation of law?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就是黃金，應該不會造成什麼問題。

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
不，我沒有去檢查，因為這個高爾夫球袋是封著的。我認為我不太恰當去打開他
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'open' should come before the object 'a bag'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'I don't think I can open a bag' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence 'I don't think I can open a bag'.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
You just trusted the person. And, are you not afraid of being conned?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
就像我前面說的，我在3月時見過他，我認為他是我的工作夥伴。他似乎是個不錯的人，我覺得他不會騙我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'work mates' as '工作夥伴' which means 'work partners' instead of '同事' which means 'colleagues'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time reference '在3月時' (in March) after the verb '見過' (met), which is incorrect. It should be '我在3月時見過他' (I met him in March).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the possibility of becoming work mates in the future, which was mentioned in the original text.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對，我認為我們是可以一起合作的，所以我相信他。

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
So, beside the statements you have made before, did you want to add anything? Is there any evidence that you hope to ask the court to investigate for you?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我對這件事情真的感到很抱歉。我不知道在那個包包裡面的是什麼。我不知道在裡面的不是黃金，如果是海洛因，我就不會引起貪念把這個高爾夫球袋帶來台灣。請原諒我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' (gold), but it should be '金子' (gold).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed '高爾夫球袋' (golf bag) at the end of the sentence instead of after '這個' (this).

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這是肯特給我的，他把sim卡放到手機'.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
So you mean that this cell phone was given by the person who gave you this bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
是的，他在肯德基給我這隻手機
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. 'KFC' is translated as '肯德基' which is the correct translation, but the phrase '在肯德基給我' is not necessary and changes the meaning of the sentence.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
When did Kent give you this cell phone? Did he give you anything else
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did Kent give you this cell phone?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'this cell phone' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question 'Did he give you anything else?' in the translation.

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷前一天給我這隻手機，除了手機外他還給我400元美金當住宿費和伙食費
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他在我離開曼谷前一天給我這隻手機'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the $400 given for restaurant bills and meals.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the $400 being given as accommodation and meal expenses.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
What's the purpose of him?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'him' as the subject

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他告訴我他會用這隻手機聯絡我，另外要找我拿這高爾夫球袋的人也會用這隻手機聯絡我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他告訴我他會用這隻手機聯絡我，另外也會有人要找我拿這高爾夫球袋，也會用這隻手機聯絡我。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person who wants to pick up the golf bags will also contact the user through the mobile phone.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
 So if you take this cell phone, someone will call you and meet you to take this bag?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
是的，肯特告訴我，當我到台灣，會有人用這手機打給我來拿高爾夫球袋
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of someone contacting and meeting the user to take the bag, the user's translation mentions someone calling the user to pick up a golf bag.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know who will call you?

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我不知道誰會聯絡我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You have said that the person who gave you the golf bag also gave you US400 dollars. Is this money regarded as monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '酬勞' as 'monetary compensation' instead of 'reward'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想那只是要當我的住宿費跟伙食費而已
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions 'paying hotel bills and meals', while the user's translation only mentions 'accommodation and meals'.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So besides US400 dollars, you will get another US1000 dollars after you go back to Thailand?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
據我所知是這樣的，只要我把高爾夫球袋交給那個人，在我回泰國時，就能拿到1000塊美金
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'bag' as '高爾夫球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of '包裹' which means 'bag' in general.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about bringing the bag into Taiwan, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the mention of giving the bag to someone, which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the mention of receiving 1000 dollars, which is not mentioned in the original text.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So you have known that you bring the heroin to Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text, changing the meaning from 'knowing' to 'bringing'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不，不是這樣，我並不知道有海洛因藏在球桿裡
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions heroin being hidden inside a club, but the user's translation mentions heroin being hidden inside a pool cue (球桿).

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don't you think that if the person just ask you to bring the gold to Taiwan, he will not give you such a big amount of compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我並不覺得這酬勞是否過高，我只是想要賺錢阿
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you ever thought that why the person don't bring this bag by himself
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特說他很忙，需要有人幫他
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb '需要' (need) should come before the subject '肯特' (Kent).

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
 Even if the things in the club is gold, it also violates the law.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我只知道黃金在泰國算是便宜的，我並不知道帶黃金回台灣是違法的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the user does not know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan, but the user's translation states that they do not know if bringing gold back to Taiwan is illegal.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why do you think it was okay to bring gold to Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the sentence.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就只是黃金阿，會有什麼大問題嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Did you check what was in the bag when you took it
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'when you took it' which is an important detail in the original text.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有，因為這包包被封起來了，我不覺得我可以打開
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為這包包被封起來了，我不覺得我可以打開'.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
 Don't you ever think that that person will conceive you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月就認識肯特了，我們可以說是夥伴，我想我是可以為他做事的，我覺得他是好人阿，他應該不會騙我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'work mates' as '夥伴' which means 'partners' instead of '同事' which means 'colleagues'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form '是' after '我們' instead of using '成為' to indicate the possibility of becoming work mates.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the possibility of becoming work mates in the future.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about meeting Kent in March.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the possibility of working for Kent.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about Kent being a good person and not lying.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
You mean that the person has the willing to work with you, so you just trust him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對阿，我們會一起工作，這就是我相信他的原因
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
Okay, in addition to the questions you have answered, do you have any further explanation?Do you want to the court to investigate any other evidence?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我很遺憾發生這樣的事，我真的不知道袋子裡是什麼，我一直以為在袋子裡的是黃金，如果知道是黃金，我絕對不會帶來台灣，請原諒我吧
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' which means 'gold', but the original text mentioned 'heroin'.

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
Besides Kent, do you have more concrete details to help the police to found the person who gave you this bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the bag in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我只有那隻他給我的手機
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of Kent giving the cell phone.

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
So far you have been in detaintion, do you want to call someone?

Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
可以聯絡我在曼谷的家人和在英國的孩子嗎?他們一定很擔心我，我本來預計在12月底就能回去的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'contact' as '可以聯絡', which means 'can contact', but the original text does not imply asking for permission to contact the family and kids. It simply states the desire to contact them.

下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。
The next court will be the trial procedure. You have the right to a lawyer. After you have a lawyer, you can meet him and know what is going on. Do you understand?If necessary, the lawyer can help you to contact with your family. Understand?

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
So what's the purpose that he gave you this cell phone?

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
So you mean when you brought this cell phone into Taiwan, there will be someone calling you and meeting you to take the golf bag
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of the original text

是的，坎特告訴我當我抵達台灣時，會有人打給我並來拿高爾夫球袋。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bag' as '高爾夫球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of the intended meaning of 'bag'.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
So do you know who will contact you?

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我並不知道誰會打給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不知道誰會打給我。'

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You just mentioned that in addition to cell phone, the person who asked you to bring the golf bag also gave you 400 dollars, is that also the monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '酬勞' as 'monetary compensation' instead of 'reward'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我覺得那筆金錢就是供給我的食宿費用而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions 'paying hotel bills and meals', while the user's translation only mentions 'supplying food and accommodation expenses'.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So you mean in addition to 400 dollars, after you successfully go back to Tailand, you will get 1000 dollars?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
這就是我認為的。當我到台灣並把高爾夫球袋交出去，然後再回到泰國之後，我就會得到1000美元的酬勞。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'bag' as '高爾夫球袋' (gāo'ěrfū qiúdài) which means 'golf bag' instead of 'bag'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of bringing the bag into Taiwan, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of getting another thousand dollars upon returning to Bangkok, which is an important detail in the original text.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So when you accept this work, did you know what you brought was heroine?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '海洛因' as 'heroine' instead of 'heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不不，我並不知道海洛因藏在高爾夫球袋裡面。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that heroin was hidden inside the club, but the user's translation mentions that heroin was hidden inside a golf bag.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don't you think that if the person just asked you to bring the gold to Taiwan, the monetary compensation, that is, 1000 dollars, is a little too hight?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '代價' as 'monetary compensation' instead of 'price'.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道這代價到底高不高，我只是想賺點錢而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'I don't know if that's too much' is translated as '我不知道這代價到底高不高', which means 'I don't know if the price is high or not'. This does not capture the intended meaning of 'if that's too much'.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Do you think about that why didn't the person bring it by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
坎特跟我說他非常忙，所以需要有人來幫他。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'need' should agree with the subject 'someone', so it should be 'needs' instead of 'need'.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even though there was gold in the golf bag, you should know that bringing gold into the airport may be also illegal, isn't it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '高爾夫球袋' as 'golf bag' instead of 'golf club bag'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'even though' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'bringing gold into the airport' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the phrase 'may be also illegal' in the translation.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我只知道黃金在泰國有比較便宜，但我不知道帶黃金入境台灣是否違法。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the user does not know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan, but the user's translation states that they do not know if bringing gold into Taiwan is against the law.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why did you think that bring gold into Taiwan will not have problems?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就是黃金啊，應該不會有太大的問題啊，會嗎？
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Did you check what was inside when you take the bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'inside' in the translation.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
不，我並沒有因為袋子被封住了。我並不覺得我打開袋子是妥當的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我並沒有因為袋子被封住了。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'I don't think I can open a bag' is incorrect. It should be translated as '我不認為我能打開袋子'.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
You trust the person so much and don't think you may be conned?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我和坎特在3月碰面的，我覺得我跟他可以成為很好的工作夥伴啊。我覺得他是個很好的人啊，我不覺得他會欺騙我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我和坎特在3月碰面的' is incorrect. It should be '我在3月和坎特碰面的'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我覺得我跟他可以成為很好的工作夥伴啊' is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as '我覺得我們可以成為很好的工作夥伴啊' to convey the idea of becoming work partners.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我不覺得他會欺騙我' is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as '我相信他不會欺騙我' to convey the idea of trusting him not to lie.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
Do you mean that that person told you he may cooperate with you in the business so that you don't doubt him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
是的，我覺得我們會一起合作，所以我才這麼信任他。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '我覺得我們會一起合作' does not capture the idea of trust expressed in the original text.

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我對於發生的事感到非常遺憾，我真的不知道袋子裡面是什麼。對方告訴我裡面就是黃金啊！如果我知道裡面是海洛因，我絕對不會因為一時的貪念而將它帶到台灣的。請原諒我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'gold' as '黃金' (huángjīn) instead of '金子' (jīnzi).

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail of providing specific information about the person who asked for the work.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我只有他給我的那隻手機而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'All I have is the cell phone' is translated as '我只有他給我的那隻手機而已', which means 'I only have the cell phone he gave me.' The user's translation adds the pronoun '他' (he) which is not present in the original text.

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？

Defendant Julio Johansen, on the 5th of December 2013 was found drug-trafficking at Taoyuan International Airport with a golf bag.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag' as '對肯特說會有人跟我聯絡,在我入境之後來拿高爾夫球袋', which means 'someone told Kent that someone would contact me and take the golf bag after I entered the country'. The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know who will contact you?

No, I don't know who's going to call me.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '酬勞' as 'compensation' instead of 'payment' or 'reward'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我覺得那是支付我飯店和食物的費用
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'just' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'figured' as '覺得' which means 'to feel' instead of 'to understand' or 'to realize'.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So, other than the 400 USD, after you successfully arrive to Thailand, you will get an extra 1000 USD right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the word '回到' as 'arrive to' instead of 'return to'.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
這就是我的認知, 在我在台灣把這個袋子交給別人之後,我在泰國就會拿到一千美金酬勞
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and receiving another thousand dollars when returning to Bangkok, while the user's translation talks about handing the bag to someone in Taiwan and receiving a thousand dollars as a reward in Thailand.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So before you take this offer, did you know you were going to take heroin?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '帶的是海洛因' as 'take heroin' instead of 'bring heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不不, 我完全不知道海洛因藏在這些高爾夫球桿裡
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not convey the same meaning as the original text. The original text mentions that heroin was hidden inside the club, while the user's translation mentions that heroin was hidden inside golf clubs.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think that to ask you bring gold into Taiwan with this price 1000 USD, isn’t it a bit too high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我是不知道代價是不是太高, 但我覺得錢很好賺
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Haven’t you thought for yourself why didn’t that guy bring it himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特說他很忙需要有人幫他
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even if it’s not heroin but gold, aren’t you supposed to know that bringing certain amount of gold is illegal?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by using 'certain amount of gold' instead of 'gold' and adds the word 'illegal'.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道黃金在泰國價格不高, 但是我不知道在台灣違不違法
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions the price of gold in Thailand, while the user's translation talks about the price not being high. This is a mismatched meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why do you think there will be no problem to bring gold into Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金也只是黃金, 這不會是太大的問題不是嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Did you check the bag before you get the bag?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
我沒有, 因為袋子是封起來的, 我不覺得我有權利把它打開
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不覺得我有權利把它打開, 因為袋子是封起來的'.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
How can you trust someone so easily? Don’t you think you’ll get conned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Don't you think you'll get conned?'.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月遇到肯特所以未來有可能替他工作, 肯特人感覺很好我沒想到他會騙我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of 'possibility' as '未來有可能' (possibility in the future) instead of '有可能' (possibility).
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error. '肯特人感覺很好' (Kent person feels good) should be '肯特人很好' (Kent is good).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of meeting Kent in March, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the possibility of becoming work mates, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of Kent not lying, which is an important detail in the original text.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
You mean he wanted to be in business cooperation with you, so you trusted him right
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the sentence.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對我以為我們會一起工作所以才會相信他
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not convey the same meaning as the original text.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
Okay so on top of the questions you answered, is there any other statements you want to state? Is there other concrete information or evidence you want the court to investigate?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我對這件事情感到抱歉, 我不知道袋子裡裝得是什麼, 那時候他說是黃金, 我如果知道是海洛因的話, 我絕對不會帶的, 請原諒我拜託
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' which means 'gold', but the original text mentioned 'heroin'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'to Taiwan' which was present in the original text.

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
Other than Kent, is there someone more specific you can assist the police to investigate who wants you to bring the bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the bag in their translation.

Next court trial will be the investigatory procedure, you can choose an attorney you can meet up with the attorney and clarify what happened. If necessary, you can ask the attorney to contact your family. Do you understand
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '審理程序' as 'investigatory procedure' instead of 'trial procedure'.

他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？
And where did he give you that golf bag?

He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
他叫我在曼谷的一家肯德基跟他碰面。

你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
And why did you bring that golf bag to Taiwan under his request?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the person who requested the golf bag to be brought to Taiwan.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
是的，這是肯特給我的手機。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'Kent' as '肯特' instead of '肯特'.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Does this cellphone belong to yourself?

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不是，這不是我自己的手機。這是肯特給我的手機，是肯特把SIM卡放進手機之中再給我的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這是肯特給我的手機'.

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我這支手機。除了手機之外，他還給我四百美金，以支付飯店費用和餐費。

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
So what is the purpose that he gave you that cellphone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他告訴我，他會透過這支手機跟我聯絡。此外，要來拿高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這支手機跟我聯繫。

So do you mean that somebody will call you via this phone and pick up the bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
是的，肯特告訴我，有人會跟我聯繫，並且跟我碰面拿走這個球袋。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '有人會跟我聯繫，並且跟我碰面拿走這個球袋。'

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
So do you know who he or she is to have contact with you?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我不知道誰會打電話給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不知道誰會打電話給我。'

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You just talked about the 400 US dollars, so what is it for, or is it your monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the purpose of the 400 US dollars.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我覺得這是付我的飯店費用和餐費而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'just' in their translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So when you successfully brought this golf bag into Taiwan and returned to Bangkok, you will get another 100 US dollars apart from these 400 US dollars, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '400元' as '400 US dollars' instead of '400 yuan'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '1000美金' as '100 US dollars' instead of '1000 US dollars'.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
對，這是我瞭解到的。對，當我把球袋帶進台灣之後，再回到曼谷，我會拿到另外的一千美金。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bag' as '球袋' which means 'ball bag' instead of '行李袋' which means 'luggage bag'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '帶' (bring) before the noun '球袋' (bag), resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about bringing the bag from Taiwan to Bangkok, which is crucial for understanding the context.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the word '美金' (US dollars) at the end, which is not present in the original text.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
Did you know at the beginning that what you brought was actually heroine?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '海洛因' as 'heroine' instead of 'heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不，我真的不知道海洛因藏在球桿裡面。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'club' as '球桿' which means 'golf club' instead of '俱樂部' which means 'club' in the context of a venue or establishment.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don't you think that if he only asked you to bring gold into Taiwan, the monetary compensation, which is 1000 US dollars, is too high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '代價' as 'monetary compensation' instead of 'price'.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道這個酬勞算不算太高，我只是想賺一點額外的錢。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the amount of money they want to earn.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you ever thought that that person would not like to bring this bag into Taiwan on his own?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特告訴我他很忙，想找個人幫他。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '肯特告訴我他很忙，想找個人幫他。'

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even if it was gold hidden inside that bag, it would still violate the law set by Taiwan.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我只知道黃金在泰國比較便宜，我不知道把黃金帶進台灣是不是違法的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why do you think that it would be no problem for you to bring gold into Taiwan?

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
When you receive the bag, did you check what was inside in that bag?

Do you really trust that person that much and do not think that you will be conned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you not think that you will be conned and trust that person that much?'

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
當我在三月遇到肯特的時候，那個時候我們有可能之後變成工作夥伴。 所以我覺得可以幫他工作，他是一個好人，不會騙我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '當我在三月遇到肯特的時候' is incorrect. It should be '當我在三月遇到肯特時候'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我們有可能之後變成工作夥伴' is translated as 'there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on'. The correct translation should be 'we had the possibility of becoming work partners later'.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
Did he ever say that he would like to work with you as a partner, so you believe in him?

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對，所以這就是為什麼我那麼信任他。

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
Apart from the statements you made, do you have anything to add? Is there any evidence that you would like the court to investigate for you?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我真的所發生的事很抱歉，我不知道袋子裡子藏了什麼東西，他告訴我袋子裡面是黃金，如果我知道袋子裡面是海洛因的話，我真的不會帶這個袋子來台灣。請原諒我。

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我只有肯特給我的手機而已。

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
Now, you are in detention. Do you have anyone that you would like us to have contact with?

omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of the defendant being caught with the drugs

I plead no guilty.
無罪辯答
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'not guilty' instead of 'no guilty'.

請問你此行出發地為何？
Can I ask where did you take the flight?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I departed from Bangkok, Thailand.
我從泰國的曼谷出發

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It was my carry-on.
那是我的隨身行李
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你知道高爾夫球袋中，有幾根桿子嗎？
Did you know that how many golf sticks were there in your bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '高爾夫球袋中' as 'your bag' instead of 'the golf bag'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'were' instead of 'are' in the question.

I don’t know a few, maybe.
我不知道，大概就…幾根吧!

那你知道球桿中藏有毒品嗎？
And did you know that in one of your golf sticks, there were actually narcotics inside?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text.

No, I don't.
我不知道你面藏有毒品耶，我來之前只有人跟我說裡面有黃金
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the sentence. Instead of saying 'No, I don't', the user's translation says 'I don't know if you have drugs hidden on you, someone only told me there is gold inside.'

這高爾夫球袋是誰給你的？在哪裡給你的？
So who gave you this golf bag and where?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the details of who gave the golf bag and where it was given.

The name of the guy who gave me the bag was Kent. I met him in Bangkok and he hired me to work for him. I am a computer engineer. He gave me this one ball bag at a KFC in Bangkok.
是一個名叫肯特的人給我的。我在曼谷遇到他，他僱用我為他工作。我是一個電腦工程師，他請我幫他把袋子帶到台灣，他跟我約在曼谷的肯德基見面。

給你高爾夫球袋、要你把它帶入台灣的人是誰？ 你認識他嗎？知道對方的姓名嗎?

I only know him as Kent, we met earlier in March 2013.
我之知道他的名字叫肯特，我們是2013年的三月見面的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I only know him as Kent' as '我之知道他的名字叫肯特', which means 'I know his name is Kent'. The meaning is not accurately conveyed.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user translated 'we met earlier in March 2013' as '我們是2013年的三月見面的', which means 'we met in March 2013'. The word order is incorrect.

Kent是對方的姓、還是名？這是他的真名嗎？
Is Kent his surname or given name? Is it his real name?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.
我想這是他的真名，但我不知道他姓什麼。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'real name' as '真名' which means 'true name' instead of '真實姓名' which means 'real full name'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (is) before the subject '他' (he), resulting in incorrect word order.

他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？
Where did he give you the gold bag?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Where did he give you the golf bag?'

He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
他只跟我說我們在曼谷的一家肯德基碰面
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'KFC' as '肯德基' which is the Chinese translation of KFC, instead of using the original English term.

你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
Why did you want to take the golf bag to Taiwan for him?

He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
他說他要付我1000塊美元，如果我幫他把高爾夫球袋帶到台灣的話，我想要賺錢，所以覺得這是個不錯的差事。

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'to Taiwan' in the translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the mention of 'golf bag' in the translation, which is not present in the original text.

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
Did you say that he asked to pay you 1000 US dollars as monetary compensation and you have to take the gold bag to Taiwan for him? Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '高爾夫球袋' as 'gold bag' instead of 'golf bag'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'asked' before the subject 'he' instead of after.

Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
對啊，他說我只要把高爾夫球袋帶到台灣就可以了，其他事都不用做。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他說我只要把高爾夫球袋帶到台灣就可以了，其他事都不用做。'

對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
Did he ever tell you that when you arrive at Taiwan what will happen? What do you have to do next? I mean, will there be anyone to get into contact with you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
肯特告訴我，就待在某間飯店裡，會有人打電話跟我接洽，手機是他給我的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '肯特告訴我，待在某間飯店裡，會有人打電話跟我接洽，手機是他給我的。'

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
Is this cell phone you just mentioned the one that the police officer found at Taoyuan International Airport? I mean is this the confiscated cell phone?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '扣案' as 'confiscated' instead of 'found'.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
對，就是那隻nokia的手機。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '隻' is used for counting animals or certain objects, not for phones.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
Now, here I’m going to show you the evidence one. Please the defendant confirm that is this cell phone you just mentioned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
對，這就是肯特給我的那支手機。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. '肯特給我的那支手機' should be translated as 'the cell phone that Kent gave me,' but the user's translation says 'this is the cell phone Kent gave me,' which changes the meaning slightly.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is this cell phone your personal belonging?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'this cell phone', so it should be 'Is this cell phone your personal belonging?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不，這不是我的手機。這是肯特給我的，他把sim 卡裝在裡面，然後給了我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這是肯特給我的'.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
Did you mean that this cell phone was given by the one that gave you the golf bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the original meaning of the sentence.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對，他在肯德基給我的…
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'phone' is translated as '給我的' which means 'given to me' instead of '手機' which means 'phone'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'this' which is an important detail in the original text.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural reference of 'KFC'.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
On which day did he give you the cell phone? In addition to the cell phone, did he give you any other things else?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷前一天給我那支手機的，除了手機，他還給我400美金供我吃住。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他在我離開曼谷前一天給我那支手機。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'restaurant bills and meals' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '$400' in the translation.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
So what is his intention to give you this cell phone?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'intention' is not accurately translated as '目的' in this context.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他告訴我他會用這支手機連絡我，還有那個要跟我拿包包的人也會用這支手機跟我聯絡
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他告訴我他會用這支手機連絡我'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'pick up golf bags' as '要跟我拿包包' is incorrect. It should be translated as '要拿取高爾夫球袋'.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
which means that when you took this cell phone into Taiwan, someone will call you, meet you up and take the golf bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text and changes the meaning.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對，肯特跟我說當我到台灣的時候，就會有人打電話給我跟我拿高爾夫球袋
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. 'Someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag' is translated as '有人打電話給我跟我拿高爾夫球袋' which means 'someone will call me and take the golf bag from me'.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know that who will get into contact with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我不知道誰會打給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You just answered that the one gave you the cell phone will also give you 400 US dollars. Will this count as monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想這筆錢應該就是提供我吃住吧
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
so besides these 400 dollars, when you get back to Thailand successfully, you will get another 1000 US dollars. Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
對我是這麼想的。在我把高爾夫球袋給指定的人之後，可以回到泰國，並且拿到1000塊美金。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and coming back to Bangkok to receive another thousand dollars, while the user's translation mentions giving a golf bag to someone and returning to Thailand to receive 1000 US dollars.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So when you accepted this case, did you know that what you brought is actually heroine?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '海洛因' as 'heroine' instead of 'heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不不不，我根本就不知道裡面是海洛因
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user's translation states that they didn't know what was inside the club, while the original text states that they didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
don’t you think that if he just wants you to bring gold into Taiwan, this price, I mean 1000 US dollars is a bit too high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '代價' as 'price' instead of 'cost'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user places the verb 'is' before the subject '1000 US dollars', resulting in incorrect word order.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不管他給我多少錢，我只是想要賺錢而已
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
 Have you ever thought about why didn’t the person just bring the gold by himself?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'gold' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'didn't' before the subject 'the person', resulting in incorrect word order.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
even though you know that in the golf bag was actually gold, you should have known that bringing gold into Taiwan it may be against the law, isn’t it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '就算' as 'even though' instead of 'even if'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'in the golf bag' before the verb 'was', resulting in incorrect word order.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for adultery. The plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case of today. It’s mainly because her husband John Anderson has an intimate relation with one of the teacher in the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. Plus, the defendant usually tends to go home late and has close relation with Tsai Yen Wang in the cram school and even had video telephoning. The plaintiff found that everything proves that her husband and his coworker are actually beyond coworker’s relationship. That’s why the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, your wife suspects you of committing adultery. What’s your plea?

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	missing subject-verb agreement

Not guilty, of course.
當然無罪啊
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
For today’s preparatory procedure, we are mainly here for the contents of those intimate messages. In order to figure out whether the defendant really has adultery with his coworker. Do both parties understand the procedures?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
I have questions for the plaintiff. How long have you been married to your husband? Do you have any children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
My husband and I have married for four years and we don’t have any children.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'husband and I', so it should be 'have been' instead of 'have'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you and your husband get married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan. Four years ago he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past few years, your husband’s work in Taiwan was teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
Well, when we just met he was an Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued to teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular foreign language to learn in Taiwan so his teaching hours were quite unstable. Sometimes he might have a period between jobs. This period can be long to a month. Afterwards, in order to make his income more stable, he started to teach English. But because his mother tongue is not English, he decides to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Well, when we just met he was an Portuguese teacher' is incorrect. It should be 'Well, when we just met, he was a Portuguese teacher'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence 'After we got married, he continued to teach Portuguese'. It should be 'After we got married, he continued teaching Portuguese'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense is incorrect in the sentence 'However, Portuguese is not a popular foreign language to learn in Taiwan so his teaching hours were quite unstable'. It should be 'However, Portuguese is not a popular foreign language to learn in Taiwan so his teaching hours are quite unstable'.
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	The article is missing in the sentence 'Sometimes he might have a period between jobs'. It should be 'Sometimes he might have a period between the jobs'.
grammar and structure	preposition errors	The preposition 'to' is missing in the sentence 'Sometimes he might have a period between jobs'. It should be 'Sometimes he might have a period between jobs'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma in the sentence 'Sometimes he might have a period between jobs. This period can be long to a month'. It should be 'Sometimes he might have a period between jobs, and this period can be long, up to a month'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the husband wants to seek an advanced degree in English. This detail is present in the original text.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. Does this mean a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the advanced degree is in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan so that degree must be related to English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California for teaching English. He doesn’t have to go to America but still can have the courses by on-line learning. In this case, after he finishes all the courses he can get a master degree. His plan is through this degree he got from the United States he can get a job in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'because he wants to teach English in Taiwan so that degree must be related to English teaching' is incorrect. It should be 'because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, the degree must be related to English teaching.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'He found a distance learning program in California for teaching English' is not an accurate translation. The original text states that he found a distance learning program in California for teaching English, but the translation implies that he found a program in California that teaches English.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the detail that the distance learning program is offered by a university in California.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the detail that the distance learning program allows him to complete the requirements through correspondence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the detail that he needs to complete all the credits in order to obtain the master's degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the detail that his goal is to find a job as an English teacher in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s his relationship with this woman that he commits the adultery?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in cram school. The cram school arranges he to partner with somebody, a Taiwanese, and that woman was his partner.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'arranges' should agree with the subject 'cram school', so it should be 'arranges' instead of 'arrange'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'he to partner with somebody' does not accurately convey the meaning of '中師跟外師搭檔教學', which means 'partnering with a Taiwanese teacher and a foreign teacher'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail that the woman is the '中師' (Taiwanese teacher).

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know that they have adultery?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'adultery' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first I just found out that my husband stayed quite long after work in the cram school. I have asked him several times that it’s just an English cram school, why did you need to stay so long after work in the cram school? He told me that because he had to partner with a Taiwanese so that they needed a lot of time to communicate and discuss about the course. At the very beginning, I really didn’t suspect him of anything. After I found out he got some phone calls quite often after work and when he received the call, he couldn’t speak in front of me. He always went to the study room. It started to make me curious so I began to check his phone.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '中師搭檔教學' as 'partner with a Taiwanese' instead of 'partner with a Chinese teacher'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the protagonist checked her husband's phone because she became suspicious.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything unusual in his cellphone?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the singular verb 'find' instead of the plural verb 'finds' to match the subject 'you'.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I saw that in his phone book I saw a number quite often. Because of that, I was curious again and started to check his messages. After the checking I found that he had messages of the same woman every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'phone book' instead of 'messages'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person was checking the messages out of curiosity.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the fact that the person found out that the messages were with a woman.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
They are just some messages, or are there any problems with the messages?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they are just some normal messages then it’s okay. But he’s a married man, how could he receive some intimate messages from others. Before, I did offer some contents of the messages to the court. They should already been included in the documents.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '讓對方發一些很親密的字句' as 'receive some intimate messages from others' instead of 'let the other party send some intimate words'.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please show the evidence record, page number 13. There are few messages. Please the defendant have a look. Are these messages from your phone?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '提示' as 'evidence record' instead of 'message'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'a few messages' in the translation

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對，這是我手機裡的簡訊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I have few questions concerning these messages for you. The first message was at 9:50 on the date 31st November in 2002 from the cellphone number 0958932xxx. The contents were “I really miss you my love.” What did that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
喔，這只是我一個同事傳給我的，我記得我那時候大概放了兩天假吧，她大概是有點擔心，這就是為什麼她傳給我這封簡訊啊。我的同事她在美國受教育所以她算是心胸鰻寬闊的，這就是她說話的方式還有自我表現的方式。至於「my love」這個字，只是用來稱呼一些我們關心的人
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'open-minded' as '心胸鰻寬闊的'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'my love' as '用來稱呼一些我們關心的人'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Did you mean that because this colleague has spent some time in the united states, her thought was kind of westernized and her way of expressing herself was quite open as well. So “my love” means nothing special, is that right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the meaning of 'my love' in the context of the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
不是，這只是一個很平常的稱呼而已，就是用來稱呼我們在乎的人。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
what about the sentence before

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我剛剛講過了，她很擔心我，我們是工作上面的同事，當我沒去工作兩天，她當然會想我啊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們是工作上的同事' instead of '我們是工作上面的同事'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean she’s just because you hadn’t been to work for two days, that’s why she sent you this message; because without your assistance in the class so she misses you? Is that all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對，這就是簡訊的內容，這沒有什麼大不了的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second text was at 11:55pm on 13rd January in 2003. This message was from the same number as the first one. The content was “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together我希望你在我身邊 我們什麼時候才能真正在一起呢”. What does this message mean? Why is it possible to have this kind of contexts?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫給我這句話是因為想告訴我一個課本上面出現的句子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Do you mean she send you this message because she wants you help from the text book? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
因為我太太幫我申請這個課程，所以我有一個線上教學的課程。在這個課程裡我需要修滿30個學分才可以拿到學位。當然我會需要完成一些練習啊，還有作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為我太太幫我申請這個課程，所以我有一個線上教學的課程。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'Master's program' as '線上教學的課程' does not accurately convey the meaning. '碩士課程' would be a more appropriate translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about completing assignments and exercises, which is an important detail in the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you please explain what’s your master degree about?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是英語教學，這個課程裡爸都是跟英語教學有關的，但有些其他課程是跟文化還有語言能力相關。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '爸' should be '都' to convey the meaning of 'all' or 'both'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '其他課程是跟文化還有語言能力相關' instead of '其他課程是跟文化還有語言能力相關的'.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So the master degree is mainly about English teaching but there are some courses about language competence and culture, is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得大概有三門課都和文化還有溝通相關吧。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So how do the courses related to communication? What kind of assignments they gave you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'related' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'related' and 'courses' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
關於文化與溝通的作業呢，針對每個學生都是不一樣的，以我自己為例，我是一個在台灣想獲得英語教學資格的人，為了達成這個要求，我需要符合一些資格，必須要具備一定的中文能力，所以我有一些作業都是中文和英語之間的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '以我自己為例，我是一個在台灣想獲得英語教學資格的人'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. The correct form should be '我需要符合一些資格，必須具備一定的中文能力'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'assignments' as '作業' is incorrect. '作業' means 'homework' in Chinese, but 'assignments' refers to tasks or projects given by a teacher or professor.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'culture and communication courses' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of 'many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation' in the original text.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan so you have to prove yourself with enough Chinese competence, is that right? Thus, you have to finish some assignments from the course and these assignments are translation between English and Chinese. Is that true?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對，就是這樣，我真的很想增進自己的寫作能力還有說的能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s go back to what we discussed before that it’s your assignment right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得這個句子啊，當我拿到這個中文句子的時候，我實在不知道怎麼樣用英文表達，你們都知道吧，有些中文字對外國人來說真的很難。我需要一些幫助，所以像我同事求救，我請她翻譯這個句子然後用簡訊傳給我。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	incorporating superfluous words or phrases

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You meant that you sent her the Chinese sentence and she sent you back the English translation of that sentence. So this message was just the answer for your assignments?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，這封簡訊就只是我作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Again, let’s have a look at the record from page 14 to 16. Here are some contents of the messages. Please have a careful look at the contents. Were all of these the answers of your assignments so that she sent you these messages?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the messages from pages 14 to 16.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，全部的簡訊都是我作業的答案。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '答案' (answer) is used instead of '翻譯' (translation).

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
what’s your explanation for your wife’s suspect of you having adultery with your colleague Tsai yen Wang?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '解釋' as 'explanation' instead of 'explanation for'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'what's your explanation' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'for your wife's suspect of you having adultery'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague's name 'Tsai yen Wang'

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了啦，我知道她對我對這個家的貢獻不太滿意，我希望庭上了解，在我開始修這個遠距課程的時候，她就沒有提供我任何課業上的幫助，她根本一點都不想幫我完成這個學位，如果她當初願意多幫助我一些，我就不用像我同事尋求協助啦，我覺得他應該要為這一切、這個事件負責。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misrepresentation of blame

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to you saying, it seems that you and your wife are not getting along too well, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們一開始結婚的時候，的確是處的蠻不錯的，但問題是在於我失業了，剛我想在台灣教葡萄牙語但工作時數很不穩定，所以我工作的問題就變成我們倆爭執的來源，我們常常為了這個問題吵架，她不相信我已經盡力了，我實在無法讓她了解我現在這個時期有多痛苦多難熬。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '剛我想在台灣教葡萄牙語'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'have faced' in the sentence '我實在無法讓她了解我現在這個時期有多痛苦多難熬'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s go back to the master degree we just discussed. When did you start the master degree? Has it ended already? When will you get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you start the master degree?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Has it already ended?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When will you get the degree?'

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年的春天開始上這個課，這個課程是兩年制，我應該要在2012年年底完成。我沒有辦法完成這個學位，因為我一邊上課一邊工作，沒有時間完成所有的作業。我剛剛前面有說過了，我太太完全不想幫忙，我覺得我好像一個人孤身奮戰想取得這個學位，我變得很累而且很沮喪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我剛剛前面有說過了'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我太太完全不想幫忙'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program, which is 'because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated, which is 'I became too tired and too frustrated'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling alone in pursuing the degree, which is 'I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that it’s a two-year course but you didn’t finish it at the end. Why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你最後沒有完成' as 'you didn't finish it at the end' instead of 'you didn't finish it in the end'.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成所有課程的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'couldn't' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When did you last register for the courses? When will it end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
上一次註冊的課程是在2012年秋季班。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'semester' which is an important detail in the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'registration' as '課程' which means 'course' instead of '註冊' which means 'registration'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
According to what you just mentioned, the last day of your course will be December 5th, 2012 so after that you shouldn’t have any more assignments right? But the messages were actually six months after the course ended. What’s your explanation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning of the text.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我可能的確是沒有完成這個課程啦，但這不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。即使我沒有辦法取得學位，但我持續想精進我的中文能力，這就是為什麼我還是繼續練習啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You what you meant is that even you couldn’t get the degree, you still want to continue learning Chinese to make it become more fluent. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是我向我同事尋求協助的原因
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague is actually serving as a tutor for you right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是像一個家教還是一個真正的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
我曾經想付錢給她，但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經想付錢給她，但她拒絕了'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she need to send you messages that it’s the time that she should already fall into sleep? Wasn’t that beyond what a colleague should do?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個真的想幫忙我的朋友啊，她用她自己的時間來幫我學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我才說她是一個真的想幫忙我的朋友啊'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still at the same cram school teaching English?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
對 我還在那裏工作

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
What about the colleague Tsai yen Wang? Is she still there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The subject and verb are inverted in the question.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
對，她還在這家補習班任職，但是我們不再是搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是我們不再是搭檔了' instead of '但是我們不再是搭檔了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any further evidence to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena Tsai yen Wang who teaches in Powen cram school to come to the court to give us some information. I would like her to clarify her relationship with the defendant and the background of writing all these messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I want to subpoena Tsai yen Wang, who teaches in Powen cram school, to come to court to give us some information.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'subpoena' is not appropriate in this context. It should be 'invite' or 'request' instead.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the reason for inviting Tsai yen Wang to court, which is to have her testify as a witness.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Does the plaintiff have any evidence that want us to investigate?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'plaintiff' in the translation, which is an important detail in the context.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'want' instead of 'wants' to match the singular subject 'plaintiff'.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I’ve heard that the cram school had some actions according to the relation between my husband and that woman. In that discussion, they also mentioned the unemployment of tsai yen wang. I wander if I can ask evidences from the cram school.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'wander' should be 'wonder'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'wander' should be 'wonder', and it should agree with the subject 'I'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the actions taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the attempt to persuade Tsai Yen Wang to resign.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of seeking evidence from the cram school.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds the mention of 'my husband' which is not present in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
The defendant, do you want the court to find any evidence for you? Now the fact is that your master course has already ended on December 5th in 2012. You have no right to blame all these messages on completing the assignments. Especially that all your messages were sent after 9pm. This is really doubting. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'You have no right to blame all these messages on completing the assignments.' The correct word order should be: 'You have no right to blame completing the assignments on all these messages.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '實在起人疑竇' as 'This is really doubting.' The correct translation should be 'This raises suspicions.'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到任何可以請庭上幫我調查的證據，我剛剛說過了，我和我同事之間的關係真的非常的簡單，我真的只是想增進我的中文能力然後繼續學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我剛剛說過了，我和我同事之間的關係真的非常簡單'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the reason for the communication between my colleague and me' is translated as '我和我同事之間的關係' which means 'the relationship between my colleague and me'. The meaning is not accurately conveyed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'improving language ability' and 'continuing to learn Chinese', which are important details in the original text.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court day will be 4:30pm on June 9th in 2014 for the inquiry procedure of witness. The plaintiff and the defendant both have to show up. If necessary, both parties can hire lawyers.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '中華民國103年06月09日' as 'June 9th in 2014' instead of 'June 9th, 2014'.

我明白。
 I understand.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are going to process the procedure of adultery case. The plaintiff Cheng Yu Hua suit the case.The reason why is that the Cheng Yu Hua’s husband has intimate with his colleague in the cram school. And plaintiff found some intimate message from her husband’s cell phone.Plus, her husband often makes up reason for working and using tele-conferencing with Wan Tsai Yian at night. The information gathered by the plaintiff prove that it has beyond co-worker relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed the case. Defendant, your wife sues you the adultery, what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The plaintiff Cheng Yu Hua suit the case.' It should be 'The plaintiff Cheng Yu Hua filed the case.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'has intimate with' should be 'has been intimate with' to indicate a past action.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant's name, John Anderston, in the sentence 'The reason why is that the Cheng Yu Hua’s husband has intimate with his colleague in the cram school.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the charge of adultery in the sentence 'Defendant, your wife sues you the adultery, what’s your plea?' It should be 'Defendant, your wife sues you for adultery, what’s your plea?'

Not guilty, of course.
我做無罪答辯
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我無罪答辯' instead of '我做無罪答辯'.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In  today preparation procedure, we will mainly focus on the message from the defendant and Wan Tsai Hua. The purpose of the procedure is to verified that there is any evidence to prove that the defendant and Wan Tsai Hua have adultery case. Do both  party understand the procedure?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you been married with your husband?Do you have a kid?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'has you been married'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question asks about the duration of the marriage, but the translation omits the word 'how long'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the question about having children.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for four years, and we don’t have children
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'have' should be in the present perfect tense to indicate an action that started in the past and continues to the present.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The original text mentions that the speaker and her husband do not have children, but this information is missing in the translation.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
So you and your husband get married  in the foreign country or in Taiwan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I meet my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he went to Taiwan because he want to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'meet' should be in the past tense to agree with the past time frame.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the user and her husband met in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the husband came to Taiwan specifically to teach Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In past few year, is his job mainly focus on teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Has his job mainly focused on teaching Portuguese in the past few years?'

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese. After we get married, he still teach the Portuguese.Since Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hour is not very stable. Sometimes there are a few months between the two cases.So he want to increase his income, he decided to teach English.However, his mother’s tongue is not English, so he decided to seek advance degree.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'Portuguese' should be 'Portuguese teacher' to indicate his profession.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'After we get married, he still teach the Portuguese' should be 'After we got married, he continued to teach Portuguese' to indicate that he continued teaching the language after getting married.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'Sometimes there are a few months between the two cases' should be 'Sometimes there are gaps of a few months between courses' to clarify that there are breaks between teaching periods.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The phrase 'So he want to increase his income' should be 'So he wanted to increase his income' to match the past tense used in the rest of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The phrase 'Since Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan' should be 'Since Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, it is not widely studied' to maintain subject-verb agreement.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The phrase 'Sometimes there are a few months between the two cases' should be 'Sometimes there were a few months between courses' to match the past tense used in the rest of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The phrase 'he decided to seek advance degree' should be 'he decided to pursue an advanced degree in English' to provide more specific information about his educational goals.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he decided to seek a advance degree.You mean he decided to get the degree?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of '進修' as 'get a degree' instead of 'seek an advanced degree'.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is the relationship between your husband and the person who he has affair with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇對象' as 'the person who he has affair with' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleague in the cram school.That  cram school arrange partner for teaching, and his partner is….that girl.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have adultery?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'adultery' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
First I noticed that my husband always stayed at cram school, working late.I asked him for many time that it is only a english cram school, there is no necessary to do extra works.He told me that since he had partner with a chinese teacher, so he have to spend some time to do the teaching plan. At first time, I really didn’t doubt him. Then, I noticed that after he came back home, there are some strange phone calls. And when he picked up the phone, he will go to the room and talk on the phone instead of in front of me. It makes me suspect him, so I check his cell phone.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'He told me that since he had partner with a chinese teacher, so he have to spend some time to do the teaching plan.' The correct word order should be 'He told me that since he had partnered with a Chinese teacher, he had to spend some time to do the teaching plan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the husband's partner is a Chinese teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the husband's extra phone calls are suspicious.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the wife checked her husband's cell phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Do you see any unusual thing in the cell phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is a same number appeared oftenly. So I check his message box.After that I found that he almost have contact with a same woman almost everyday.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'phone book' is not an accurate translation for '通訊紀錄'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they were curious about the content of the messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
 It is only some message. Is there any inappropriate information or context?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the tone and context of the original text

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it is just a normal message, that is okay.But he is already a married man, how can he let another woman to send some intimate message?I have already filed some of the message to the court previously. It should be contained in the filed.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of providing the message content to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please show the investigation file on page thirteen.There are some of the message in the cell phone.Defendant, please check the message. Are these message in your cell phone.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，這些是我的簡訊內容。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
So I will ask some question based on these message. The first message is sent from nine fifty, november thirty first, 2011. And it’s from 0958-932xxx. The context is I really miss you, my love. What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是同事寄給我的。我還記得那個時候我請兩天休假。她可能有點擔心，所以她就傳這個簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國接受教育的，所以她思想開放，這就是他說話的風格。至於愛人這個字，只不過是要表達對他人關心的意思。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that person have education in the foreign country, so she has much more western style mind, is that right?And her expression of feeling is much more open minded, right?Therefore the word my love have not any mean, right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of '我的愛' as having no special meaning, when in fact it is a term of endearment.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然沒有阿，這個字只是用來跟老朋友關心的用語。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，我們只不過是同事而已，我們在工作上是同事。我離開兩天，她自然會想我。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'partners' was translated as '同事' which means 'colleagues' instead of '合作伙伴' which means 'partners'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '就像我說的' should be 'As I said' instead of 'Like I said'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean because you took two days off, so your colleague worried about you. Without your assistance in the class, so she missed you, is that truth?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對這就是簡訊內容阿，簡訊本身沒有什麼。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the message was a text message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message is at eleven fifty five pm, january thirteen, 2012. It’s from the same cell phone.The detail of message is 「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」.Can you tell me what is the mean of the sentence?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這句話是因為說他想幫我表達這句中文的意思。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean she sent you this message because she want to help you with your assignment.Is that truth?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像他們說的，我現在正在完成一篇論文。因此我必須要完成十三個學分，我才能正式完成我的學位。那當然我必須要完成一些指定的作業...
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what’s your graduated school’s degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是英語教學。在這些課程裡面，有些是英語上的教學，有些是牽涉到文化的部份。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我的課程是英語教學。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'TESOL' as '英語教學' is incorrect. TESOL stands for 'Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages', which refers to the field of teaching English as a second or foreign language. The correct translation should be '對非英語為母語的人教授英語'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that 'some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence'.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
You mean that your have TESOL for your master degree, and there are some cross..related …….is that what your mean?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted important details in the translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added unnecessary information in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out critical context in the translation.
omission or addition	including irrelevant material	The user included irrelevant material in the translation.
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	The user missed cultural references or idiomatic expressions in the translation.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
我至少有三個課程關於文化還有溝通的部份。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有至少三個課程關於文化還有溝通的部份。'

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
In this course, what kind of assignment did this course provide you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'give' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這堂課給每個學生的作業可能都不一樣。對我來說好了，我在台灣想要尋求一個英語教學的工作。為了要展現出我的足夠的能力可以勝任這個工作，因此我必須要有良好的中文能力。所以我有很多的作業都是中英翻譯的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這堂課給每個學生的作業可能都不一樣。'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterpreted the cultural reference of 'culture and communication courses' as '這堂課' (this class) instead of '文化與溝通課程' (culture and communication courses).

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that since you want to teach english in Taiwan, so you have to get the English degree. And this degree required you to have competence of english and chinese. Is that right? So you have to finished some of the assignment for the class, and the context of this work is to translate these sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of completing assignments as part of the degree requirements.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
當然啦，我還被要求說要加強我的口說還有寫作。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So let’s back to the message, that is your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的我還記得那句話。當我看到那句中文時，我無法翻成英文。你也知道有些中文字對於外國人很難辨認。我需要一些幫助，所以我叫我的同事幫我。所以我請她翻完之後把答案傳給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that you asked your colleague to translate that sentence and she will send the answer back to you, is that what you mean?In other word, this message is the answer of your assignment.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就只是我功課上的答案而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
And now we’ll show you the investigatory file from page fourteen to sixteen,please see all the message on these pages. Please check these messages. Is these message that she want to help you with your assignment?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊都是她為了要幫我完成作業而傳給我的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'purpose' as '她為了要幫我完成作業而傳給我的', which means 'she sent them to me to help me complete my assignments', but the original text does not mention anyone sending messages to the user.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So for your wife, you have the affair with your colleague Wan Tsai Yian. What’s your explanation?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '王彩燕' as 'Wan Tsai Yian' instead of 'Wang Caiyan'.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我的太太真的想太多了。我知道她可能不太滿意我在家中沒有扮演支持上的角色。我想到的是說在我剛開始念書的時候，她從來沒有表現出支持我的意思。她根本就不想要幫我完成這個學業。如果她肯幫助我的話，那我根本就不需要問我的同事阿！我覺得她要為這些誤會負所有的責任。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	太太真的想太多了 -> My wife really thinks too much
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	我在家中沒有扮演支持上的角色 -> my ability of supporting the family
semantic conversion	omission of details	我想到的是說 -> I want the court to know that
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	我根本就不需要問我的同事阿！ -> If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	我覺得她要為這些誤會負所有的責任 -> I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, there seem to be some trouble between you and your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在剛開始結婚的時候，我們的確有一段甜蜜的時光。可是問題是在於我的工作。我想要再台灣教葡萄牙文，但我的工時並不穩定。然後我們的工作就變成我們吵架的理由。我們常常為了這件事情不停的吵架。她不相信我已經全力以赴了。她根本也不了解我我面臨了多艱困的處境。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我們常常為了這件事情不停的吵架'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, let’s back to the master degree course. When is your course begin? when do you graduate?Do you get your master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject and verb agreement is incorrect in the question.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of asking about the completion of the master degree.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春天開始上課的。那是一個兩年的課程。我應該要在2012年的十二月就要完成了。我並沒有完成是因為說我還要工作，所以我沒有時間完成這些作業。就像我說的，我的太太並不支持我。我覺得我只能孤軍奮戰，自己去解決那些問題。我覺得我太受挫折，而且我也很累了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我在2010年春天開始上課的'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '我應該要在2012年的十二月就要完成了'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Incorrect pronoun usage in the sentence '我覺得我只能孤軍奮戰，自己去解決那些問題'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '我並沒有完成是因為說我還要工作，所以我沒有時間完成這些作業'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated in the sentence '我覺得我太受挫折，而且我也很累了'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for lack of support from the wife in the sentence '我的太太並不支持我'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean it’s a two year project program, and you didn’t finish it. Can you tell me why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有完成那些作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'course' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when is your last registration semester over?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後...是在2012年的秋天。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'semester' which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the past tense 'was' instead of the present tense 'is' in the translation.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So you mean that after 2011, december fifth, you should not have any assignment after your last registration date, is that right? But you and your colleague still send the message after six month.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important information from the original text.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我已經完成了這些作業了，並不代表我不想繼續增進我的語文能力。就算我沒有拿到碩士學位，但是我還是想要繼續增進我的中文能力阿。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就算我沒有拿到碩士學位，但是我還是想要繼續增進我的中文能力。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even though you didn’t finish that program, you still want to improve your language ability, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為什麼我找我的同事幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague play the role of a teacher for you.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'teacher' instead of 'tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是個助教，而且是個真心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我想要付她錢，但是被她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想要付她錢，但是她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did her send you message at midnight for your work? Is that a little bit beyond the relationship between the colleague?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我就說她是一個一個很支持我的朋友。她都用她自己的時間來幫我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '一個很支持我的朋友' instead of '一個一個很支持我的朋友'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach english in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you still teach English in that cram school?'

Yes, I am still working there.
對我還在那邊工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
So your colleague Wan Tsai Yian, did she still work there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她還在那邊工作，不過我們也不再是夥伴的關係。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不過我們也不再是夥伴的關係。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any requirement for further investigation or the further evidence you want to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you have any requirement for further investigation or the further evidence you want to investigate, prosecutor?'

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena Wan Tsai Yian, who works in Bo Yuan cram school as a witness. I want her to….. the relationship between her and defendant. And I want to ask her about the context in the message.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific action they want Wan Tsai Yian to take as a witness.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' after the noun 'Wan Tsai Yian', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'subpoena' instead of 'summon' to request Wan Tsai Yian's presence as a witness.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the purpose of asking Wan Tsai Yian about the context in the message.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
For defendant, do you have any evidence which want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff as the party requesting the court to investigate evidence.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
 I’ve heard that cram school have do something for there relationship. And even the cram school asked Wan Tsai Yian to leave the job. I wonder we can ask the cram school about this thing.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '補習班' (cram school) as 'cram school' instead of 'the cram school'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'have' before the subject 'cram school' instead of after.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'more' before 'do something' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'to' before 'leave the job' which affects the grammatical structure of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'if' before 'we can ask the cram school' which changes the conditional meaning of the sentence.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate for you? The situation is that your course is already ended at december fifth, 2012.There is no reason that you still doing your assignment. Furthermore, you and Wan Tsai Yian send the message after nine o’clock pm, it makes people suspect.Do you have evidence that may help you with your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'There is no reason that you still doing your assignment' is incorrect. It should be 'There is no reason for you to still be doing your assignment.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'your course is already ended at december fifth, 2012' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'your master's degree has already ended on December 5th, 2012.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'send' should be in the past tense to match the context. It should be 'you and Wan Tsai Yian sent the message' instead of 'you and Wan Tsai Yian send the message.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant's interaction with Wang Caiyan through text messages. It should be 'you and Wang Caiyan's text message interaction' instead of 'you and Wan Tsai Yian send the message.'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The translation adds the phrase 'it makes people suspect' which is not present in the original text. It should be 'especially since most of your text message interactions were conducted after nine o'clock in the evening' instead of 'especially since you and Wan Tsai Yian send the message after nine o'clock pm, it makes people suspect.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant's master's degree. It should be 'your master's degree has already ended' instead of 'your course is already ended.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'it makes people suspect' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'it raises suspicions' instead.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我覺得我找不到任何證據可以讓法庭幫我。就像我說的，我跟我同事之間的關係就是這麼簡單，我只是想要繼續增進我的中文能力而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'communication' between the user and their colleague, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我覺得' (I think) at the beginning of the sentence, which is not the correct word order in Chinese. It should be placed after the subject.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the court set that at four thirty pm, june ninth 2012, we will arrange the court for questioning procedure. The plaintiff and defendant both have to come to the court at that day. If necessary, both side can have a lawyer, do you understand?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the date

我明白。
Yes, I do.

I understand.
是我了解

今天庭期到此結束。
Today procedure dismissed
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of adultery case. The plaintiff Chen Yu-Hua filed the case. It’s mainly because her husband John Anderson had close interaction with his colleague in cram school. The plaintiff discovered come intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. Also her husband would make up reasons for working late and had tele- conference with his colleague Wang Tsai-Yen. The evidence the plaintiff collected has beyond coworkers’ relationship. Therefore, she filed the case. The defendant, you are suspected of adultery, what’s your plea?

我沒有罪
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有罪' instead of '我沒有罪'.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In the preparatory procedure today, we are mainly going to talk about the details of the interaction between the defendant and his coworker. And the purpose is to clarify whether the defendant and his colleague’s interaction constitutes of adultery. Do both parties understand the procedure?

我明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you married your husband? Do you have kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should be changed to 'been married' to match the present perfect tense.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question does not include the information about having children.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for four years and we don’t have a kid.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'have been married' instead of 'have married'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker is referring to her husband. It should be 'my husband and I' instead of just 'we'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan. Four years ago, he just got to Taiwan and wanted to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past few years, his job is Taiwan was mainly teaching Portuguese, right?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense 'was' to match the context of the past few years.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a teacher who taught Portuguese. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hours was not stable. Sometime, the period between jobs may be one or two months. So in order to get a more stable job, he decided to teach English. However, English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband wanted to seek an advanced degree in English.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'was' instead of 'were' in the sentence 'When we first met, he was a teacher who taught Portuguese.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used 'still taught' instead of 'continued to teach' in the sentence 'After we got married, he still taught Portuguese.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'Sometime' at the beginning of the sentence instead of 'Sometimes'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after the introductory phrase 'After we got married'.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree; you mean he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misunderstanding of the original meaning

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to get a degree about TESOL. He found a distance learning program online which was in California. Therefore, he didn’t have to go to the USA but could get a distant learning. So that after he finished all the courses, he could get the degree. His plain was that with this degree, he could get an English teaching job in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'Therefore, he didn’t have to go to the USA but could get a distant learning.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the specific degree 'TESOL' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the specific location 'California' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the specific method 'distance learning program' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the specific requirement 'finish all the courses' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the specific goal 'get an English teaching job in Taiwan' in the translation

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what kind of the relationship between your husband and the person he had an affair with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇對象' as 'the person he had an affair with' which is a mismatched meaning.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school. The cram school arranges a partner-teaching system, which contains a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher. And she as her partner.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
Then how do you know they had affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'affair' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I noticed that my husband often worked late in cram school. I’ve asked him many times, it was just an English cram school; why would he work so late? And he told me that he had to teach with his partner teacher so he has to cooperate with each other. At first, I trusted him. However, I discovered that he often got phone calls after he got home. And he never answered the phone in front of me; he would go to the study room to answer. This made me start to suspect him, so I checked his phone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the wife checking her husband's phone because of her suspicions.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So did you see any unusual thing in his phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
There was one number that often showed on his dialed record. So I went to check hos text message. After that I found that he texted with a woman nearly every day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was curious and checked the text messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
If it’s was text, then it not a big deal, right? Was the content suspectful?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '就算是发短信' as 'If it's was text', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order, such as 'If it's was text' instead of 'If it was text'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
It’s okay if it was just normal text. However, he is a married man, how could he let a woman to send that kind of message to him. I have provided some of contents to the court. I think it’s in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了' as 'It’s okay if it was just normal text.' The correct translation is 'If it was just a normal text message, it would be fine.' The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about providing some of the contents to the court. The correct translation should include this detail to accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Let’s see page thirteen of the file. Defendant, please check the text content. Are these the text message from your phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對這是我手機裡的簡
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Based on these messages, I will ask you some questions. The first one was sent on at 9:50pm on thirty first in November from number 0958-932xxx, the content was “I really miss you, my love,”…..
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '我真的很想念你，我的愛' as 'I really miss you, my love,' which has a similar meaning but is not an exact translation.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
恩,她是我同事 我記得那個時候我休了兩天假 她很擔心我 所以她才會傳這封簡訊給我 我同事是在美國受教育的 她的思想很開放 這是她說話跟表達的方式  至於{我的愛}只是我們對關心的人的稱謂
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean the one who sent this was westernized because she studied in the United States, right? And she’s more opened in expressing her emotion? So the words ”my love” means nothing right?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
這是對老朋友的一種表達方式而已
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的 她擔心我啊 我們是工作夥伴 我兩天沒有去上班 她當然會想我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她當然會想我，我兩天沒有去上班。'

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean she sent this kind of message to you was just because you didn’t go to work for two days? Without your assistance in class, and she missed you? Is that all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the person missed the user due to their absence from work.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對阿 就這樣啊 沒什麼大不了的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'no big deal', the user's translation says 'nothing serious'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, then the second text was sent at 11:55pm on January 13th in 2013 from the same cellphone, the content was 「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」, can you tell me what this meant
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這封簡訊給我是要教我中文作業要怎麼表達
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean the reason why she sent this to you was to help you with your assignment? What is that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太說的 我在進修 要得到學位的話我必須要休30個學分 而當然我就有一些作業跟練習
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我太太說的，我在進修。要得到學位的話，我必須要休30個學分。而當然，我就有一些作業跟練習。'

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what you are studying in your master program?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我修的是英語教學 在這個學位中 有一部份是英語教學 也有文化語言能力的部分
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '學位' which means 'degree' instead of '課程' which means 'courses'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'related to' is translated as '在這個學位中' which means 'in this degree' instead of '與...有關' which means 'related to'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the specific mention of 'TESOL' which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the mention of 'some of the courses' which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the mention of 'English teaching' and 'culture and language competence' which are important details in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation includes the phrase '我修的是' which means 'I studied' but it is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation includes the phrase '有一部份是' which means 'some of it is' but it is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation includes the phrase '英語教學' which means 'English teaching' but it is not necessary to repeat it in the translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation includes the phrase '文化語言能力的部分' which means 'part of culture and language competence' but it is not necessary to include 'part of' in the translation.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you are studying the degree of TESOL, and there are some courses about culture, right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'some' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
inappropriate cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the idiomatic expression 'TESOL' to the target language, which may cause confusion for the reader.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對阿我記得至少三堂課都跟文化溝通有關
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So the so-called culture communication course would give you what kind of assignments?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'assignments' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這種課所給的作業因學生而異 拿我自己來說 我現在在台灣而且想要找一個英語教學的工作 為了要達到我必須要證明我有足夠的語言能力 所以我的作業很多都是中英文句子的轉換
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean because you plan to teach in Taiwan, so have to show your Chinese competent, right? So you have to do some assignment in the course, which contains the translation between Chinese and English, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對阿 我也需要加強我的口說及寫作能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So back to the previous sentence, this was your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿 我還記得這句 當我看到這個中文的時候 不知道英文怎麼多 你知道中文字對外國人來說很難辨別 我需要一點幫助 所以我才請我同事幫我 我叫他幫我翻譯然後把答案傳給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of asking the colleague to translate the sentence.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean the condition at that time was that you gave the Chinese sentence to your co-worker and asked her to tell you in English, right? That is, the content in the text was just the answer for your assignment, righ
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對 這封簡訊就只是我作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
And now please check page 14 to 16, the evidence one. Please check the content. Were these all because of your assignment?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of what content to check on pages 14 to 16.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對 所有的簡訊都是為了幫助我完成作業才傳的
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, about the law suit which accuse you of having an affair with Wang Tsai-Yen, what’s your explanation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我老婆真的想太多了 我知道他對我負擔家計的程度感到不滿 我想讓法院知道的是 他對於我要進修沒有表示任何的支持 他不願意幫助我完成學業 如果他願意幫助我的話 我就不用請我同事來幫我了 我覺得他對於這些誤會應該要負全部的責任
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'wife' as '他' instead of '她'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form '想' instead of '想要'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'ability of supporting the family'

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, there seems to be some unhappy things between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚的時候 真的很開心 但是問題是我的工作 我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文 可是卻沒有辦法獲得足夠的工作時數 所以我的工作就變成我們兩個之間的問題 我們為此一直吵架 他不相信我有努力 而且他對於我的挫折還有困境完全不了解
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '剛結婚的時候 真的很開心' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '剛結婚的時候，我們真的很開心'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '他不相信我有努力'. The correct form should be '他不相信我有努力過'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我們為此一直吵架' is a mismatched meaning. The correct translation should be '我們因此經常爭吵'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, then back to the master program. When did you start it? Are you done with it? Did you get the degree yet?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春天開始修這個學位 這是一個兩年的課程 我本來應該要在2012年12月完成 可是我沒有完成因為我還有工作所以沒有足夠的時間寫作業  就像我剛剛說過的 我老婆從來不支持我 我覺得在追求學位的路上很孤單 我就變得很累也很挫折
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我在2010年春天開始修這個學位' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我在2010年春天開始修這個學位'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb '開始' should be past tense to match the English sentence 'I first started'. The correct tense should be '我在2010年春天開始修這個學位'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the program was a two-year program. The correct translation should be '這是一個兩年的課程'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the program should have been finished in December 2012. The correct translation should be '我本來應該要在2012年12月完成'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the user didn't finish the program. The correct translation should be '可是我沒有完成'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the user was working part-time. The correct translation should be '因為我還有工作'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the user didn't have enough time to do course assignments. The correct translation should be '所以沒有足夠的時間寫作業'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the user's wife was not supportive. The correct translation should be '我老婆從來不支持我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the user felt alone in pursuing the degree. The correct translation should be '我覺得在追求學位的路上很孤單'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the user became tired and frustrated. The correct translation should be '我就變得很累也很挫折'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean the course was supposed to a two-year program, and you didn’t finish it, why?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
因為我沒有辦法完成所有的課程要求
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'couldn't' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when was the last registered-semester ended?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個註冊的學期是2101年秋天
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'fall 2012' as '2101年秋天', which is incorrect. '2101' is not the same as '2012'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, if the last day of the semester was 5th December, 2012, there shouldn’t be any further assignments, right? However, the text between you and your colleague proceeded for 6 month after that, why is that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '課程結束' as 'assignments' instead of 'course ends'.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成學位也不代表我不想增進我的語文能力阿 就算我沒有拿到學位我也想要增進我的中文 所以我還是自己繼續念
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我也想要增進我的中文'.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean despite the failing of the course, you still wanted to improve your Chinese ability, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對阿 所以我請我同事幫忙
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'asked' in the sentence, which is an important detail.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague was just like your tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只像我的家教 也是我真心的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不只是我的家教，也是我真心的朋友。'

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有 我有跟他說過要付他錢 可是他拒絕
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, then why would she send text to you at night when it was supposed to sleep? Doesn’t that do beyond the relationship between coworker?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '不辭辛勞' as 'beyond the relationship between coworker'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'doesn't' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以這是為什麼我會說他是一個很好的朋友 他拿自己的時間來教我中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以這是為什麼我會說他是一個很好的朋友，他拿自己的時間來教我中文。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the word 'supportive' which is an important detail in describing the friend.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
對我還在那工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
So does she still work there, too?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
對阿 他也還在那邊工作 可是我們現在不是搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他也還在那邊工作' instead of '對阿 他也還在那邊工作'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, does there any evidence you want to further investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena Wang Tsai-Yen who works at Bo-Yuan cram school as witness. And ask her to elaborate the relationship between them, and the background of those texts.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of Wang Tsai-Yen's testimony.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' after the object 'Wang Tsai-Yen', resulting in incorrect word order.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there any evidence you want to course to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had taken some measures about the relationship between them. And I heard that the cram school tried to persuade her to quit the job. Is it possible to verify it to the cram school?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'company'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'tried' before the subject 'the cram school', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the measures were taken specifically for the relationship between the two individuals.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person being persuaded to quit is Queen Caiyan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the request to verify the situation is directed towards the cram school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? The situation now is that your master program has ended, so it should not be taken as an excuse for the interaction between you and Wang Tsai-Yen. Especially, your interaction was always after 9pm, I think it suspectful. Do you have any evidence that may help you with your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Especially, your interaction was always after 9pm, I think it suspectful.' The correct word order should be: 'Especially, I think it is suspectful that your interaction was always after 9pm.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'suspectful' is not a correct English word. The correct word to use here would be 'suspicious'.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不出法院可以幫我偵查什麼耶 就像我之前說的 我們之間的互動是很單純的 我只是想要增進我的語言能力繼續學中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '想' (want) should come before the subject '我' (I).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'investigate' is translated as '偵查' which means 'investigate' in the sense of criminal investigation. However, in this context, it should be translated as '調查' meaning 'investigate' in a general sense.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the phrase 'on my behalf' which is important for conveying the meaning that the court is investigating for the user.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the phrase 'the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple' which provides important context for the situation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the phrase 'I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese' which explains the user's intention.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the court will set the next court on June 9th in 2014 for witness procedure. Both of you have to be there. If it’s necessary, both of you can have lawyers. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我明白。

是的我知道了

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparing procedure of the adultery case. Yu-Hua Chen file the lawsuit for this case. Because of the intimate relationship between his husband Mr. Anderson and his co-worker. The plaintiff found some intimate messages from his co-worker in his cellphone. Also, Mr. Anderson sometimes has the tele-conferencing with his co-worker, and over-time work in the midnight. The evidence which the plaintiff research are beyond co-worker relationship. Therefore, she filed the lawsuit. Defendant, what’s your plea for your wife’s lawsuit against you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Yu-Hua Chen file the lawsuit for this case.' It should be 'Yu-Hua Chen filed the lawsuit for this case.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'Because of the intimate relationship between his husband Mr. Anderson and his co-worker.' It should be 'Because of the intimate relationship between her husband Mr. Anderson and his co-worker.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'The plaintiff found some intimate messages from his co-worker in his cellphone.' It should be 'The plaintiff has found some intimate messages from her co-worker on his cellphone.'
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence 'Also, Mr. Anderson sometimes has the tele-conferencing with his co-worker.' It should be 'Also, Mr. Anderson sometimes has tele-conferencing with his co-worker.'
grammar and structure	preposition errors	Preposition error in the sentence 'The evidence which the plaintiff research are beyond co-worker relationship.' It should be 'The evidence which the plaintiff researched is beyond a co-worker relationship.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the charge of adultery in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the defendant's wife suspecting him of adultery.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the defendant's response to the lawsuit.

Not guilty, of course.
 我覺得我無罪，當然。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, we mainly discuss the details about the intimate messages. That is mainly for to investigate there is an affair or not, that constitute adultery case. Do both of you understand?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我明白
 I understand.

I understand.
我明白。

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long do you marry to your husband? Do you have kid?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'marry' should be in the past tense to agree with the past tense 'have'. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question does not include the information about having children. It should be 'Do you have any children?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I’ve married to my husband for 4 years but we don’t have kid.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'already' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry to your husband in Taiwan? Or other place?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Is his job teaching Portuguese for past years?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the plural subject 'years'.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
The time we just met, he was a Portuguese teacher. And he still kept teaching Portuguese when we just married. But there’s not many people want to learn Portuguese so his teaching hours was not stable. Sometime the period between jobs would be one or two months. To make the income more stable, he started to teach English. But English is not his mother tongue, he decided to take an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The time we just met' should be 'When we just met'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the period between jobs' should be translated as '課程的間隔期' instead of '工作之間的時間'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband decided to take an advanced degree to teach English.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context that the husband's mother tongue is not English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he wanted to seek an advanced degree, is that mean he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that '進修' means 'seeking an advanced degree' in this context. It actually means 'to further one's studies' or 'to pursue further education'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he need to get a TESOL degree. He found a distance learning from California, U.S. so that he doesn’t need to go to California, U.S. but get the degree by the distance learning program. His plan is to get the English teacher job by the American degree.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '關於英語教學的' as 'TESOL degree' instead of 'degree about English teaching'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the distance learning program being offered by a university in California, U.S.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the information about completing the course requirements through correspondence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention that the degree is a master's degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the information about the purpose of getting the degree, which is to find a job as an English teacher in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention that the degree is specifically for teaching English.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in cram school. They are partner. One is foreign teacher, one is mandarin teacher. The person he has an affair with is the mandarin teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '同事' as 'partner', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person the subject has an affair with is the mandarin teacher.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How do you know' instead of 'How do you know that'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
In the beginning, I just noticed my husband stayed in cram school over-time. I asked him for several times why have to work over-time in English cram school? He told me that he had to communicate with his partner. I didn’t doubt him at the beginning. But I found that he sometimes had some call after he finish his job. He didn’t talk in front of me. He would talk in his study room. That made me start doubting so I went check his phone
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'I asked him for several times why have to work over-time in English cram school?' It should be 'I asked him several times why he had to work over-time in an English cram school?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'cram school' should be translated as '補習班' instead of '美語補習班' to accurately convey the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the husband receives calls after coming home and talks in a separate room, which raises suspicion.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation leaves out the context of the wife checking her husband's phone as a result of her suspicion.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
What’s the unusual in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
There are usually the same number shows up in his phone book. I was so curious so I go check his messages. And I found out that he message with a woman every day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'phone book' is not the correct translation for '通訊紀錄'. It should be translated as 'communication records' or 'call logs'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the person checked the messages specifically because they saw the same phone number in the communication records.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
I don’t think text messages matter. Was there any unusual content?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If that just usual message, that is okay. But he is married, how can he have intimate messages with another woman? I’ve provided some text messages and I think it’s in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '已婚的人' as 'married' instead of 'a married person'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the text messages to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
In the file one, page thirteen. Here are some message content for the defendant. Are those the messages in your phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的這些都是我手機裡的簡訊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I’m going to ask you some questions for the messages. The first messages is 9:50 PM, November thirty-first, 2012, from number 0958932xxx to your cellphone. The content is “我真的很想你，我的愛。” What is that?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事傳給我的啊。我記得我那時候休了兩天假，她那時有點焦慮。所以她才發給我這樣的簡訊。我同事是在美國念過書所以她很開放，那是她表達的方式。至於我的愛這句話，這是我們稱呼我們所在乎的人的方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean she text you because she was westernized for being educated in U.S.? She is more open minded to express, so “my love” doesn’t mean any special?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
沒啊這就只是好朋友老朋友之間互相表達我們很在乎對方。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about former sentence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'former' in the translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我講的 她有點擔心，因為我們是工作上的搭檔啊。當我兩天沒上班她當然會想念我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我講的，她有點擔心，因為我們是工作上的搭檔。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'As I said' in the translation, which is an important detail from the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'When I was away for two days' in the translation, which is an important detail from the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'she naturally missed me' in the translation, which is an important detail from the original text.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean you text you that kind of message just because you had two days off? She missed you because of without you in the class? Just that
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by changing the meaning of the message. The original text suggests that the person sent the message because the sender had two days off, while the user's translation suggests that the person missed the sender because they were not in the class.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊就只是這樣啊。對啊就跟內容講的一樣啊這根本就沒甚麼。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '對啊就只是這樣啊' does not capture the idea of 'no big deal' in the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message is at 23:55 PM, January thirteenth, 2013, from the same number to your phone. The content is “我真的好希望你在我身邊，為什麼我們不能真正的在一起?” What does that mean? Why the content?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'I want you by my side'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'when can we be truly together?'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她之所以會傳給我這樣的簡訊主要是為了表達中文句子。這是我的作業。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment,' the user's translation says 'The reason she sent me this text message is mainly to express Chinese sentences. This is my assignment.'

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean she text you the message just for helping you the assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我老婆告訴庭上的。我開始了這個遠距教學程，在這遠距教學課程裡我得完成30個學分。自然，我需要完成一些功課與習題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我老婆告訴庭上的，我開始了這個遠距教學程。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about attending a Master's program and only mentioned the distance learning aspect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what is your master degree for?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程主要是英語教學。在課程裡，大部分是英語教學的部分，其他則是文化及語言能力相關。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'TESOL' as '英語教學' which means 'English teaching' instead of '英語教學與語言能力' which means 'English teaching and language competence'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'some of the courses' which is an important detail in the original text.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you mean you get the TESOL degree, but there’re some courses about cross-culture communication?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
我記得大概有三棵是關於跨文化溝通課程。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '棵' is used for counting trees, not courses.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What’s the assignment in cross-culture communication courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'kind' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
每個學生的作業都不太一樣，拿我舉例來說，我人在台灣，尋求教師資格，為了顯示我有這個這個能力勝任教師，所以有很多是關於中英語句的翻譯轉換。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the culture and communication courses in their translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'good command of Chinese' as '有這個這個能力勝任教師', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the mention of proving competence in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention that the assignments were for the purpose of reaching the goal of becoming an English teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of the assignments being related to culture and communication courses.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the mention of the assignments being about Chinese-English sentence translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean to get the degree you have to prove that you have Chinese competence, so you have to complete the assignment in the course. And the assignment is to translate sentences? Is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of completing the assignment in the course.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'mean' instead of 'means' in the sentence.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對啊當然，而且我還得加強我的說和寫的能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay let’s back to the former sentence, you said that is your assignment?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'that', so it should be 'that is your assignment?'

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對啊我還記得那句，當我知道中文句子時，我不知道如何變成英文。你懂的，有些中文對外國人而言實在很難分辨差別。我實在需要幫忙所以我找了我的同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯並傳簡訊給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The translation does not capture the idiomatic expression 'recognize the difference' in the original sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the fact that the user asked their colleague to send them the answer via text message.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Your mean you told your colleague that Chinese sentence so she text it into English and send it to you? That’s only the answer to your assignment
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就真的只是作業的答案而已。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Messages in file one, page 14 to 16. Please have a look. Are those message also the help for your assignment?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的所有簡訊都是為了完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So what’s your explanation for your wife said that you have an affair with your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '王彩燕' as 'Tsai-Yen Wang' instead of '彩燕王'.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了。我知道她對於我對家計的幫助一直很不滿意。我必須告訴庭上，從一開始修這門課，她就沒表現任何想支持我的意思。她根本就不想幫助我完成這個學位，如果她表現出她有點想幫助我的樣子，我就不會想請我同事幫助我。我覺得這一切的誤會都得怪她。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'support'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'never shown any support'
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	addition of '我必須告訴庭上'
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	addition of '我覺得'
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	addition of '的樣子'

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
As you just said, there are some unhappy between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
一開始我們剛結婚時的確還滿快樂的，但問題在於我的工作。我試著在台灣交葡萄牙語但我的工時實在太不穩定了。所以我的工作成為我們的大問題，我們為了這個問題一直爭吵，她一直不相信我的努力。我也沒辦法讓她明白我的艱困處境及我的沮喪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '一開始我們剛結婚時的確還滿快樂的' should be '我們剛結婚時的確還滿快樂的一開始'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '交葡萄牙語' is translated as 'teaching Portuguese' instead of 'learning Portuguese'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the protagonist's employment issue causing problems in the relationship.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the frustration and difficult situation faced by the protagonist.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, let’s back to the degree issue. When did your advanced degree start? Did that finished? Did you get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific mention of 'master's program' in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question about whether the degree was finished or not.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question about whether the user got the degree or not.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我大概是2010年春天開始的，這是兩年期的課程。我應該在2012年的12月完成這門課程。但我並沒有如期完成因為我有兼職要做而且我也沒有完成這門課的作業。就像我講的，我老婆一點都不想幫
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我大概是2010年春天開始的' is incorrect. It should be '我大概是在2010年春天開始的'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence '我老婆一點都不想幫'. It should be '我老婆一點都不支持我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the reason for not finishing the program, which is '因為我有兼職要做而且我也沒有完成這門課的作業'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about feeling alone and unsupported in pursuing the degree.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You said that program is for two years, but you didn’t complete, why?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我無法完成所有課程的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'couldn't' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When does the last semester you registered complete?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊在學的最後一個學期事2012年的秋季。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'last' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
 If what you said is true, your semester finished on December fifth, 2012, that you would not have any assignment after that semester, right? But the text messages between
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the text messages between the speaker and their colleagues.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我雖然沒有完成這門課程，但不代表我就不想精進我的語言能力。就算我沒有得到我的學位，我還是想要我的中文能力進步，所以我持續自行學習。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我雖然沒有完成這門課程，但我不代表就不想精進我的語言能力。'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb '想' should be present tense '想要' to match the verb '持續' in the following clause.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about failing the program, which is an important detail in the original text.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean though you didn’t complete the degree, you still want to improve your language competence to make your Chinese more fluently?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order: 'more fluently' should be 'more fluent'

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
是的這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the position that your colleague is your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅是家教也是我的好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有啊我原本想付錢給她但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我原本想付錢給她但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her why she still text you in midnight the bed time for answering your questions? Don’t you think that is beyond the co-worker relationship
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the original text, resulting in a different meaning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我剛剛講過的，她是一個非常支持我的好朋友。她用她自己的時間幫助我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我剛剛講過的，她是一個非常支持我的好朋友。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific subject of teaching, which is 'English'.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的我仍在那邊任教。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is the co-worker, Tsai-Yen Wang still working there, too?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她仍在那邊工作但我們不再是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們不再是搭檔了' instead of '但我們不再是了搭檔'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any person you want to subpoena or investigate any further evidence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena Tsai-Yen Wang, who was the co-worker in BoYuan cram school to clarify the relationship between the defendant and those messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of Tsai-Yen Wang's testimony and the background of the text messages.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'was' instead of 'is' to describe Tsai-Yen Wang's current status as a co-worker.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, do you want the court to investigate for you
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of what the plaintiff wants the court to investigate.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
 I’ve heard that cram school took some action for the relationship between my husband and her. Also I heard the cram school tried to persuade Tsai-Yen Wang to quit. Can we modify it from the cram school?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '該女王彩燕離職一事' as 'the relationship between my husband and her' instead of 'the attempt to persuade Tsai-Yen Wang to quit'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'Can we modify it from the cram school?' instead of 'Can we modify it from the cram school?'

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
 Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you? The situation is, your degree finished on December fifth, 2012. You don’t have any reason to explain the intimate messages between you and Miss Wang. Especially, the message communication is mainly after 9PM, it’s very doubtful. Do you have any evidence which can help you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'your degree finished on December fifth, 2012.' It should be 'your degree finished on December fifth, 2011.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '希望法庭為你調查的事證' as 'do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you?' is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as 'any evidence you hope the court to investigate?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant's master's degree, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'you don’t have any reason to explain the intimate messages between you and Miss Wang.' It should be 'you don’t have any reason to explain the intimate messages between Miss Wang and you.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'the message communication is mainly after 9PM.' It should be 'the communication of messages is mainly after 9PM.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '起人疑竇' as 'it’s very doubtful' is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as 'arouse suspicion.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant's need for evidence to help their case, which is an important detail in the original text.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我覺得我的行為已經夠可以表現出我的清白了。就像我說的，我跟我同事間的簡訊來往是非常單純的。我只是想增進我的中文能力並持續的學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'evidence' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the purpose of the communication, which is to improve language ability and continue learning Chinese.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next date will be set at 4:30PM June ninth, 2014, for the examination procedure. Plaintiff, defendant should show up. If it’s neccesarily, both of you can have a lawyer. Do you understand?

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are her for the preparation of adultery case. The plaintiff, yu wha chen sued the case. The main reason is that her husband John Anderston has intimate messages with his colleague in cram school. The plaintiff checks her husband’ cell phone and found that there are some intimate messages. Moreover, her husband often makes up reasons for working and has tele-conferencing with his colleague chia en Wang. The information collected by the plaintiff is beyond the co-workers’ relationship. So she sued the case. Defendant, your wife sued you of adultery case, what‘s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The plaintiff, yu wha chen sued the case.' It should be 'The plaintiff, Yu Wha Chen, filed the case.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice: 'tele-conferencing' should be 'video calls' or 'video chats'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details: The translation does not mention that the plaintiff suspects her husband of having an affair.

Not guilty, of course.
我當然無罪
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
Today’s purpose of preparation procedure is that we will focus on the detail of messages between the defendant and his colleague. The purpose is to find that whether the defendant and his colleague constitute adultery. Do both parties understand the procedure?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long did you marry your husband? Do you have any child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'did' should be changed to 'have' to match the subject 'you'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question does not include the information about having children.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I have been married him for 4 years, we don’t have any child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should be in the past tense to agree with the subject 'I'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user's husband.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the word 'already' to indicate the duration of the marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should be in the past tense to agree with the subject 'we'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the word 'any' to indicate the absence of children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you and your husband marry in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
My husband and I have known each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan for the purpose of teaching Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'My husband and I met in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker and their husband met in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the husband came to Taiwan specifically to teach Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
For the past few years, is his job of teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we just met, he is a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he still teaches Portuguese. But there are few people learning Portuguese, his teaching hours are unstable. Sometimes, there is one or two months which is a period between jobs. In order to reach a stable financial status, he wants to start to teach English. But his mother tongue is not English, he decided to seek advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'When we just met, he is a Portuguese teacher' should be 'When we just met, he was a Portuguese teacher' to match the past tense of 'just met'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the husband's decision to teach English is because his mother tongue is not English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree, did you mean that he wants to further study in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the person wants to study in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he needs to get some degrees of teaching English. He found a distance learning program from California on internet.  He can finish his course requirement by distance learning and he doesn’t need to go to America. After he finished the entire course, he can get the master degree. His plan is to get this degree of American course, and he can teach English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'No. he wants to teach English in Taiwan' should be 'No, he wants to teach English in Taiwan'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'He can finish his course requirement by distance learning and he doesn’t need to go to America.' The verb 'doesn't' should agree with the subject 'he', so it should be 'he doesn't need to go to America.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'After he finished the entire course, he can get the master degree.' The verb 'finished' should be in the past tense, so it should be 'After he finishes the entire course, he can get the master degree.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence: 'He found a distance learning program from California on internet.' The original text mentions that he found a distance learning program from a specific university in California, but this detail is missing in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence: 'His plan is to get this degree of American course, and he can teach English in Taiwan.'

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇對象' as 'the person he has an affair with' which is a mismatched meaning.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleague in cram school. The cram school arranges them to be the partner. My husband partner with her in teaching.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'partner' should agree with the subject 'My husband' in number.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I just noticed that my husband often extra-work in cram school. I have asked him several times that if it is an English cram school, did you really need to extra-work. He told me that because he needs to partner with the Chinese teacher in English teaching, he has to stay in cram school late for extra work. At t he beginning, I didn’t suspect him. But later I found out that after he came back home, he often pick some phone calls. After he picks up phone call, he didn’t talk on the phone in front of me, and go to the study room to talk with somebody. That makes me suspect him of some affairs, so I check his phone book.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in 'extra-work in cram school' should be 'work extra hours in a cram school'.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find any problems in cell phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his record, I saw the same number on the phone book. I am curious about who she or he is, I check his messages. After I check his messages, I found out that he send the messages with the same woman almost every day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'phone book' instead of 'record'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is a man.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
If they are only sending messages, is that any problems or is the detail unusual?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they are the normal messages, that is fine. He is married, how can he make her send some intimated messages. I provide the court some messages on the phone. It should be in the fold.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的簡訊' as 'normal messages' instead of 'ordinary text messages'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the court with the messages and the fact that they should be in the folder.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please show the page 13. There are some messages, defendant please check the messages. Are these the detail in your cell phone messages?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific page number and the fact that the messages are in question.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context that the messages are being presented as evidence in a court case.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的,這些是我的手機簡訊

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I am going to ask you some questions based on these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50 p.m on November 31th ,2012. It was sent by 0958-932-***. The text is that I really fix your love. What does that mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那是從我同事傳的,我記得我請兩天假,他有點擔心我.這就是為什麼他傳這簡訊給我.我的同事是在美國受教似的,所以他非常開放.這是他說話跟表達的方式,至於愛是他表達對我的關心而以.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural expression

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Did you mean that the sender is educated in America, so she is westernized, right? She expresses the feelings open-minded right? So the meaning of my love is nothing, right?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然沒有阿,這是兩個很好的朋友表達關心的方式
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation misinterprets the cultural context of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
What about the last two sentences she just mentioned?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the last two sentences mentioned by the speaker.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的他只是很擔心我,我們是工作上的同事.我請假兩天.他當然會擔心我.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean that because you are two day off, your colleague worry about you, she send the message, right? Because she didn’t partner with you in English teaching, she miss you, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the colleague is worried about the user and misses them.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對那就是內容阿,根本沒有什麼
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent at 11:55p.m January 13th .2012. it is sent by the same cell phone. The detail is that I want you by my side, when can we be truly together? Can you tell me why do you have that kind of message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他寫這句話是想要我知道中文的意思
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Did you mean that she sent the messages for helping you finish your homework?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛說的,我正在上一些課。我必須要完成30哥學分才算是結束。當然我就必須要完成一些功課阿。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of attending a Master's program in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of needing to complete assignments and exercises in their translation.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain that what did you learn in Master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是英語教學，在那樣的課程裡，有些是英文教學的課程，有些是文化以及語言表達的課程。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' instead of '計畫' or '方案'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'TESOL' is translated as '英語教學' instead of '英語教學碩士課程'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我的課程是英語教學，有些是英文教學的課程，有些是文化以及語言表達的課程。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'some of the courses' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'related to English teaching' and 'related to culture and language competence' in the original text.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you mean that you are getting the master degree of TESOL. There are some cultural and communication courses, right
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'getting' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'of TESOL' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user used a more informal tone in the translation by using 'you mean' instead of 'so you mean'.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對阿，我記得至少有三堂課跟文化與溝通課程有關係的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What’s your assignment of this kind of course you mentioned?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'assignment' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這堂課的功課是根據每個學生不同而定的，拿我來說，我在台灣是想尋求一個應予教學的學位，為了拿到這個學位，跟足夠的語言能力，我必須知道如何表達。所以我有很多功課是中文英文之間的翻譯功課。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Did you mean that you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have get some courses to prove that you have the Chinese language competence, right? So you have to finish the assignment in the courses which is sentences translation, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of completing assignments as part of the course requirements.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
當然阿，我有時後還必須要潤飾我的作文還有口說能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Then we go back to the sentence we just mention. Is this sentence your homework?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我還記得這句話。當我拿到這句中文的時候，我不知怎麼翻。你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說項天書一樣。我需要一些幫忙，所以請我同事幫忙。我告訴他我需要幫忙，所以請他幫我翻譯然後回傳答案給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '項天書' is translated as 'like a heavenly book' which is not accurate.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the translation of the sentence that was asked for.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that your colleague translated the sentence into Chinese and send it back to you, is that what you mean? That is to say, the detail of message is just assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是我的功課罷了。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now we are going to show you that the details on page14 to 16. Please check the content. Is that just because you need to finish your homework, you ask your colleague for help, right?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，所有的簡訊都是為了完成我的功課。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
For your wife suspect you of having affair with yu chia Wang, what’s your explanation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的是想太多了，我知道他對我沒辦法養一個家不是很滿意。我想告訴法庭的是，在我開始想學課程的時候，他沒有給我任何支持。他並沒有給我任何幫助完成學業。如果他可以給我多一點支持或幫助的話，我就不需要問我同事拉。我覺得他需要為所有的誤會負責。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of pronouns

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you just said, is there any quarrel between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在結婚一開始的時候，我們當然過得很開心阿。問題在於….。我試著想要在台灣交葡萄牙文，但教課十束真的很不穩定。我的工作問題就變成我們的大問題。我們常常為了這件事在吵架。他根本不相信我其實進了我最大的努力。我沒辦法讓他知道我所面臨的挫折跟處境。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok, let’s back to the master degree courses you just mentioned. When did you start your courses? Did you finish the course and get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春天開始。他是兩年的課程。我應該是在2012年12月就要完成我的課程。我沒有修完課程，因為我還要打工兼職。而且我沒有時間作作業。就像我太太說的，我太太一直都不是很支持我做這件事，我覺得我是一個人為了學業在奮鬥。我覺得我很累而且很綽折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我在2010年春天開始' should be '我在2010年春天開始了' to indicate completion of the action.

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'and' in the translation of '而且我沒有時間作作業' (and I didn't have time to do my course assignments).

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that the course is two year period, and you didn’t finish the course, can you tell me why?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有完成課業的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When did the semester end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個學期是在2012年的秋天。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我最後一個學期是在2012年的秋天。'

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
Based on what you just said, your semester ended on December 12th ,2012. You should not any assignment after the semester, right? But you and your colleague still send the messages to each other for six months after the semester ended. Can you tell me why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the date of the semester's end.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the correct date of the semester's end.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我或許是沒有完成學業，但不代表我不想增進我的語言能力。就算我沒有完成學業，沒有拿到碩士學位，我還是想增進我的能力，所以我才繼續傳簡訊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Did you mean that even though you didn’t finish your master degree, you still want to improve your language ability, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為什麼要找我同事幫忙。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'asked' from the original text, resulting in the omission of the action of asking for help.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
Did you mean that your colleague is like your tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是一個家教，而且他是一個很好的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her money?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you pay her money?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
我本來要付錢給他，可是他拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The subject and object are reversed.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you don’t pay her money, why did she still send the messages at midnight for helping you answer the question? Is that beyond the co-workers relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我說的，他是一個非常支持我的朋友。他總會用他自己的時間教我中文。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'she' is changed to '他' (he), causing a subject-verb agreement error.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'supportive' is translated as '支持' (support), which doesn't convey the same meaning as 'help' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The phrase 'to help me learn Chinese' is omitted in the translation.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does your colleague cia uin Wang also serving as a teacher in the cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
他還在那工作，但我們不再是伙伴的關係了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們不再是伙伴的關係了' instead of '但我們不再是伙伴的關係了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any evidence need to investigate or subpoena any witness?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you have any witnesses or evidence that need to be further investigated or subpoenaed?'

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to sopena the colleague, working for the bo yun cram school, cia yun Wang as witness to the court. I want to ask her why she sends these messages and the purpose of doing so.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the relationship between the defendant and the witness, as well as the background and purpose of the text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'sopena' before the object 'the colleague', which is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I want to sopena cia yun Wang, the colleague working for the bo yun cram school, as a witness to the court.'

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school takes some actions to solve the relationship between them. They try to encourage the colleague to quit the job. I want to know if the court asks the cram school to prove that.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女王彩燕' as 'colleague' instead of 'Queen Caiyan'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'asks' before the subject 'court', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the actions taken by the cram school to solve the relationship.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the court's involvement in the situation.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? The situation is that your master degree has ended on December 5th .2012. There is no reason for you to explain the interaction of you and your colleague; especially you often send the messages after 9 o’clock. That’s really wear. Do you have any evidence to prove your innocence
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'That’s really wear' is incorrect. It should be 'That's really weird.'

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today, we are here for the preparation procedure for the case of adultery. The defendant, YuHua Chen filed this case. She filed this case mainly because her husband, John Anderston, has the intimate relationship with his co-worker in the cram school. She found some intimate message in her husband’s cell phone. Moreover, her husband often makes up reasons for working so he can have the time with his co-worker, Cai Yan Wang. The defendant searched the message between her husband and the colleague is not the normal relationship about friends. As a result, the defendant filed this case. Plaintiff, your wife sued you with the crime of adultery, what do you have to say?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, defendant, how long has you married with your husband? Do you have any kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant being the one asking the question.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years and we do not have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or in other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We knew each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and he mainly what to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past few years, did the husband teach Portuguese in Taiwan, is this his job?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Was his job teaching Portuguese in Taiwan in the past few years?'

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first knew each other, he was the Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not quite popular in Taiwan so the teaching hours of my husband is not very much. And there might be the period between two jobs in one to two months. Then, because he wanted to have the more concrete salaries so he started teaching English. However, he is not a native speaker of English so he seeks for advance degree in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And there might be the period between two jobs in one to two months.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'of my husband' in the sentence: 'the teaching hours of my husband is not very much.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'so he started teaching English' in the sentence: 'Then, because he wanted to have the more concrete salaries.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'so he seeks for advance degree in Taiwan' in the sentence: 'However, he is not a native speaker of English.'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he decided to have the advanced degree, do you mean that he want to have a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the person wants to have a degree in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wants to teach English in Taiwan so the advanced education is for the English teaching. He found the distance learning program which was provided from the California in America. In this way, he can finish the online program without going to the foreign country. In this way, after he finishes all the credits, he can get the master degree. He planned to find the English teach position after he gets the master degree of English teaching.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '取得的學位是關於英語教學的' as 'the advanced education is for the English teaching', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the sentence 'He wants to teach English in Taiwan so the advanced education is for the English teaching'. The correct word order should be 'He wants to teach English in Taiwan, so the education he needs to obtain is related to English teaching'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the distance learning program is provided by a university in California. This detail is important for understanding the context of the story.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation also omits the information that the program is completed through correspondence, which is important for understanding how the protagonist plans to obtain the degree without going to the US.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention the protagonist's plan to find a teaching job in Taiwan after obtaining the master's degree in English teaching.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So, what is the relationship between your husband and the person he had an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are the co-worker in the cram school. In that cram school, they arranged a Chinese teacher to partner with the foreign teacher. And that woman is my husband’s partner.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '他班上的中師' as 'my husband's partner', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know there is an affair between them?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How do you know', but it should be translated as 'How do you know there is'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I just noticed that my husband often stay in the cram school for extra working. I asked my husband many times why you have to work extra time because it is just an English cram school. He told me that because he had to partner with the Chinese teacher, they have to communicate many details. At first, I really didn’t suspect him; however, I found that he often got some calls after he returned home. When he got the phone call, he didn’t get it in front of me and he even went to the study room to pick the phone call. Then, I was doubtful for it so I check his cell phone.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'why you have to work extra time because it is just an English cram school.' The correct word order should be 'why do you have to work extra time because it is just an English cram school.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the husband stays at the cram school after work. The original text states '我先生常常會留在學校加班' which translates to 'my husband often stays at the school to work overtime.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the husband receives phone calls after returning home. The original text states '他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話' which translates to 'he often receives phone calls after returning home.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the husband goes to the study room to answer the phone calls. The original text states '還會特地到書房去講' which translates to 'he even goes to the study room to talk.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the wife becomes suspicious and checks her husband's cell phone. The original text states '這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機' which translates to 'This made me start to suspect. So I checked his cell phone.'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So, did you find some unusual message in the cell phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In the records, I found the same number so I was very curious and I go to check his message box. After my checking, I found that my husband send message to the same woman almost every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '查他的簡訊' as 'check his message box' instead of 'check his messages'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband and the woman are sending messages to each other.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
I think the message is acceptable, is there any unappropriated words?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the appropriateness of the content

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it is just the normal language then I can just ignore it. However, my husband is married, how could he let that woman send some intimate to him? I provide some intimate records to the court, I think they are in the investigate file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '很親密的字句' as 'intimate records' instead of 'intimate words or phrases'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the intimate records to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please check the investigate file one page thirteen. Plaintiff, please read it, here are some messages from your cell phone. Are these messages from your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
沒錯，這是我手機上的簡訊。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I want to ask you some questions about the message. The first message was sent from number 0958-932-XXX, and this message was sent at nine-fifty p.m. November twelve, 2012. And the content is “I really miss you, my love,” What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect date and time interpretation

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
恩這是我一個同事傳給我的，我記得我那時請了兩天的假，她有點擔心我的狀況，所以她才傳給我這個簡訊。我同事在美國讀過書所以她也比較開放。她就是這樣子講話來表達自己的情感的。至於那句”my love”，那只是我們叫彼此之間的方式罷了。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that because your co-work has ever received education in America so she might be westernized? So…she might be open-mind to express her thoughts? So, as to “my love”, there isn’t any meaning behind it?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of being westernized and assumes it means being open-minded in expressing thoughts.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression '我的愛' (my love) in the target language.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
不是啊，那就只是一個詞來稱呼好朋友罷了。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original expression, which is a common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the prior sentence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the translation of the prior sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛說的啊，她很擔心我，我們又是工作上的搭檔。當我請了兩天的假，她當然會很想我啊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So the co-work sent to such a message only because you had two day off for the work? Without your assistance of teaching, she miss you? That’s all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，就這樣子而已，那簡訊沒什麼啦。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the informal tone of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Ok, let’s see the next text message, also sent from the same cell phone, sent at nine fifty p.m. January thirteenth 2013. The content is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” How about this message? Why did she send such message to you?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '23點55分' as 'nine fifty p.m.' instead of 'eleven fifty-five p.m.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the date '中華民國102年1月13日' in the translation.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這簡訊給我是要教我怎麼樣寫我中文課的一個作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她傳這簡訊給我' instead of '她傳這簡訊給我是'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the message is about expressing a Chinese sentence in the assignment.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Do you mean that your co-worker send you such a text message is to help your homework?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛說的，我正在接受碩士的進修課程。在那個課程中，我必須要修完30個學分才能得到這個學位，那當然啊，我必須要完成指定的作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '剛剛說的' should come after the subject '我太太'.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you explain that what kind of education are you receiving now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位是英語教學，這個課程一部分是在上英語教學，而其他部分主要是在上有關文化和溝通方面的事物。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
Do you mean that you are receiving for the English teaching master degree but there is some culture communication programs in that case?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得至少有3個學分和文化溝通有關吧。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我記得至少有3個學分和文化溝通有關。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '學分' is translated as 'credit' instead of 'course'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What kinds of assignments are given for the culture and communication?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'assignments' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
文化溝通課程的作業是因人而異的，舉我的例子來說，我在台灣然後我又想當一位英文老師，為了成為英文老師，我必須有足夠的中文能力，因此我的作業大多是和中英文翻譯有關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Do you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, this program ask you to show the good Chinese competence? As a result, you have to finish the assignments given by the program, and the assignments are about translations.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of completing the assignments as part of the program.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，我也被要求要訓練好我的口說和寫作的能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, let’s go back to the words you said, is this your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對啊沒錯，我記得那句話，當我拿到這份英文作業時，我不知道怎樣用英文表達，你也知道，對外國人來說，中文字是很難的，我需要幫助所以我請我的同事來幫我。我請她幫我翻譯之後再傳簡訊告訴我。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Because you ask your co-worker to translate, she sent you the Chinese answer. Is this what you mean? That is to say, the message is only the answer to the assignment, do you mean this?

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對啦，那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now, we check the investigate file one page fourteen to sixteen, please read it. Did your co-worker send you all these messages only to help you with your assignment?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific request to read the investigate file and focused only on the purpose of the messages.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，所有簡訊都只是要完成我的作業
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of the purpose of the messages being for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
How do you explain about your wife’s suing that there is the unusual relationship between you and your co-worker, Cai Yan Wang?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的是想太多了，我知道她一直對我沒辦法養這個家一直很不滿意，我希望法院知道的是，我太太在我開始進修的期間從來沒有支持過我，她根本不想幫助我，然後讓我得到這個學位，如果她願意幫助我的話，我就不會去找我的同事來幫我了，我覺得她才應該因為這些誤解來被譴責。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我太太真的是想太多了' (My wife really thinks too much). The correct word order should be '我太太真的想太多了'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我知道她一直對我沒辦法養這個家一直很不滿意' (I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family). The verb '對' (is) should agree with the subject '她' (she), so it should be '她一直對我沒辦法養這個家一直很不滿意'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence '我希望法院知道的是' (I want the court to know that). The verb '知道' (know) should be in the present tense to match the verb '希望' (want), so it should be '我希望法院知道的是'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我太太在我開始進修的期間從來沒有支持過我' (She has never shown any support from the very beginning of my study). The correct word order should be '我太太從來沒有在我開始進修的期間支持過我'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '她根本不想幫助我，然後讓我得到這個學位' (She was not willing to help me, and then let me get this degree). The correct word order should be '她根本不想幫助我，然後讓我得到這個學位'.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you just say, it seems that there are some unpleasant relationship between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們剛結婚時，我們的確過得很愉快，但問題在於我的工作，我想在台灣教葡萄牙語但是工作卻不穩定，於是，我的工作問題成為我們兩個之間不佳關係的導火線，我們因為我工作的問題已經吵架很多次了。她不相信我已經盡力了，她也不能理解我所遇到的沮喪或是困難。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們剛結婚時，我們的確過得很愉快' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們的確在剛結婚時過得很愉快'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So, let’s go back to the master degree you just mentioned. When did your master degree start, did your master degree finish, did you get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春天開始上這個課，這是兩年的課程，我應該在2012年12月得到學位，我沒有得到學位是因為我必須兼職而我沒有時間好好寫我得作業。就像我剛剛說的，我太太對我沒有很支持，我覺得我修這個課的時侯都只是靠自己的努力。我覺得很累也很難過。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我在2010年春天開始上這個課' (I started this course in Spring 2010). The correct word order should be '我在2010年春天開始上這個課程'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '我應該在2012年12月得到學位' (I should have finished the program in December 2012). The correct tense should be '我應該在2012年12月完成學位'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我沒有得到學位是因為我必須兼職而我沒有時間好好寫我得作業' (I didn't get the degree because I had to work part-time and didn't have enough time to do my assignments). The correct word order should be '我沒有得到學位是因為我必須兼職而我沒有時間好好寫我的作業'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
Since the course is a two-year course, why didn’t you finish this course?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成課程的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When did the last registration finish?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一次註冊的時間是2012年秋天。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'semester', which is an important detail in the original text.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If what you just said are true, then after your last semester of registration, which was on December twelve, 2012, so, after this date, you should not have any assignments, right? But the messages between you and your co-worker were keep send even after six months.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific date of the last semester's end.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific date of the last semester's end.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'were keep send' instead of 'were kept sending'.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然我沒有修完碩士課程但這並不代表說我不想要繼續增強我的中文能力。雖然我沒有修完課程，但是我還是想要繼續自學增強我的中文能力。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of failing the program in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '但這並不代表說' (but it doesn't mean) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '我沒有修完碩士課程' (I didn't finish the master's program).
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the past tense '修完' (finished) instead of the present tense '想要繼續' (want to continue) to express the desire to improve their Chinese ability.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '但是我還是' (but I still) which is not present in the original text.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Even though you didn’t finish the course, you still want to improve your Chinese competence and make your Chinese more fluently? Do you mean this?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Do you mean this?'

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
沒錯，所以我才請我同事幫我的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your co-worker played as your tutor for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅是我的家教也是我的好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾提議要付薪水給她但她婉拒了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾提議要付薪水給她，但她婉拒了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she send you such a message at the midnight, the time people should be sleeping, why did she pay so much effort to help you? Is this kind of helping over the relationship between co-workers?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我說的啊，她是很願意幫助我的人，她花盡所有的時間來教導我中文。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'supportive' as 'willing to help' which changes the meaning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '教導' (teach) before the object '我中文' (me Chinese), which is incorrect.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach at that cram school now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Do you still teach English at that cram school now?'

Yes, I am still working there.
對我還在那工作。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我還在那工作。' instead of '對我還在那工作。'

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
How about your co-worker? Did she still work there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那工作和我們沒有再一起教課了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '和我們沒有再一起工作了' instead of '和我們沒有再一起教課了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutors, is there any evidence you want to investigate or witness you want to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena the co-worker who works at the 伯元cram school, whom is Cai Yan Wang, I want her to come here as the witness. I want to her to come here and explain the relationship between her and the plaintiff, also, I want to hear her explanations about the background of those messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant and referred to the plaintiff instead.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'whom' instead of 'who' in the sentence.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the purpose of the co-worker's testimony.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the background of the messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Defendant, do you have any further evidence that you want the court to help you investigate?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff as the person being asked about any evidence.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has some action about the relationship between my husband and the co-worker. The cram school also tried to persuade the woman to quit the job. I want to know if the court can confirm this issue or not.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	補習班 (cram school) should be 當事人 (parties involved)
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	彩燕 (Cai Yan) should be 該女王 (the queen)
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court in their translation

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Plaintiff, do you have anything you want the court to help you investigate? Your course has already finished on November fifth 2012. Actually, you do not have the reasons to have the action between you and your co-worker because your course has already finished. And the interactions between both parties’ messages are sent after nine p.m. and it is quite suspectful. Do you have any evidence which may help you with your case?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '被告' as 'plaintiff' instead of 'defendant'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Plaintiff' at the beginning of the sentence instead of the end.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's name '王彩燕' in the translation.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我現在沒有想到任何法院可以幫助我調查的證據，就像我剛剛說的，我和同事之間的互動都沒什麼，我只是想要增進我的語言能力並且持續不斷的學中文。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of wanting to improve their language ability and continue learning Chinese.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court date will be set at four thirty p.m. June ninth 2014, we will meet here for the preparation for witness. Both parties please come here on at date. If it is necessary, you can have your lawyer.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today, here we are for the preparatory procedure for case of adultery. The plaintiff , Wu-Wha Chen, accused this case. The reason is that her husband, John Anderston, goes too close to his academic school co-worker. The plaintiff found some intimate messages in the defendant’s mobile phone. Further, the defendant will have more work after the job and he also had tele-conferencing with Cai Yan Wang after the work. The content that the plaintiff collected is beyond the co-worker’s relationship in this case. As a result, the plaintiff has this case. The defendant, what’s your plea that your wife thinks you have an affair.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: 'Today, here we are for the preparatory procedure for case of adultery.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice: 'goes too close' instead of 'has a close relationship'

Not guilty, of course.
當然沒有這回事阿
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
The main purpose of today’s preparatory procedure is that we want to know the details that the defendant connects with the woman. The purpose is that we want to know if the defendant has the adultery with his co-worker. Do both parties know the procedure?

我明白
Yes, I know.

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
How long do you marry with your husband? Do you have kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the word 'you' before 'marry'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the word 'for' before 'how long'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the word 'have' before 'kids'.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have got married for four years and we don’t have kids.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense should be present perfect instead of simple past.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Do you get married with your husband in Taiwan or in foreign countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you get married with your husband in Taiwan or in foreign countries?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met up in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan in order to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is the one who learned Portuguese, not the husband.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Did he teach Portuguese as work in the past few years?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'teach' should agree with the subject 'he', so it should be 'Did he teach' instead of 'Did he teaches'.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
In the beginning, he was a Portuguese teacher when we first met. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan so his teach hour is not stable. Sometimes, he has two months as a period between jobs. Later, in order to have a stable work, he tries to teach English. But his mother tongue is not English, so he wants to seek an advantage degree for English.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'his teach hour is not stable' should be 'his teaching hours are not stable'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'Sometimes, he has two months as a period between jobs' should be 'Sometimes, he has a two-month period between jobs'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'Later, in order to have a stable work, he tries to teach English' should be 'Later, in order to have stable work, he tried to teach English'.
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	Article error in the sentence: 'But his mother tongue is not English, so he wants to seek an advantage degree for English' should be 'But his mother tongue is not English, so he wants to seek an advanced degree in English'.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You said that he wants to seek an advantage degree. Is that mean he wants to have a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advantage' instead of 'pursue further studies'.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user did not accurately understand the meaning of '進修' in the context of education in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he wants to get the degree about teaching English. He finds a distance learning program from California, America on the Internet. He can use the way of on-line learning instead of going to America to finish his learning. So that after he gets every credit, he can finish his graduate degree. His plan is: because his graduate degree, he can find some jobs about teaching English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'because his graduate degree' should be 'because of his graduate degree'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the distance learning program is offered by a university in California.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the information that the program is a distance learning program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention that the program is for teaching English.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user skipped the information that the program is for obtaining a graduate degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the detail that the program allows him to complete the requirements through correspondence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the information that he can obtain a master's degree after completing all the credits.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention that the purpose of obtaining the degree is to find a job as an English teacher in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user skipped the information that the degree is from an American university.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the detail that he can complete the program without going to America.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-worker in cram school. The cram school has Chinese teachers and English teachers. So the woman partners with my husband. She is a Chinese teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '他班上的中師' as 'She partners with my husband' instead of 'She is a Chinese teacher'.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
In the beginning, I found my husband often stayed in the cram school late. I asked for several times that why he needed work more because it is just a cram school. He told me that because he needed to partner with Chinese teacher so he needed to communicate with Chinese teacher frequently. I didn’t doubt him in the beginning. But later I found he had some phone calls after he came home. He never answers the phone in front of my face. He just went to the study room to answer the phone call. What I said made me feel confused and I try to check his phone.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'What I said made me feel confused and I try to check his phone.' It should be 'What I said made me feel confused, so I tried to check his phone.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the protagonist checked her husband's phone because she became suspicious.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you see something unusual in his mobile phone?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the singular verb 'Did' instead of the plural verb 'Did you' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
His calling record showed a number that frequently shown on the phone. I was very curious and I tried to search his messages. After I searched, I found that he contacted with a woman almost everyday.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the phone number belonged to a woman.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Just the text messages is ok I think. Is there any unusual message, unusual word in the message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If the message is normal, that’s ok. But he is a person who got married, how can he deliver intimate messages. Previously I provided some contents of the messages. I think they are n the files of the court.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '讓對方發一些很親密的字句' as 'deliver intimate messages', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
The investigatory file, page thirteen. There are several contents of the messages. Defendant, please check them. Are they the messages from your mobile phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是，他們是我手機裡的簡訊內容。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'message on my cell phone' as '簡訊內容' which means 'message content' instead of '手機裡的簡訊' which means 'message on my cell phone'.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I want to ask you some questions according to the messages. The first message is come from the phone number, 0958932xxx, and the date is 9:50 pm, November 31st in 2012. The context is that: 我真的很喜歡你，我的愛人。 What that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那我一個同事傳的，我記得那天我兩天休假，她有點擔心，這就是為什麼她傳給我這個簡訊。我的同事是在美國受教育的，她的心胸比較開闊。那是她說話已集展現自我的方式。說「我的愛人」那是我們關心在乎的人的方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You meant the person who sent you this message stayed in foreign country before so that she was westernized. And her expression for her feeling is more open so the words “my love” don’t mean other meaning, right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of 'westernized' and its impact on the person's expression of feelings.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿，那在很重視彼此的平常的朋友裡是很常見的字。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我所說的，她只是擔心我，我們是工作上的同事。我那兩天請假的時候她真的很想我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我那兩天請假的時候'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'naturally' is not accurately translated. It should be translated as '真的' or '自然地' instead of '只是'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You meant the woman delivered this message is because you didn’t work for two days? Is that right? Because she didn’t have your cooperation in the class so she missed you? Is that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
沒錯那就是整個內容阿，這簡訊沒什麼大不了。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'no big deal', the user's translation says 'not a big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message, which is delivered from the same mobile phone numbers, is delivered at 11:45 pm, on January thirteen in 2013. the message is that: 我真的很想跟你在一起，我們什麼時候才能做到呢?我們何時才能在一起呢? What the sentence mean? Why do you have such a message in your mobile phone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她告訴我這個句子是因為她想告訴我怎麼樣在中文裡表達這個意思。因為這個是在我的作業裡面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You said that the woman delivered this message to you is because she wants to help you with your assignment. What is that meant?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就是有一個英語教學的時候，我老婆在打這場官司的時候。在那個課程裡我需要得到三十學分，這樣我才能完成我的學程。所以我要完成一些作業和課業上的功課。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '教學' is translated as 'teaching' instead of 'program'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我老婆在打這場官司的時候' is incorrect. It should be '我在打這場官司的時候，我老婆告訴了法庭'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the assignments and exercises that needed to be completed.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation lacks the appropriate level of formality and politeness required in a court setting.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Please explain your graduate degree. What are doing in the program?

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的計畫是英語教學。在那個課程裡有些部分事關於英語教學的部分，有些是有文化以及語言能力的課程
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '計畫' instead of '課程'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'TESOL' is not translated correctly and its meaning is not conveyed accurately.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The phrase 'some of the courses' is omitted in the translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The phrase 'In that program' is added in the translation, which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The phrase 'and others were related to culture and language competence' is added in the translation, which is not present in the original text.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So, your program is for English teaching graduate program and in that program it also has some culture learning courses. Is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少有三堂課關於文化與溝通的課。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the singular verb 'is' instead of the plural verb 'were' to agree with the plural noun 'courses'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'related' instead of 'about' to describe the courses.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What the assignment in this culture communication courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'kind' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'in' before the subject 'this culture communication courses', which is incorrect.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這文化溝通課程可能因每位學生狀況不同而因人而異。以我做為例子:我在台灣試著找一個教英文的工作。為了正明我有這個能力擔任這個職務，我必須在中文上有一定的語言能力。因此很多給我的作業是有關中英的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這文化溝通課程可能因每位學生狀況不同而因人而異。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the user seeking a teaching position as an English teacher. The correct translation should include this detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the user needing to prove their competence in Chinese. The correct translation should include this detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the user's assignments being about Chinese-English sentence translation. The correct translation should include this detail.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You said because you want to teach English in Taiwan, in the program, you need to prove that you have a certain Chinese competence. You need to finish some assignment in the program and the assignment is about translating Chinese. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯阿，而且我還被要求要針對我的口說和寫作能力來磨練磨練。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok. Let’s come back the sentence before what I said. Is that your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is that your assignment?' instead of 'Is that your assignment, right?'

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿，我記得那句話。當我拿到一些中文句子的時候我不知道怎麼用英文表達。你知道的，有些中文字對外國人來說是很難辨認的，我需要一些幫助所以我請我的同事來幫我 我請她幫我翻譯那個句子並且寄簡訊來告訴我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You meant you asked your colleague to translate the Chinese into English. So she delivered that message to you. Is that the situation happened? You meant this message is just the answer of the assignment.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那簡訊就真的只是我功課的答案而已。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
The message in our investigatory file between the pages number 14 to 16. Please check these messages. Are those messages delivered by your colleague because you ask for help to your assignment? Are they right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages in the investigatory file.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，這些全部的簡訊都是為了完成我的作業這個目的所發送的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation about your wife accused you that you have an affair with Cai Yan Wang? What’s your plea?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '解釋' as 'explanation' instead of 'plea'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'plea' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事真的想太多了。我知道她對我顧這個家的能力沒有很滿足，我希望庭上瞭解我老婆從我讀這個學位的最開始就沒有支持我。她根本沒有意願來幫助我完成這個學位。如果她能有一點點幫助我的意願的話，我根本不用請我的同事幫我。我覺得她應該要為這些所有的誤解道歉，我希望她理解。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我希望庭上瞭解我老婆從我讀這個學位的最開始就沒有支持我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'ability of supporting the family' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'I want the court to know' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding' in the translation.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your sentences, you and your wife do not have a satisfied marriage.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們最一開始的婚姻時，我們確實有一段不錯的時光。但問題在於我的工作。 我嘗試在台灣教葡萄牙語維生但我沒辦法得到穩定的教學時數。所以我工作的問題變成我與我老婆之間的問題。我們時常針對這個問題吵架。她不信我已經盡了我的全力，我沒棒法讓她知道我所受的挫折以及我所處的困境
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '在我們最一開始的婚姻時' should be '在我們婚姻最一開始的時候'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我們時常針對這個問題吵架' should be '我們時常因為這個問題吵架'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok. Let’s talk about your graduate degree program. When do your program begin? Is that finish? Do you finish the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject and verb agreement is incorrect in the question.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the question about whether the degree has been obtained.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在民國99年的春天開始這個課程。這是一個兩年的計畫。我應該再民國101年12月完成這個計畫的。我沒有完成這個學位因為我需要做我的兼職工作所以我沒有時間完成一些作業。就像我所說的，我的老婆沒有很支持我在這個學位上。這讓我覺得追求那個學位完全都是靠我個人，我太累了也太受挫。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'Spring 2010' as '民國99年的春天'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'December 2012' as '民國101年12月'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'part-time' as '兼職工作'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'supportive' as '支持'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'all alone by myself' as '靠我個人'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'tired and frustrated' as '太累了也太受挫'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You meant this program is for two-year long. Why you cannot get the degree? Why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我不能完成所有課程所要求的東西。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'the' before 'course requirement'.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When is your registration over?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊在學最後的期限是民國102年的秋天。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, you finish your degree program on December 5th in 2012. After that day, you don’t need to finish your assignment. Is that right? But you have messages delivered by your colleague after the course ended for six months. What’s your reason?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the word '作業' as 'assignment' instead of 'homework'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the messages being delivered by the colleague.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我雖然沒有完成這個學位但並不代表我不想讓我的語言能力進步阿。就算我的計畫失敗了，我仍然想要增進我的中文能力所以我靠自學來達成這個目標。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You meant although you didn’t finish the program, you want to learn Chinese by yourself in order to improve your Chinese ability?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
沒錯，這就是為什麼我請我同事幫忙的原因。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague plays a role as your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她並不是我的家教而已，而且他是我真正的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不只是...而且...' (not only...but also...).

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我嘗試要付她錢但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我嘗試要付她錢但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
You didn’t pay her salary, why she still delivers some messages to you in the midnight although you didn’t pay her. Isn’t that beyond the co-worker’s responsibility for helping others?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '付錢給她' as 'pay her salary' instead of 'pay her'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'you didn't pay her' after 'although' instead of before.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'salary' in the translation.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user did not convey the appropriate level of formality in the translation.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我說他是一個很支持我的朋友了。她用她自己的時間來協助我學習中文。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' (he) was used instead of '她' (she).
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '是' (is) should agree with the subject '她' (she), so it should be '是一個' (is a) instead of '是一' (is).
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	The phrase 'supportive friend' was translated as '支持我的朋友' (supportive friend) instead of '支持性的朋友' (supportive friend).

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Do you still teach English in that cram school?'

Yes, I am still working there.
沒錯我仍然在那邊上班。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does Cia Yen Wang still work in the cram school, too?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Does Cia Yen Wang still work there?'

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她仍然在那邊上班，但我們不是搭擋了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們不再搭擋了' instead of '但我們不是搭擋了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you need to subpoena more witness or evidence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena Cia Yen Wang in Bo Yuan cram school to the court. I want to ask her to explain the relationship between she and the defendant and ask her to explain the meaning of those messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the crucial information that the speaker wants to contact the defendant's colleague as a witness.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'I want' instead of 'I hope' to express the speaker's intention.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'subpoena' instead of 'contact' to convey the speaker's intention of reaching out to the colleague.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '證人' (witness) as 'explain' instead of 'testify' or 'provide testimony'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '簡訊' (messages) as 'meaning' instead of 'content' or 'context'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, do you need any help from the court to investigate any further evidence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has some actions according to the relationship between my husband and his colleague. One of the actions is to persuade Cia Yen Wang to quit the job. Can we ask the court to prove that action?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	補習班 (cram school) should be 法院 (court)
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'the cram school' is singular, so it should be 'has' instead of 'have'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the actions taken by the cram school
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the relationship between the husband and his colleague
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the name of the colleague
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the name of the queen
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the reason for persuading Cia Yen Wang to quit
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the possibility of asking the court to prove the action

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you need the court to investigate any evidence for you? The situation is your degree finished on the December 5th in 2012. You don’t have a reason to act with your colleague Cia Yen Wang in the reason of finishing your assignment. Especially, your message activity is starting after 9pm. Your behavior is suspected by people. Do you have any evidence to help your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'You don’t have a reason to act with your colleague Cia Yen Wang in the reason of finishing your assignment.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'your degree finished on the December 5th in 2012' does not accurately convey the meaning of '你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant's hope for the court to investigate evidence for them.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation leaves out the mention of the defendant's need for evidence to help their case.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有想到有任何庭上可以採取的行動來針對我的行為。就像我所說的，我的同事和我的行為的目的是非常簡單的。我只是想要增進我的語言能力和學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So we will have the witness asking court at 4:30 pm, June 9th 2014. The plaintiff and defendant need to come to the court. If that is necessary, both of you can have lawyers.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '證人詰問程序' as 'witness asking court', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific year (103年) in the translation.

我明白。
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
我明白。

今天庭期到此結束。
Ok. Today’s court ends here.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '庭期' which means 'court session' in the translation.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
 Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery. The defendant , Yu-Hua Chen, file this case. The reason why she files this case is that her husband had an intention relationship with her colleague in the cram school. The defendant finds some intimate message in her husband cellphone message record. In addition to that, her husband have some and have tele-conference at the middle of night. The content which was found by defendant is beyond co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, she file this case. Your wife charge you of adultery. What’s your plead?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The defendant , Yu-Hua Chen, file this case.' It should be 'The defendant, Yu-Hua Chen, files this case.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'intention relationship' should be 'inappropriate relationship' or 'affair' to accurately convey the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant's husband's name, John Anderston.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the charge of adultery against the defendant's husband.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the defendant's husband's response to the charge of adultery.

Not guilty, of course.
當然是無罪答辯
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
  The procedure of today is to ask the defendant about the detail information of message. The purpose of this court is ask more information and confirm that whether it will constitute adultery. Do both sides understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the purpose of the procedure, which is to clarify whether the defendant and their colleague are having an extramarital affair.

我明白
Yes,I understand

I understand.
我明白了

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Let me ask the defendant, how long did you married and di you have child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant's husband.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant's children.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
My husband and I have married for four years. We don’t have child
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'husband and I', so it should be 'have been' instead of 'have'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'been', which is important for indicating the duration of the marriage.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'children', which is important for conveying the meaning of not having any kids.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or on abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you get married in Taiwan or abroad?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan. Four years ago he came to Taiwan and wanted to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Was his job is to teach Portuguese in Taiwan for several years ago?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
 In the beginning, he was the Portuguese teacher in Taiwan. After we get married, he continued to do that. But Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hour is not stable. Sometimes he did not any job for one month to two months. Because he tried to get stable job, he tried to teach English. But his mother tongue is not English, he decided to
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '葡萄牙文' as 'Portuguese teacher' instead of 'teaching Portuguese'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the husband wanting to improve his English by further studies.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'did not any job' instead of 'did not have any job'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the husband's decision to go for further studies to teach English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mention he want to get advanced degree?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural context of studying for an advanced degree in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
 No, he hopes to teach English in Taiwan and he tried to get degree about English teaching. He found distance learning program in California. Therefore, he does not have to come to America and finish his degree from online learning. After he finish his degree, he can get the master degree. His plan is that he can get this degree and found English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'His plan is that he can get this degree and found English in Taiwan' is incorrect. It should be 'His plan is that he can get this degree and find work as an English teacher in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the degree the person is trying to obtain is specifically related to English teaching.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the information that the distance learning program is offered by a university in California.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the person is completing the course requirements through correspondence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the person hopes to find work as an English teacher in Taiwan after obtaining the degree.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between the person he had affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleague in cram school. The cram school arranges foreigner teacher and Chinese teacher. Therefore, the Chinese teacher was the person she had affair with, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly interpreted the relationship between the two colleagues as an affair.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they have the affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
Initially, I found my husband stayed in cram school and worked for long time. I have asked him for long time that it was just English cram school and why did you work overtime. He told me that he had a partner of Chinese teacher and he had much communication with her. At first, I had no doubt on him. I found that he would pick up some phone after his works. When he picked up the phone, he would not tell in front of me and choose to talk in his study room. This action makes some doubts on him and I started to check on his phone.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Initially, I found my husband stayed in cram school and worked for long time.' The correct word order should be 'Initially, I found that my husband stayed in cram school and worked for a long time.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'English cram school' is not an accurate translation of '美語補習班' which means 'American English tutoring class'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the husband's partner is a Chinese teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the detail that the husband receives phone calls after work.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the detail that the husband goes to the study room to talk on the phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you found something wrong in his cell phone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '不尋常的' as 'wrong', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I found that he usually made the same phone call to someone. I started get the curious in his phone book. After that, I found he had the message with woman every day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'phone book' instead of 'communication records'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the communication was through text messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
 It was just message, is there something wrong in the message?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural context

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it was just normal message, that’s fine. He is the person who get married, how could he send some strange message? I have the content of their message to the court, it should be concluded in this file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '已婚的人' as 'the person who get married' instead of 'a married person'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the content of the messages to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see file one on the page thirteen. There are several content of message, please look at it. Does the message come from your cellphone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機上的內容簡訊
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I have several questions about this. Does the first message comes from the number 0958932 in the time of 2012, November 31th at 9:50p.m.? the content”我很想念你的愛” 這是怎麼一回事.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of 'I really miss you, my love' to '我很想念你的愛'

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是從我一個同事發過來的，我記得他因為我休假想念我所以才發過來的。她有點擔心我，這就是為什麼他發簡訊給我。我同事在美國接受，她覺得這樣是很正常的，這就是她這樣表達自己想法。而這封簡訊”我很想念你的愛，這只是我們表達關心的方式。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'colleague' as '同事' instead of '同僚'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'concerned or worried' as '擔心我' instead of '關心或擔心'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of 'she' in 'That’s why she sent me that message'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of '因為我休假' (because I took a vacation) not present in the original text
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of 'open-minded' as '覺得這樣是很正常的' (thinks it's normal) instead of '思想開放' (open-minded)

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You just mention that she stayed in the States so her thought is more westernized, right? Her emotional expression is more deliberate, tight? So ,“My love” does not mean so much, right?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
這樣的表達方式在親密朋友是很常見的。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the meaning she just mentioned before?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我前面說的，她只是擔心我，而且我們只是工作上的同事。我這樣請假兩天，她擔然會擔心我啊。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'naturally missed me' as '擔然會擔心我', which does not accurately convey the meaning of missing someone.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
 Do you mean that you just leave for two days and she send this message to you? Without your assistance in class, so she missed you very much? Just that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
內容就是這樣，沒什麼大不了的阿
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'The message' from the translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent from the same number in 2013, January 13th at 11:55 p.m. 簡訊內容”希望在身邊何時能達成” Can you tell me the mean and why she send this message to you
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這封簡訊是想問我說如何表達這樣情感在他的作業裡面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the Chinese sentence in the assignment.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You just mentioned sthat she sent this message for you just to help you with your assignment and when did she send that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛所說的，我現在在遠距教學課程之中。在這個課程之中，我必須得修滿30學分才能拿到學位。那當然我得完成一些指定的作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you just explain what did you study in your degree?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位主要是有關英語教學。在這學位的課程之中，有些是關於英語教學，也有一部分文化有關，但是有些和語言能力有相關。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '學位' which means 'degree' instead of '課程' which means 'courses'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'related to culture and language competence' is translated as '一部分文化有關，但是有些和語言能力有相關' which means 'partly related to culture, but some are related to language ability' instead of '有關文化和語言能力' which means 'related to culture and language competence'.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
You mean that your degree is about TESOL but there are some courses about culture communication, is that correct?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'mean' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
式的，我記得課程裡有三門課和文化溝通有關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
In this kind of course, what kind of assignment did the professor give to you?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
在這門課程中，每個學生拿到的作業都因人而異，就以我來說，我是一個在台灣尋求英語教學的人，為了證明我有能力達成這樣的事情，我必須得證明我有很好的中文能力，所以在我的作業裡，有很多描述中英之間翻譯的不同
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '在這門課程中，每個學生拿到的作業因人而異'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. The verb '拿到' should agree with the plural subject '每個學生'. It should be '每個學生拿到'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	There is a tense error in the sentence. The verb '拿到' should be in the past tense to match the context of receiving assignments. It should be '拿到了'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'can be different for every student'. It should be translated as '因人而異' instead of '不同'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail of 'the culture and communication courses'. It should be translated as '這門課程'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail of 'sentence translation'. It should be translated as '中英之間翻譯'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail of 'many of my assignments'. It should be translated as '我的作業裡有很多'.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds unnecessary information by including '在台灣尋求英語教學的人'. It is not mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds unnecessary information by including '為了證明我有能力達成這樣的事情'. It is not mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds unnecessary information by including '我必須得證明我有很好的中文能力'. It is not mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds unnecessary information by including '所以在我的作業裡'. It is not mentioned in the original text.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that your plan is to teach English in Taiwan and you have to have good Chinese ability. You have to complete some assignment in this course. The content of assignments is to translate Chinese sentences
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments are given in the course.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對，除了這樣之外，我必須得精進我的中文口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok, let’s come back to the sentence you just mentioned. Is those content about your assignment?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the plural noun 'content'.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我還記得這個句子，當我拿這樣的中文句子，我不知道要怎樣翻成英文，你也知道，有些中文字對外國人來說很難辨認。我需要幫助，所以我找我的同事幫忙，所以我請她翻譯，把答案傳給我
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean the situation is that you type Chinese to her and she sent English sentence to you, is that correct? In other words, the message is about the answer of your assignment.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就只不過是我作業上的答案。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Please look at file one from thirteen to sixteen. Please see all content. Are all message the answer of your assignment? which get help from your colleague

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，所有簡訊就只是為了完成我作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Please explain that your wife just mentioned you have very close relationship with your colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of an extramarital affair in their translation.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太實在想太多了，我知道她對於我無法支撐家庭，養家活口很不滿意。我想讓法院知道，當我在修這門課的時候，她沒有給我太大的幫助。她並不想幫助我完成這個學位，如果她願意幫忙我，我就不要請教我的同事了，她才是為這些誤解負責
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'blamed' as '負責', which means 'responsible' instead of '指責', which means 'blamed'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form '負責' instead of '應該被指責', which means 'should be blamed'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'from the very beginning of my study' in the translation.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your saying, there is some unsatisfactory between you and your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚的時候，我們過得很愉快，但問題在於我有沒有工作，我想在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是工作一直很不穩定，所以工作就成了我們兩個之間的問題，為了工作這件事，我們已經吵了很多次了，她不相信我已經盡力了，她都不了解我遇到的挫折和很大困境
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我想在台灣教葡萄牙文' should be '我想在台灣教葡萄牙文'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
OK, let’s come back to the degree we just mentioned. Can you tell me that when did you start and did you finish and get the degree?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific mention of the master's degree program.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這課程在2010年春季開始的，他是一個兩年期的課程，我應該在2012年12月會完成這個學位。但我沒有完成是因為我中途有許多工作，所以沒有把時數補滿，就像我之前講的，我太太沒有支持我這樣做。所以覺得只有我一個人在為這個學位而奮鬥，所以我感到疲倦而且挫折
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我太太沒有支持我這樣做' should be '我這樣做沒有得到太太的支持'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that this degree is a two-year program and you did not finish it. Could you explain that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有完成所有必修課程
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'requirement' which is an important detail in the original text.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
The last semester you register in this course, when did you end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後註冊的學期是2012秋季
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If everything was going through like you said, the last semester would end in 2012, December 5th and you wouldn’t have any assignment after that. But you still have message for six months after the course ended.
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect verb tense used

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
 雖然我沒有完成我的學位，但不代表我不能增進我的語言能力阿，雖然我沒辦法完成學位，但我還是想增進我的中文能力，所以決定自己研讀
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有完成我的學位' instead of '我沒有完成我的學位'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about studying on their own. The correct translation should include '自己研讀' to convey the meaning of studying on their own.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean even though you failed to finish this degree, you still want to learn Chinese and improve yourself.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
那也就是為什麼我持續問我同事問題
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of asking for help, the translation states that the user continues to ask their colleague questions.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, your colleague play role with tutor in your learning.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他扮演不僅是家教而且要是很要好的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不僅是家教而且也是很要好的朋友'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her money?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you pay her money?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我想付錢但她不要了
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'she declined', the user's translation says '她不要了', which means 'she doesn't want it' or 'she doesn't want it anymore'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you did pay her money, why did she answer you at midnight which she was supposed to? This relationship is not normal between colleagues.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation does not convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness in the context of colleagues.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
 就像之前說得，她是一個非常好的人。他願意花她的時間來幫我增進中文
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'was' should agree with the subject 'she', but it is translated as '他' which means 'he'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'supportive' is translated as '好的人' which means 'good person', but it should be translated as '支持性的' which means 'supportive'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The phrase 'to help me learn Chinese' is omitted in the translation.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach in the cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific mention of the subject being taught, which is 'English'.

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我仍在那邊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Did your co-worker, Tsai-Yen Wang work in this cram school?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '王彩燕' as 'Tsai-Yen Wang' instead of 'Caiyan Wang'.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她仍在那邊工作，但我們沒有再一起教書了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們沒有再一起工作了' instead of '但我們沒有再一起教書了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there more evidence you want the court to investigate or subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena his colleague , Tsai-Yen Wang, in Po-Yuan cram school which was the witness in this case. Please ask her why did she send those message and the content of messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about explaining the relationship between the witness and the defendant.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect subject-verb agreement in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had taken some actions to their relationship. I heard that the cram school had persuaded his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang, to leave the job. Is it possible that I want the cram school to confirm this.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女王彩燕' as 'his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the actions taken by the cram school
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user added the request to confirm the information, which is not present in the original text

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you want ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you? The situation is that your case had finished in 2012. There is no reason that you can explain message for your assignment. Especially, your message comes from after 9 p.m. and those casue some doubts for people. Is there any evidence which may help you with your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Defendant, do you want ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you?' It should be 'Defendant, do you want to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束' as 'your case had finished in 2012'. The correct translation should be 'your master's degree had already ended on December 5th, 2012 in the Republic of China'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'There is no reason that you can explain message for your assignment.' It should be 'There is no reason that you can explain the message for your assignment.'

grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Is there any evidence which may help you with your case?' It should be 'Is there any evidence that may help you with your case?'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我覺得庭上好像沒辦法查到任何幫助我案情的證據。就像我剛才說的，我們之間傳簡訊的目的是非常單純的。這樣做只是為了完成語言能力和完成我的作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我覺得庭上好像沒辦法查到任何幫助我案情的證據。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是為了完成語言能力和完成我的作業' as 'I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.' The correct translation should be '這樣做只是為了完成我的作業' which means 'I did it just to complete my assignment.'

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court will be set at 4:30, 2013, June 9th, for the procedure of witness. Both sides have to come to this court on time. If necessary, both sides could have lawyer, understand?

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
 Today is the preparation procedure for adultery case. The plaintiff, Chen Yu Hua, filed this case. The main reason the plaintiff file this case is that her husband has intimate relationships with his colleagues. The plaintiff found out some intimate message in her husband’s cellphone. In addition, her husband would find some reasons for working late and he would tele-conference with his colleague, Wang Chai Yu. The contents between her husband and his colleague collected by the plaintiff was too intimate, and it’s beyond the normal colleague relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. Defendant, your wife doubt you that you have adultery with other women. What’s your plea?

 Today is the preparation procedure. And the main goal is to clarify the contents between the defendant and his colleague. We would like to know this case in detail and to know if it constitutes adultery. Do both of the parties understand the procedure?

我明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you two been married and do you have any children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve been married for four years and we don’t have any kids.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Do you two get married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you two get married in Taiwan or abroad?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan. He came to Taiwan four years ago. And at that time, he came to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is the one who wants to learn Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the sentence 'We met in Taiwan.'

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Has he taught Portuguese in the last (few) years?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Has he taught Portuguese in the last (few) years?'

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not really popular in Taiwan, so my husband’s working situation is not really stable. Further, sometimes he would have a period between jobs (which) lasts for month. Then, he wants to have a stable income. He started to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he wants to pursue advanced study
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the phrase 'a period between jobs (which) lasts for month'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'a' before 'month' in the phrase 'a period between jobs (which) lasts for month'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'to' before 'pursue' in the phrase 'he wants to pursue advanced study'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just said that that he wants to pursue advanced study, so does he want to get another degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'pursue advanced study' instead of 'get another degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he needs to get a degree for English teaching. He found a distance program online from California. Consequently he doesn’t have to go to the United States. He can complete the program at home. After he finish(es) all the courses, he can get the degree. If he receives the degree from California, the US, then he would find a job of English teaching in Taiwan
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form ('finish' should be 'finishes')
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'all' before 'the courses'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'he' before 'receives the degree'

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s his relationship with his colleague
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '外遇對象' as 'colleague' instead of 'affair partner'.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in the cram school. At that cram school, they assign a foreign teacher to match with another local teacher and that person is his partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they two have intimate relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'intimate relationship' instead of 'affair'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I just noticed that my husband usually worked really late at cram school. I’ve asked him for many times. “It’s only a small cram school. Why would you need to work so late?” he told me that because we need to teach with another teacher at the same time, so we need to cooperate and need to discuss something. I didn’t doubt him at first. Later, he would receive some calls even when he arrived home. Further, he would answer the call not in front of me and he would go(es) back to his room to answer the call. This aroused my curiosity, so I checked his cellphone
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband's late work at the cram school made the wife suspicious.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'goes' instead of 'go' in the sentence 'he would go(es) back to his room to answer the call.'
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of the wife checking her husband's cellphone as a result of her suspicion.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Do you see any abnormal message in his cellphone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '不尋常的' as 'abnormal' instead of 'unusual'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'see' before the subject 'you' instead of the correct word order 'you see'.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I saw the same number calls him or he calls that number in his cellphone. So I checked his text messages. After that, I found out that, he sent messages with a woman almost every day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was curious and checked the text messages.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '查' as 'checked' instead of 'looked up'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the object 'his text messages' before the verb 'checked', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the communication was through text messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the communication was frequent ('almost every day').
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通簡訊' as 'sent messages' instead of 'exchanged messages'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
I think frequently texting with another person is quite normal. Is the message content abnormal ?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
 If the content is normal, I would not doubt him. However, he’s already married, how could he make others send him some intimate messages? I provided the contents of the text messages. I think all of them is (are) in the documents.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了' as 'If the content is normal'. However, the correct translation is 'If it was just normal text messages'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the plural form 'are' instead of the singular form 'is' in 'I think all of them is (are) in the documents.'

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see the Document One, page13. Defendant, here are some pieces of your text massages. Please check it. Are they the same (as) the ones in your cellphone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，它們和我手機裡的一樣。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then I would like to ask you some questions according to these messages. The first one is sent from the number 0958932*** at nine fifty p.m. on November 31st 2012. The content is I really miss you…(what do you mean by this sentence?)
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I really miss you' as 'I really miss you...' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
我記得我那時候休假了兩天。她有點擔心我。所以她才會發這則簡訊。我的同事是在美國受教育的所以她待人比較隨和， 所以她講話比較直接就像簡訊上那樣。「親愛的」只是我們稱呼自己在乎的人的方法。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the colleague being open-minded.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The translation does not convey the cultural meaning of calling someone 'my love'.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that the person who sent you this message was educated in America, so she’s quite open-minded and westernized? Then she’s quite open to express her emotions and affections. Therefore, “my love” means nothing. Do you mean that?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿，這就只是認識很久朋友互相的稱呼或是互相關心的人會這樣稱呼。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about another sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我說過了，她很擔心我。但我們就只是同事的關係。當我有兩天沒去上班的時候，她當然會想到我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們只是同事的關係' instead of '就只是同事的關係我們'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Did you mean that she sent you this message just because you were two day off from work? Without your assistance and cooperation, so she missed you? Is that this simple?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對阿就只是這樣而已，並沒有甚麼大不了的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'no big deal', the user's translation says 'nothing serious'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Then, please check the second message. It’s from the same number at 11:55 p.m. on January 13th 2013. The content is something intimate, what does that mean? What does that mean by these lines?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the intimate meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這樣的訊息給我只是想要教我中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you this kind of messages to help you with your Chinese assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太先前說的，我正在唸一個學位。要完成學位我要在畢業前修完30個學分，那當然我需要做一些作業來拿到學分阿。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '修完' (complete) should come before the object '30個學分' (30 credits).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'Master's program' and 'assignments and exercises', which are important details in the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain further for your master degree? What do you study for?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位是有關英語教學的。要完成這個學位，裡面有些關於教學的課程也有些關於中英語文能力的訓練。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'TESOL' as '英語教學' which means 'English teaching' instead of '英語教學與第二語言習得' which means 'Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' ('is') after the noun '學位' ('degree') instead of before it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that some of the courses were related to culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you pursue for the English teaching mater degree; however there are still some further culture courses in that degree?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'you' in the sentence, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'pursue' instead of 'pursuing'.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the word 'still' which is not present in the original text.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misunderstood the meaning of 'further culture courses' and translated it as 'some further culture courses'.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，至少有三門課是跟文化和溝通相關的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
You used the tem culture, so what would the teacher give you as assignments in the course?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'give' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'used' before the subject 'You' instead of after.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這門課的功課可能會因學生而異。像我自己的話，我來台灣然後想要找一個英語教學的教師職位，為了要達成這個目標然後顯現這個能力，所以我必須要有足夠的中文能力。因此我很多作業都是關於中英句子的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '像我自己的話，我來台灣然後想要找一個英語教學的教師職位'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments are for culture and communication courses.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'culture and communication courses' as '這門課' which means 'this course' instead of '文化與溝通課程' which means 'culture and communication courses'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments can be different for every student.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments are about Chinese-English sentence translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'sentence translation' as '句子的翻譯' which means 'translation of sentences' instead of '中英句子的翻譯' which means 'Chinese-English sentence translation'.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that your goal is to teach English in Taiwan, so the course would ask you to proof your Chinese competence? Therefore, you had to complete some assignments and these assignments are about English and Chinese translation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
當然阿，而且我還需要磨練我的口說和寫作技巧
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, so you said that this message content was your assignment right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿，我還記得那個句子是甚麼。當我看到一個中文句子的時候我可能會不知道如何用英文來表達。你也知道吧，中文字有些時候對於外國人來說很難辨認阿，所以我需要別人的幫助，所以我就問我同事，我請她幫我翻譯然後請她把答案以簡訊寫給我。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	Neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Incorrect use of pronouns
grammar and structure	preposition errors	Incorrect use of prepositions

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that you ask your colleague this sentence in Chinese and she sent it back in English? Is this the situation? You mean that this message was just all about assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那則簡訊真的就只是作業答案而已啦。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then, how about the contents in Document One from page 14 to 16? Please check these messages. Are they all for your assignments? Just because you want your colleague to answer you in English?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，它們的目的都相同，就只是要幫我完成作業而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then how about the adultery between you and 王彩燕 from you wife?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'adultery' is not an accurate translation for '外遇'.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
對於這件事我太太真的是想太多了。我知道她對於我可以照顧家庭的能力不滿意。我想讓您知道的是，從我開始念學位開始，她都很不支持，她甚至一點都不想要幫助我完成學位。如果她多幫我一點忙的話，我也不用問我同事啦，我想她應該要為這樣的誤解負責。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '對於這件事我太太真的是想太多了' should be '我太太真的是想太多了對於這件事'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error: '我知道她對於我可以照顧家庭的能力不滿意' should be '我知道她對於我照顧家庭的能力不滿意'.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, you two don’t get along quite well?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在婚姻初期我們是相處得滿愉快的。但她一直對我的工作有微詞。我也嘗試要教葡萄牙語來維生，但工作不穩定。所以我們有時候會為了這件事有口角，我們常為了這件事情不合，她都不相信我有努力找工作，我也很難讓她理解我有多沮喪和挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們常為了這件事情不合' is incorrect. It should be '我們常為了這件事情不合而爭吵'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '她一直對我的工作有微詞'. It should be '她一直對我的工作有微詞'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '教葡萄牙語來維生' is translated as 'teaching Portuguese to make a living', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'teaching Portuguese in Taiwan'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'fought from time to time over this issue' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced' in the original text.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s go back to the mater degree you mentioned. When did you start your master degree? When did you end it? Did you receive the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you start your master's degree?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you end it?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'receive' should agree with the subject 'you'. It should be 'Did you receive the degree?'

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2010的春季開始上課。它是一個兩年的課程，我應該要在2012的12月完成這個學業，但是我並沒如期完成，因為我有一些兼職，還要寫作業，這樣有點困難。就想我先前說的，我太太不太支持我，所以我會覺得我自己在念書的時候好像只有一個人在奮鬥，所以我相當疲憊跟挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我是在2010的春季開始上課'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '我應該要在2012的12月完成這個學業'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the user's translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the mention of working part-time and not having enough time for course assignments.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the mention of feeling alone and unsupported in pursuing the degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the mention of feeling tired and frustrated.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the mention of the user's wife not being supportive.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	Addition of the phrase '所以我會覺得我自己在念書的時候好像只有一個人在奮鬥' which is not present in the original text.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that it’s two-year-long program and you didn’t finish it, why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '兩年期的' as 'two-year-long' instead of 'two-year program'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'didn't finish' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我無法達成每堂課的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When was(did) the last semester you registered end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋季班。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '2012年的秋季班'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If what you said I is true, and the last semester of your registration ended on December 5th 2012; then after that you would not have to contact your colleague for the assignment right? However, you two, you and your colleague, had been contacting with each other for over six months after that.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '課程結束' as 'registration ended' instead of 'course ended'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '你就不會有任何作業了吧?' which means 'you would not have any assignments, right?'

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我可能真的無法完成學業，但並不代表我不想學習阿。雖然我無法完成學業，但我想持續精進中文，所以才會繼續和她聯絡。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我可能真的無法完成學業，但並不代表我不想學習。'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. The verb '聯絡' should agree with the subject '我', so it should be '我才會繼續和她聯絡。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about studying 'on my own' in the translation.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even that you didn’t complete your degree, you still want to sharpen your Chinese by your own?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
是的，這就是我繼續和我同事尋求協助的原因。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
Your colleague is just like your tutor right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是家教的角色她還是我真心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經有提過，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經有提過，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why would she like to teach you Chinese so late at night, even it’s time for bed? Is it beyond the normal relationships between colleagues?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
我說過啦，她是一個很好的朋友，很支持我。她用她自己私人的時間來教我中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是一個很好的朋友，很支持我。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of learning Chinese in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach at that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那裏工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does 王彩燕 also work there till now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那裏工作，但我們沒有再搭檔合作了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們沒有再搭檔合作了，她也還在那裏工作。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Is there any person you want to subpoena or is there any evidence you want to investigate more?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena 王彩燕 as a witness from 伯元cram school. I want her to describe their relationships and why she wrote that kind of messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of subpoenaing 王彩燕 as a witness.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'I want her' instead of 'I would like to subpoena her'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'is' instead of 'are' in the question.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that cram school has taken some actions for their relationships. Further, the cram school had tried to make 王彩燕 off. I don’t know if there is any possibility to proof this.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'make' should be 'convince' in this context.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'stay' after 'make' in the sentence.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? Now the situation is that your program should end on December 5th 2012, and you should not use completing assignments as an excuse to contact 王彩燕. The text messages between you two almost happened after 9 p.m. It’s really easily to rouse people’s curiosity. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master's degree program ending on December 5th, 2012.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'your program should end' instead of 'your program ended'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '以做作業為藉口' as 'use completing assignments as an excuse' instead of 'use doing assignments as an excuse'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the text messages being between the defendant and 王彩燕.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'almost' before 'happened' instead of after it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the text messages happening mostly after 9 p.m.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '起人疑竇' as 'rouse people's curiosity' instead of 'arouse people's suspicion'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant needing evidence to help his case.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我實在想不到有甚麼其他的證據了，誠如我之前所說的，我和我同事之間的簡訊互動真的很普通，我真的只是想要增進中文能力然後繼續學中文。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'communication between my colleague and me' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '誠如我之前所說的' (as I said before) in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '簡訊互動' (text message interaction) instead of 'communication' in their translation.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
Then we set next court at 4:30 p.m. on June 9th 2014 for the witness procedure. Please both of you show up at that time. If it’s necessary, you two have the right to lawyer.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '中華民國103年06月09日' as 'June 9th 2014' instead of 'June 9th, 2014'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '證人詰問程序' (witness procedure) in the translation.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re here for the preparation of adultery case.The plaintiff, Ms. Chen, sued the case.The main reason is that her husband is too intimate with his colleague at the cram school.The plaintiff found some messages from his colleague.besides, her husband always makes up reasons for staying late and even have conferencing with Wang zhia yen at night.The plaintiff thinks that the contents of her husband with his colleague Ms. Wang has over beyond colleagues relationship. As a result, she sued the case. Defendant, you wife sued you adultery. What’s your explanation?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong translation of '告訴人' as 'plaintiff' instead of 'complainant'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	wrong translation of '告訴' as 'sued' instead of 'accused'

Not guilty, of course.
我無罪

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparation procedure, we would like to clarify the details of the defendant and Ms.Wang. We are to find whether their relationship can constitute adultery. Do both parties understand?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
how long have you been married? You have kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married?' instead of 'How long have you been married?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you'. It should be 'have you' instead of 'have you'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the question about having kids.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
we have been married for four years. We don’t have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you two marry in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan and he wanted to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'We met each other in Taiwan.' instead of 'We each other met in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker and their husband met in Taiwan. This is an important detail that should be included in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation also omits the information that the husband came to Taiwan 4 years ago. This is another important detail that should be included in the translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses 'teach' instead of 'learn'. The original text states that the husband came to Taiwan to learn Portuguese, not to teach it.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
in the past few years, he worked at Taiwan as a Portuguese teacher?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'he worked as a Portuguese teacher in Taiwan in the past few years.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation incorrectly states that he worked 'at' Taiwan instead of 'in' Taiwan.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language to learn, his teaching hours was unstable.sometimes he did not have to work for a month.Later he wanted to teach English, in order to have stable teaching hours.But his mother tongue is not English, so he decides to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'After we got married, he kept teaching Portuguese' is incorrect. It should be 'He kept teaching Portuguese after we got married.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb 'was' in the sentence 'When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher' should be 'is' to maintain consistency with the present tense used in the rest of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the teaching hours were unstable and sometimes there were months without any classes.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds the unnecessary information that Portuguese is not a popular language to learn in Taiwan.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation leaves out the context that the husband wanted to teach English in order to have stable teaching hours.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he seek an advanced degree, you mean he want to get a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advanced degree' instead of 'take further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get the degree of English- teaching.He found a online learning program from California in the USA on the internet.He can learn English on the internet without going to the USA.After he finishes the program, he can get a master degree.His original plan is that after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan as a professor.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '取得的學位是關於英語教學的' as 'the degree of English-teaching' instead of 'the degree related to English teaching'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'He wanted to teach English in Taiwan' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'No.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the online learning program is a distance education course.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the degree is a master's degree.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the plan is to teach English in Taiwan as a professor.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between he and the person he has affair with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇對象' as 'the person he has affair with' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues at the cram school.The cram school has an arrangement of a foreigner with a Chinese teacher. She’s his partner as a Chinese teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'She is his partner as a Chinese teacher.'

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How come do you find out they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'how come do you find out', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'how do you know'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
First, I noticed that my husband always stayed late at the cram school and worked.I asked him several times, it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so many extra work?He told me that because he has to discuss many details with his partner.At first, I did not suspect him.But later I found that he always gets some calls after he came back.And, when he gets the calls, he talks in the study room. He never talks on the phone in front of me.So I checked his phone and I started to suspect him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so many extra work?' It should be 'it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so much extra work?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'he has to discuss many details with his partner' is translated as 'he has to discuss many details with his partner'. The correct translation should be 'he has to communicate with his partner'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the husband receives calls after coming back home.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the husband talks on the phone in the study room.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the wife checked her husband's phone.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds the unnecessary detail that the wife started to suspect her husband.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is always the same number.I was very curious and I checked his text message.After I checked, I found that she text the message with the woman every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼' as 'In his phone book, there is always the same number', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '常常看到同一個電話號碼'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the user being curious and checking the text messages, which is important for understanding the context.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the user finding out that the person in question is texting with a woman almost every day.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
It’s just text messages, I think it’s okay, is there any weird content inside?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If these are just usual messages, that’s okay. But he’s a married man, how can he let the other people to send him those intimate messages? I’ve already provided some messages to the court, they should be on the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '已婚的人' as 'married man' instead of 'a married person'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about providing the messages to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Document number 1 page number 13. Defendant, please check the content of the text messages.Are these from your cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the text messages.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對 這些都是我手機裡的簡訊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I would like to ask you some questions about these messages.The first message is sent at 9:50 pm. November, thirty-one, 2012.from the number 0958932.The content is: I really miss you, my love, what’s the meaning of this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事傳的，我記得那時我請了兩天假，她有點擔心,所以她寄了那封簡訊給我她是在美國讀書的，所以思想很開放那就是她表答自己的方法，她平常都這樣講話，至於my love那個地方只是要表答我們在乎的人
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean the sender was educated in the USA, so she’s more opened?She’s more open-minded about expressing herself, so there’s nothing with the two words, my love?
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not accurately translate the idiomatic expression '我的愛' as 'my love'.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
那就是只是彼此是好朋友會這樣說而已，沒什麼啊
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
What about the last sentence she mentioned?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the last sentence mentioned by the speaker.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛說的，因為我請假所以她有點擔心，畢竟我們是搭檔, 她當然會擔心
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為我請假所以她有點擔心'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'missed me'. Instead of using '畢竟我們是搭檔', the correct translation should be '她自然地想念我'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that she sent those two messages because you took two days off?Because without your assistance, she missed you, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對呀 就是這樣，沒什麼大不了
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, then the second message which is sent at 11:55 at night, January thirteenth 2013, sent by the same person.The content is, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” Can you tell me what does it mean? Why she sends such a message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這句話來告訴我要怎麼寫我一個中文的作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you such a message is to help you with your homework? IWhat does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛告訴法官的，我之前想修碩士學位在課程中，我需要得到30個學分才能得到那個學位，當然我就會有一些作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '修' (to study) should come before the noun '碩士學位' (master's degree).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about completing assignments and exercises, which is an important detail mentioned in the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain the details about your master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我是在修英語課，在那些課程中有些是關於英語教學，有些則是關於文化與語言能力方面的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you want to get the TESOL and there’s some cultural related program, is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
我記得至少有三門課都跟語言文化有關係
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What’s the assignment in the program?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'kind' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
語言文化的作業每個人不同我的話，因為我在台灣想要學習英文來當英文老師為了要達到這個目的，我必須要證明我對英文中文有足夠的了解所以很多的作業都是中英的翻譯句子
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to understand Chinese as to be the teacher in Taiwan?As a result, you have to finish your assignment including the translation of some Chinese and English?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的就是這樣, 而且我還需要增強我的寫作技巧以及口說
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay let’s go back to the sentence we just mentioned, is that your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
有 我還記得這個句子，當我拿到這個句子並不知道它的英文要怎麼講 你也知道有時候中文字對外國人來說真的很難，我需要別人幫忙所以我就請我的同事幫我我請她幫我翻譯那個句子然後再寄簡訊給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of asking the colleague to help with the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation leaves out the mention of receiving the answer via text message.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that you asked your colleague to send you the answer with the text messages?Is that right?The content of the text message is just the answer of your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那些內容就只是我作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then let’s check the page number 14 to 16, the text messages content in the document, please check the content, are these text messages sent from the other party was because you have to deal with your homework?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking help from the other party in the translation.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation of your wife accused you of having adultery with you colleague?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the accusation of adultery.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事真的是想太多了，我知道她不滿意我在經濟能力可能無法養這個家我希望法官知道的是，在我剛開始要求學位的時候，她都沒有給我任何一點支持她根本不願意幫忙我完成我的學業, 如果她能稍微給我點支持，那我也不用找我的同事幫忙啊，我覺得會有這些誤會,都是因為他一開始不支持
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我覺得會有這些誤會,都是因為他一開始不支持' should be '我覺得這些誤會都是因為他一開始不支持'.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your explanation, it seems that there’s some trouble between you and your wife

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
結婚剛開始我們的確很開心，不過問題在我的工作，我想臺灣教葡萄牙語, 可是沒有辦法得到穩定的授課時數結果工作變成我們兩個吵架的原因，我們總是因為這件事情吵架，她不相信我已經在這方面盡力了，沒有辦法讓她了解我其實真的非常挫敗
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我想臺灣教葡萄牙語' should be '我想在臺灣教葡萄牙語' to indicate teaching Portuguese in Taiwan.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '穩定的授課時數' is translated as 'stable teaching hours' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'stable teaching hours' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user's frustration and difficult situation faced, which is an important detail in the original text.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s get back to the master degree you just mentioned. When did you master degree begin, does it end? Did you get your degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Missing subject-verb agreement in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the verb 'begin' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the verb 'end' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the verb 'get' in the sentence.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的, 這是一個兩年的課程, 我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的但因為我兼職的關係所以我沒有辦法在時間內修完學分像我剛剛說的，我的老婆並沒有很支持我，我覺得好像只有我自己一個人努力在追求那個學位, 我覺得很累而且很受挫
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的' should be '我是在2010年的春天開始的'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence: '我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的' should be '我原本應該在2012年12月完成我的學業'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program: '因為我兼職的關係所以我沒有辦法在時間內修完學分' is missing in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated: '我覺得好像只有我自己一個人努力在追求那個學位, 我覺得很累而且很受挫' is missing in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the mention of the wife not being supportive: '像我剛剛說的，我的老婆並沒有很支持我' is missing in the translation.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that the program is for 2 years and you didn’t finish at the end, what’s the reason?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒修完全部的必修
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'course requirement' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
Then when did your last semester you’ve registered end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是在2010的秋天
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'fall 2012' as '2010的秋天', which means 'fall 2010' instead of 'fall 2012'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If that’s true, just as you’ve mentioned, then your last semester should be ended on fifth December in 2012There should be no more assignment, right? But the messages you text with your colleague last for 6 months after your program has ended, what’s the reason?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成我的學業但不代表我不想要增進我的語言能力啊！即使我沒有成功地拿到那個學位，但我還是想要增進我的中文能力所以我還是繼續努力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有完成我的學業，但不代表我不想要增進我的語言能力啊！'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb '拿到' should be past tense to match the English 'failed'. It should be '我沒有成功地拿到'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of studying 'on my own'. The correct translation should include '所以我還是繼續努力'.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對, 這就是我還找我同事幫忙的原因
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in their translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, your colleague served as your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的中文家教, 她也是一個真心好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她不收
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she still send you the text messages on midnight, when she has to go to sleep? Is this beyond one’s colleague should do?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個非常支持朋友的人，她用了自己的時間來幫助我學習中文

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'teach' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I am still working there.
對 我還有在那邊工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is your colleague, zhia-yen, Wang, still works there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那邊工作, 但我們已經不是搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經不是搭檔了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any detail or any other information or people you want to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena Ms.Wang who worked in the cram school. I would like her to explain her relation with the defendant and explain the content and the reason that she texted those messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's colleague's name, Ms. Wang, and the fact that she worked in the cram school.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'who worked in the cram school' after the name 'Ms. Wang' instead of before.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '希望能夠傳訊' as 'I would like to subpoena' instead of 'I hope to summon'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '證人身分' as 'explain her relation' instead of 'testify as a witness'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '簡訊的撰寫背景及目的' as 'the content and the reason that she texted those messages' instead of 'the background and purpose of the text messages'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had do something to deal with their relationships. They asked Ms. Wang to leave that cram school, I would like to know if it’s possible to clarify this fact?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?The situation is that your master degree, the program has ended on fifth December, 2012. There’s no excuse to say that you and Ms. Wang text message to deal with your assignment.Especially, you always send messages to each other after 9 o’clock at night, and that is very suspicious. Is there evidence can help you with your case？
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'There’s no excuse to say that you and Ms. Wang text message to deal with your assignment.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Inconsistent use of tenses in the sentence 'The situation is that your master degree, the program has ended on fifth December, 2012.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'have' in the sentence 'There’s no excuse to say that you and Ms. Wang text message to deal with your assignment.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'any' in the sentence 'Is there evidence can help you with your case?'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有辦法想到任何其他的證據法院可以幫我調查就像我剛才說的，我們兩個通簡訊的原因就是這麼簡單而已，我只是想要進步我的語言能力然後繼續學中文而已
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'evidence' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re going to proceed the preparatory procedure of adultery case. The plaintiff, yu-hua, Chen, sued the case. The main reason is that… his…her husband is so intimate with his colleague at the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages from his colleague. In addition, her husband always makes up reasons for staying late and even have conferencing with Wang zhia…yen… at night. The plaintiff thinks that the contents of her husband with his colleague Wang zhia yen has over…beyond co-worker relationship. As a result, she sued the case. Defendant, you wife sued you…adultery, what’s your plead?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'The plaintiff, yu-hua, Chen, sued the case.' It should be 'The plaintiff, Yu-hua Chen, sued the case.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'The plaintiff, yu-hua, Chen, sued the case.' It should be 'The plaintiff, Yu-hua Chen, sues the case.'

grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Defendant, you wife sued you…adultery, what’s your plead?' It should be 'Defendant, your wife sued you for adultery, what’s your plea?'

Not guilty, of course.
我當然沒有罪啊!
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, we mainly want to clarify the details of the defendant and zhia yen Wang. We aim at……to find whether their relationship can constitute adultery. Do both parties understand… know the process?
semantic conversion	omission of details	omitted the purpose of clarifying whether there is an extramarital affair

我明白
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
我也明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you married with your husband? Do you have any child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should be changed to 'been married' to match the present perfect tense.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun 'you' should be changed to 'you and your husband' to clarify the subject of the question.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for 4 years and we don’t have a child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'have been married' instead of 'have married'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
And did you two marry in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan, and he wanted to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
During the past years, was his job teaching Portuguese…in Taiwan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he’s a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still teach Portuguese. However, since there were no many people … not many people want to learn Portuguese, his teaching hours was unstable. Even for one or two months, there’s a period between jobs. After……. After that, he changed to teach English, in order to have a better job. But his mother tongue is not English, so he decides to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Since there were no many people' should be 'Since there were not many people'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'not many people want to learn Portuguese' should be 'not many people wants to learn Portuguese'.

omission or addition	leaving out critical context	Leaving out the context of 'his mother tongue is not English' in the translation.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he seek an advanced degree, did he want to get a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advanced degree' instead of 'take further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get the degree of English- teaching. He found a distance learning program from California in the USA on the internet. He can have the online learning without going to the USA … and learn English. After he gets all the credits, he can get a master degree. His original plan is that after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan as a professor.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '取得的學位是關於英語教學的' as 'the degree of English-teaching', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '取得的學位是關於英語教學的' which means 'the degree related to English teaching'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the protagonist wants to become an English teacher in Taiwan after obtaining the degree.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between he and the person he has affair with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇對象' as 'the person he has affair with' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues at the cram school. The cram school has arranged.. arranged a foreigner and a Chinese teacher together, and she’s the one who he partnered with.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How come do you think they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
First, I noticed that my husband always stayed late at the cram school and worked. I asked him several times, it’s only a/ it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so many extra work? He told me that because he has to partner with the Chinese teacher… they have to discuss many details. At first, I did not suspect him. But later on I found that he always gets some calls after he came back. And, when he gets the calls... picks up the phone, he always talks in the study room. He never talks on the phone in front of me. As a result, …I suspect,
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'I checked his phone'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form 'suspect' instead of 'suspected'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '只不過是個美語補習班' as 'it’s only a/ it’s just a cram school'

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'And, when he gets the calls... picks up the phone'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'I started to suspect him'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is always a… the same number, I’m very curious and then I checked his text message. After I checked, I found that she text the message with the woman every day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '看到' as 'checked' instead of 'saw'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is a male ('他的')
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'the same number' after 'In his phone book' instead of before
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is a male ('他的')
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '幾乎每天都通簡訊' as 'text the message with the woman every day' instead of 'almost text messages with the woman every day'

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
It’s just text messages, I think it’s okay, is there any unproper content inside?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text and misinterprets the cultural context.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If these are just usual messages, that’s okay. But he has… he’s a married man, how can he let the other party to text him with so many… text messages. I’ve already presented some text messages to the court, I think it is in the file… it should be on the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Document number… page number 13. Defendant, please check the content of the text messages. Are these from your cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the text messages.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是 這些都是我手機裡的簡訊
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
So I will ask you some questions about these messages. The first message is … was sent from…at 9:50 pm. November, 31th, 2012, from phone number 0958932…. The content is, I really miss you, my love, what’s the meaning of this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事傳的, 我記得那天我請了兩天假, 她有點擔心, 所以她才寄了那封簡訊給我, 我同事是在美國讀書的, 所以她的思想很開放, 那就是她表答自己的方法, 她都是這樣說話, 至於my love那個地方只是要表答我們在乎的人
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural expression

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean by … do you mean that…the sender was educated in the USA, so she’s more westernized? And she’s more open-minded about her feeling? So there’s nothing, or any meaningful/ meaning of the two words, my love?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
那就是只是彼此是好朋友會這樣說而已, 並沒有什麼
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not capture the idiomatic expression 'friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
What about… how about the last sentence she mentioned?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the last sentence mentioned in the original text.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛說的, 因為我請假, 她有點擔心, 我們就只是同事啊, 畢竟我們是搭檔, 她當然會擔心
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the person was worried about the speaker, but the user's translation implies that the speaker was worried about the person.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker was away for two days, which is mentioned in the original text.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that she sent those two messages because you took 2 days-off? Because there’s no your assistance, she missed you, is that so?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對呀 就只是這樣的內容, 就沒有什麼大不了的
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the message being 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, then the second message which is sent at 11:55 at night, January 13th, 2013, and was sent from the same person. The content is, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” Can you tell me what does it mean? Why she sends such a message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這句話來告訴我要怎麼寫我一個中文的專案
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you such a message, is that she wants to help you with your homework? Is that right? What does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛告訴法官的, 我之前在…想得到碩士學位, 在那個課程中, 我需要得到30個學分才能得到那個學位, 當然我就會有一些作業要寫
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '想得到' should come after the subject '我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about completing assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain… the details…about your master degree?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details about the master's degree.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我是在修英語教學, 在那些課程中有些是關於英語教學, 有些則是關於文化與語言能力方面的
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' instead of '計畫'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'TESOL' is translated as '英語教學' instead of '英語教學計畫'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'some of the courses' is omitted in the translation.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The phrase '在那些課程中' (in those courses) is added unnecessarily in the translation.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you want to get the TESOL … you study for the TESOL program, and there’s some cultural related program, is that so?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
我記得至少有三門課都跟語言文化有關係
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
Then what’s the assignment/ what are the assignments provided from these program?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
語言文化的作業… 因人而異, 像我的呢, 就是, 我在台灣想要學習英文並且當英文老師, 為了要達到這個目的, 我必須要證明我對英文中文有很大…足夠的了解. 所以我很多的作業都是中英的翻譯句子
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text and adds unnecessary content.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of assignments being about Chinese-English sentence translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to understand Chinese as to be the teacher in Taiwan? As a result, you have to finish your assignment and the homework includes the translation of  some Chinese and English?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的就是這樣, 而且我還需要增強我的寫作技巧以及口說技巧
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'speaking skills'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'writing skills'.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s… go back to the sentence we just mentioned, is that your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對啊 我還記得這個句子, 當我拿到這個句子並不知道它的英文要怎麼講, 你也知道有時候中文字對外國人來說真的很難, 我需要別人幫忙, 所以我就請我的同事幫我, 我請她幫我翻譯那個句子然後再寄簡訊給我
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was mentioned in the original text.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that you asked your colleague to send you the answer with the text messages? Is that the case? The content of the text message is just the answer of your assignment
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那些內容就只是我作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then let’s check the page number 14 to 16, the text messages content in the document, please check the content, are these text messages sent from the other party was because you have to deal with your homework?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking help from the other party in the translation.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對, 所有的這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation of your wife accused you of having adultery with you colleague?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'adultery' which is a stronger term than the original meaning of 'having an affair'.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事真的是想太多了, 我知道她不滿意我在經濟方面支持這個家庭的情況, 我希望法官知道的是, 在我剛開始要求學位的時候, 她都沒有給我任何一點支持, 她根本不願意幫忙我完成我的學業, 如果她能稍稍支持我一點, 那我也不用找我的同事幫忙啊, 我覺得會有這些誤會, 她才應該是要被責貴的人吧!
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我覺得會有這些誤會, 她才應該是要被責貴的人吧!'

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your explanation, it seems that there’s some trouble between you and your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在一開始, 結婚前我們的確有一段很美好的時光, 但…問題在我的工作, 我想臺灣教葡萄牙語, 卻沒有辦法得到比較多的授課時數, 結果工作變成我們兩個吵架的原因, 我們總是因為這件事情吵架, 她不相信我已經在這方面盡力了, 我沒有辦法讓她了解我其實真的非常沮喪, 而且遇到很多困難

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s get back to the master degree you’ve just mentioned. When did you master degree begin, does it end? Did you get your degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Missing subject-verb agreement in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the verb 'begin' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the verb 'end' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the verb 'get' in the sentence.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的, 這是一個兩年的課程, 我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的, 但因為我兼職的關係, 所以我沒有辦法在時間內修習所有我要的學分, 像我剛剛說的, 我的老婆並沒有很支持我, 我覺得好像只有我自己一個人孤獨的在追求那個學位, 我覺得很累而且很受挫
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence: '我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '我覺得好像只有我自己一個人孤獨的在追求那個學位'
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in the sentence: '我覺得好像只有我自己一個人孤獨的在追求那個學位'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that the program is for 2 years and you didn’t finish at the end, what’s the reason?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法修完全部的必修
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'course requirement' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
Then when did your last semester you’ve registered end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是在2010的秋天
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'fall 2012' as '2010的秋天', which means 'fall 2010' instead of 'fall 2012'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If that’s the case, just as you’ve mentioned, then your last… the last semester should be ended on 5th December in 2012, there should be no more assignment, right? But the messages you text with your colleague last for 6 months after your program has ended, what’s the reason?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我的確沒有完成我的學業, 但這也不代表我不想要增進我的語言能力啊! 即使我沒有成功地拿到那個學位, 但我還是想要增進我的中文能力, 所以我還是繼續研讀
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '即使我沒有成功地拿到那個學位，但我還是想要增進我的中文能力，所以我還是繼續研讀。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability and be fluently speaking Chinese, is that so?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對, 這就是我還找我同事幫忙的原因
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in their translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, your colleague can be said as… served as your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的中文家教, 她也是一個真的好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有, 我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她拒絕了'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she still send you the text messages on midnight, when she has to go to sleep? Is this beyond one’s colleague should do?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個非常支持朋友的人, 她用了自己的時間來幫助我學習中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我才說她是一個非常支持我的朋友'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific subject of teaching, which is 'English'.

Yes, I am still working there.
對, 我還有在那邊工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is your colleague, zhia-yen, Wang, still works there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那邊工作, 但我們已經不是搭檔了!
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經不是搭檔了!'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any detail or any other information or people you want to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena the…to subpoena zhia-yen, Wang who worked in po-yun cram school… as a witness. I would like her to explain her relation with the defendant and explain the content and the reason that she texted those messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I would like to subpoena zhia-yen, Wang who worked in po-yun cram school… as a witness.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail of who they want to subpoena. The correct translation should include the name of the person they want to subpoena.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail of the purpose of the text messages. The correct translation should include the reason for the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had do something to deal with … their relationships. One of that thing is that they … asked zhia-yen, Wang to leave that cram school, I would like to know if it’s possible to clarify this fact?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the cram school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you? The situation is that your master degree, the program has ended on 5th December, 2012. There’s no excuse to say that you and zhia-yen, Wang text message to deal with your assignment. Especially, you always, you texted messages to each other after 9 o’clock at night, and that is very suspicious. Is there evidence can help you with your case？
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Especially, you always, you texted messages to each other after 9 o’clock at night, and that is very suspicious.'

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase '有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？' in the translation.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有辦法想到任何其他的證據法院可以幫我調查的, 就像是我說的, 我們兩個通簡訊的原因就是這麼簡單而已.我只是想要進步我的語言能力然後繼續學中文而已
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So, the court will set at 4:30 p.m., 9th June, 2014, to cross question the witness, the defendant and the plaintiff should be there as well, if it’s necessary, both parties can have your lawyer with you.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case.The plaintiff, Yu Hua Chen filed this case.The reason why she filed the case is because her husband … had too imitate relationship with his colleague.The plaintiff found some very intimate massage in her husband’s cell phone.Plaintiff husband usually make up reasons for going home late … and have teleconference with his colleague彩燕王The … information that plaintiff had collected proved that her husband and his colleague has beyond co-workers’ relationship. As a result, the plaintiff filed the case.Defendant, your wife stated that you have committed adultery. In this case, what’s your plea?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	imitate instead of intimate relationship
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	teleconference instead of video call
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of the defendant's name

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯，當然
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當然，無罪答辯。'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the court is mainly to … know the details in those intimate massages.The purpose of today’s court is to find out whether the defendant does have committed adultery with defendant’s colleagueDo both parties understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	intimate massages instead of communication details
omission or addition	omitting important details	omitted the purpose of clarifying whether the defendant and their colleague are having an affair
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	does have committed adultery instead of has committed adultery
omission or addition	omitting important details	omitted the question of whether both parties understand the procedure

我明白
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
我也明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long…have you married your husband? And do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'how long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'have you married'.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The question should include the word 'been' to indicate the duration of the marriage.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years. And we don’t have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or in the foreign country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.'

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past years, his job is teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense to match the time frame mentioned in the original text.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
At first we met, he worked as a teacher who was teaching Portuguese.After he got married, he is still teaching PortugueseHowever, the Portuguese is … always not a popular language in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hours are always not very long.Sometimes … the period between jobs might be one month or two months.Later on, he hopes to have stable income. Therefore, he started to want to teach English.But English is not his mother tongue; he decided to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'At first we met, he worked as a teacher who was teaching Portuguese.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the Portuguese is … always not a popular language in Taiwan' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the husband's teaching hours are unstable and sometimes there are gaps of one or two months between courses.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation includes the unnecessary information that the husband hopes to have stable income.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Sometimes … the period between jobs might be one month or two months.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the husband decided to seek an advanced degree in order to teach English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Did you mean that he wanted to study a diploma in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'diploma' instead of 'advanced degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
NoBecause he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he needed to have a degree relating to English teaching.He found a program provided from the California online.  He didn’t have to go to America to learn the course. Instead, he can learn the course through on-line learning.If he finished all the courses required, he can have the degree.His plan is once he has the degree, he can apply for the jobs to teach English through this degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'NoBecause he wanted to teach English in Taiwan'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'it' in the sentence 'He found a program provided from the California online.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'the' in the sentence 'He didn’t have to go to America to learn the course.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'the' in the sentence 'Instead, he can learn the course through on-line learning.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'the' in the sentence 'If he finished all the courses required, he can have the degree.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'a' in the sentence 'His plan is once he has the degree, he can apply for the jobs to teach English through this degree.'

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is the relationship between him and his colleague?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school.The cram school will have a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher in the same class. And the woman is the Chinese teacher in his class.
minor categories of semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'tutoring center'.
minor categories of omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the information about the arrangement of the Chinese and foreign teachers in the same class.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know he had an affair with her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I’m only aware of that he often stayed late in the cram school.I have asked him for many times that why you have to stay late in the cram school.He told me that because he has to work with the Chinese teacher, they have many things to discuss.At first, I didn’t doubt him.However, I found that he would receive some phone calls after he came home.And when he got the phone call, he will talk to the phone in his study instead of in front of me.This behavior made me doubt him. That is the reason why I started to check his cell phone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband is a teacher in a cram school.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'have' instead of 'has' to agree with the singular subject 'he'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband receives phone calls after coming home.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband talks on the phone in the study instead of in front of the user.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
In the cell phone, did you find anything special?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is a phone number called him often.I became curious so I checked his texts.After I checked, I found that he almost texted with another woman every day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'phone book' instead of 'communication records'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the phone number appeared frequently in the communication records.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'called' before the subject 'him' instead of 'he called'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'phone book' instead of 'communication records'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user checked the texts out of curiosity.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user found out that the person was texting with another woman.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Texting messages is fine, right? Is the content inappropriate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '還好吧' as 'right' instead of 'okay'.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If that is a normal text, that is OK.However, he is married, how could he text with another woman in such an intimate tone?I have provided some messages to the court. I believe you can see them in the file.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the tone of the original text

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see the page 13 of investigatory file.Here are some messages. Defendant, please take a look.Are they the messages on your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是，這些是我手機上的簡訊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
According these messages, I want to ask you some questions.The first message was texted at nine fifty pm on thirty first, November, 2012 from 0958-932*** The content is 我真的很想你，我的愛 What does it mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I really miss you, my love' as '我真的很想你，我的愛' is accurate in terms of meaning, but the word choice for 'my love' could be improved. It is more common in Chinese to use '親愛的' (dear) instead of '我的愛' (my love) to address someone affectionately.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我一個同事發的我記得那時候我休了兩天的假 她有點擔心我這也就是為什麼他會傳這封簡訊給我我的同事是在美國受教育，所以她的思想比較開放這是她說話的方式至於她稱呼我為我的愛，那只是一種我們之間的稱呼而已
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that because the person who text you is educated in the United States, she is westernized.And the way she expressed herself is more openSo “my love” doesn’t mean anything special, right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of 'my love' and assumes it doesn't have any special meaning.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然，這只是一種表達關心的方式而已，只代表我們很關心彼此
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous statement?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the previous statement in their translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就如同我之前說的，她非常擔心我，我們是工作上的同事 當我不在工作崗位上兩天，她當然會想我啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean the person texts you because you have two days off.Because she didn’t have your help in the class, she missed you?That’s all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by suggesting that the person texts the speaker because they have two days off, rather than the original meaning of the person texting because the speaker didn't provide assistance in class.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對，當時的背景就是這樣，這封簡訊沒什麼
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the message was a text message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message sent at eleven fifty fife p.m. on thirteenth, January, 2013 from the same phone number mentioned above.The content of the message is 我希望你可以在我身邊，什麼時候我們才可以在一起呢?What does this message mean? What did she send you this kind if message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
 她寫給我這封簡訊的原因是教我在作業裡怎麼用中文講這句話
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she texted you this message to help you with your assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我之前講的，我正在進修碩士學程在這個學程，我被要求要修滿三十學分，才可以取得這個學位很自然地，我就有一些作業和練習要做啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '講' (speak) should come after the subject '我' (I).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'my wife informing the court' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of 'assignments and exercises' in the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what exactly you studied for your Master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位名稱是英語教學在這個學程裡面，主要的課程有關於英語教學，其他則關於文化還有語言能力方面的課程
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '學位名稱' which means 'degree name' instead of '學程' which means 'program'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'TESOL' is translated as '英語教學' which means 'English teaching' instead of 'TESOL' which is an acronym for 'Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '在這個學程裡面，主要的課程有關於英語教學，其他則關於文化還有語言能力方面的課程'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'some of the courses' in the original text.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you are seeking a degree about English teaching, but there are some courses about culture and language competence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'competence' in their translation.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user did not accurately convey the meaning of 'culture and language competence' in their translation.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是，我記得至少有三個課程和文化與溝通有關
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
In this kind of courses, what kind of assignments would you have?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'have' in the question.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
語言與文化課程的作業可能會因同學而異就舉我為例子我是一個希望在台灣能取得教師資格的人為了要達成這個目的，我必須要證明我在使用中文上很有能力因此，大部分我的作業是有關中英的翻譯
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Because you planned to teach English in Taiwan, the course required you to prove that you have the competence in dominating Chinese.So you have to complete the assignments given by the course and they are about translating sentences
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific assignments given by the course.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the phrase 'competence in dominating Chinese' instead of 'competence in speaking Chinese', resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，而且我還被要求加強我的口說以及寫作能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So back to the message. You said that it is your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我還記得這個句子當我拿這個中文句子的時候，我不知道怎麼把它翻成英文你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說總是比較難了解我需要一些幫助，所以我向我的同事請求幫助我請她幫我翻這個句子，然後將答案用簡訊傳給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'to translate that sentence for me'.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	Not adapting the idiomatic expression 'to ask for help' to the target language.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean you asked how to translate the sentence to your colleague and she sent the answer to you through texts, right?That is to say, the text is only an answer for an assignment.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那封簡訊只是我一份作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'homework' in their translation.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
 Now, please look at the page 14 to 16 of the investigatory file.Please look at them. They are the content of the messages. Are these messages all sent for doing the homework?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，這些簡訊的功用都是為了幫助我完成作業
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'messages' is translated as '簡訊' which means 'text messages' instead of 'assignments'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the purpose of the messages was to complete assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then the wife suspected that you have an affair with your colleague 彩燕王. What is your opinion?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '王彩燕' as '彩燕王', reversing the order of the name.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事情真的是想太多了我知道她對我的養家能力非常不滿我希望庭上可以知道，在我在進修的時候，她從來沒有提供任何幫助給我她很不願意幫助我完成我的進修學業如果她有願意幫忙的話，我就沒有必要我問同事了我認為她要為這些誤解負責
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'blamed' as '負責' instead of '指責'

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your responses, it seems that there are some problems between you and your wife.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
 我們剛結婚的時候，我們的確過得很開心但我的就業卻是個問題我嘗試在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是卻沒有辦法有很穩定的工作時數所以我的工作就變成我們兩個之間很大的問題我們常常為這件事情吵架她並不相信我已經盡力了 她完全沒辦法理解我遇到的困難和挫折
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我們的確過得很開心但我的就業卻是個問題' (We did have some good time, but my employment is a problem).
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我們常常為這件事情吵架' (We fought from time to time over this issue). The verb '吵架' (fought) should agree with the subject '我們' (we) in number.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence '她完全沒辦法理解我遇到的困難和挫折' (She completely can't understand the difficulties and frustrations I have faced). The word '完全' (completely) is not necessary and changes the meaning of the sentence.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s go back to the Master degree course you just mentioned.When did you begin the course of the Master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春季的時候開始上課的她是一個兩年的課程我應該要在2012年12月的時候完成這課程但是我並沒有完成這個學業，因為我有兼職工作，造成我沒有時間完成我的作業如同我之前所說的，我老婆並不很支持我我覺我是一個人孤軍奮戰地追求這個學業我感到很累而且很挫折
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我覺我是一個人孤軍奮戰地追求這個學業' should be '我覺得我是一個人孤軍奮戰地追求這個學業'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence: '我在2010年春季的時候開始上課的她是一個兩年的課程' should be '我在2010年春季開始了一個為期兩年的課程'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the program was not finished.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the speaker became tired and frustrated.

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the program should have been finished in December 2012.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the speaker felt alone in pursuing the degree.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You said the degree is a two-year program and you failed to finish it.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'failed' should agree with the subject 'you' in the past tense.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我當時沒有辦法完成要求的課程
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
Then, when did the last semester you registered end?

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個學期結束在2012年的秋季
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我最後一個學期在2012年的秋季結束。'

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, since your course ended on fifth, December, 2012, after that, you shouldn’t have any assignment, should you? However, the messages you texted with your co-worker continued six months after you finished the course.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the year 2012 in the translation.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我雖然沒有完成那個學業，但這並不代表我不想增進我自己的語言能力啊雖然我沒有完成這個學業，我還是想要增進我的語言能力，所以我就開始自修
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of studying Chinese in their own.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Even that you didn't finished the degree, you still wanted to improve your Chinese, is that right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'finished' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'didn't finish' instead of 'didn't finished'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'want' in the translation, which is an important detail in conveying the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，就是為什麼我會尋求我同事的幫忙
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the character of your co-worker is more like a tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'home tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她並不只是一個家教，她是我真正的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her money?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you pay her money?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經想付她錢，但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經想付她錢，但她拒絕了'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn't pay her, why did she text you back in such a midnight? Does it already beyond co-woker's relationship?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural norms and expectations

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這也就是為什麼我說她是一個很支持我的朋友嘛她願意犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學習中文
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '支持' (support) does not accurately convey the meaning of 'using her own time to help me learn Chinese'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '她願意犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學習中文，這也就是為什麼我說她是一個很支持我的朋友嘛。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是，我仍然在那裡任職
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does the co-worker, 彩燕王, still work there, too?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject and verb do not agree in number.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她還那裡任職，但是我們並沒有一起搭檔教學了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是我們並沒有一起搭檔教學了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any further witness to subpoena or investigation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is there any further witness or evidence to subpoena or investigate, prosecutor?'

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want subpoena the co-worker, 彩燕王, form the伯元cram school as a witness. I want her to explain the relationship between the defendant and her. I also want her to explain the context of these messages and the purpose.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'to subpoena' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'subpoena' instead of 'subpoenaing' in the translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'form' instead of 'from' in the translation, resulting in a mismatched meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the messages in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the messages in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintill, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school did take some actions about their relationship.They even did try to persuade 彩燕王 to resign. I don't know if there is a posibility to confirm this thing.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女王' as '彩燕王', which changes the meaning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'did' before the subject 'the cram school', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'more' before 'actions', which changes the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'even' before 'did try', which changes the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'if' before 'there is a possibility', which changes the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'to' before 'confirm', which changes the meaning.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendent, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?Now the situation is that your course already ended on fifth, December, 2012.There is no reson that you texted each other for helping you with your assignments.Especially, the messages you texted each other are after nine p.m. It is very doubtfull.Do you have any evidence that may help for your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Now the situation is that your course already ended on fifth, December, 2012.' is incorrect. It should be 'Now the situation is that your course ended on December fifth, 2012.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋' as 'There is no reson that you texted each other for helping you with your assignments.' does not accurately convey the meaning. It should be translated as 'There is no reason to use doing assignments as an excuse to explain.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Especially, the messages you texted each other are after nine p.m.' is incorrect. It should be 'Especially, the messages you texted each other were after nine p.m.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'It is very doubtfull.' is incorrect. It should be 'It is very doubtful.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'ended' in the sentence 'Now the situation is that your course already ended on fifth, December, 2012.' should be in the past tense. It should be 'ended' instead of 'end'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant's master's degree, which is an important detail in the original text.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不出任何可以幫助我的證據就如同我之前說的，我和我同事之間的溝通很簡單 我只是想要增進我的語言能力並加強中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只是想要增進我的語言能力並加強中文，我想不出任何可以幫助我的證據。'

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So we set the next cout date at four thirty p.m. on ninth, June, 2014 to ask questions to the witness.Plaintiff and defendant, please show your attendence at that day.If necessary, you can have your own lawyers. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我明白。
Yes, I do.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re here for the adultery case, preparatory procedure. the plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case.it is mainly because she thinks that her husband, John Anderson, has an intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school.the plaintiff also found some intimate messages in the defendant’s cell phone.in addition, the defendant also made up reasons for extra working hours, and held tele-conferencing very often.What the plaintiff has found is beyond co-workers’ relationship.Therefore, she filed the case.the defendant, your wife filed you with adultery case. What’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'the plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case.it is mainly because she thinks that her husband, John Anderson, has an intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school.' The correct word order should be 'The plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case mainly because she thinks that her husband, John Anderson, has an intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'the plaintiff also found some intimate messages in the defendant’s cell phone.in addition, the defendant also made up reasons for extra working hours, and held tele-conferencing very often.' The correct word order should be 'In addition, the plaintiff also found some intimate messages in the defendant’s cell phone. The defendant also made up reasons for extra working hours and held tele-conferencing very often.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant's plea in the original text.

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the main focus is to find out details about your communication. another focus would be seeing if the behavior that you both had done constitute adultery or not.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omits the specific details of asking the defendant and their colleague about their communication.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user incorrectly places the phrase 'another focus would be' in the middle of the sentence instead of at the beginning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user fails to mention the purpose of clarifying whether there was an extramarital affair between the defendant and their colleague.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user does not include the question of whether the defendant and their colleague understood the procedure.

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you been married?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about asking if the plaintiff has children.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve been married for four years, and we don’t have any child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'we don't have any children' instead of 'we don't have any child'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
i met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I met my husband in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker is also from Taiwan.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past few years, he works as a Portuguese teacher in Taiwan. Is that right?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'works' should be in the past tense 'worked' to match the time frame mentioned in the original text.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
He was a Portuguese teacher when we met. After our marriage, he kept on being a Portuguese teacher. But since Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so he stopped teaching. Sometimes he didn’t work for one or two months. Later on, because he wanted to have a stable income, he started to teach English. Because his mother tongue is not English, he seeked an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Because his mother tongue is not English, he seeked an advanced degree' is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Because his mother tongue is not English, he sought an advanced degree.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the husband's decision to teach English was motivated by the desire for a stable income.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he’s seeking an advanced degree, so he decided to study in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that studying for an advanced degree means studying in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. he hopes to teach English in Taiwan. What he really wants to obtain is an TESOL degree. He found a distance learning program in California online. So that he wouldn’t have to go to the states in order to get the degree. He only has to get it through distance online learning. After the program, he will obtain the master degree. His plan is through this program of TESOL, he could find a job as an English teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '關於英語教學的' as 'TESOL degree' instead of 'about English teaching'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '遠距教學課程' (distance learning program) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of '函授的方式' (through correspondence) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user skipped the mention of '在完成所有的學分之後' (after completing all the credits) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of '透過這樣子的一個美國學位' (through this kind of American degree) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作' (find a job as an English teacher in Taiwan) in their translation.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what’s the relationship between him and the person he has affair with?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word '外遇對象' which means 'person he has affair with'.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They’re colleague in the same cram school. The school arranged a system. They require a Chinese teacher to work with a foreign teacher, and she is his partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'They are colleagues in the same cram school.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'They're colleague in the same cram school.' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'They are colleagues in the same cram school.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the arrangement of a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher working together in the cram school.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not mention that the woman is the Chinese teacher in his class.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know their affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？' as 'How did you know their affair?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The word 'affair' in English refers to a romantic or sexual relationship outside of marriage, whereas the original text does not specify the nature of the situation being referred to.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At the very beginning, I noticed that he usually worked extra hours. I’ve asked him about this several times. It is a cram school. Why did he work that late? He told me that because he has a Chinese partner, he needs to negotiate some issues with her. At the very beginning, I trust him. Later on, I found that he often got some phone calls. He wouldn’t take them until he is away from me. Then I started to doubt everything, so I checked his phone book.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the husband works at a cram school and the reason for his extra hours is because he has a Chinese partner to communicate with.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the fact that the wife checked her husband's phone because she started to doubt him.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there anything weird you found?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'weird' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his calling history, I usually saw the same number. Then I was curious about his messages. After that, I found he texted a girl almost every day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'calling history' instead of 'communication record'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they checked the messages because they saw the same number in the communication record.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Even if they texted each other every day, is that really wrong? Or you found something wrong in their message content?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the meaning of the original text

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they were normal messages, I’ll just get through it. But he’s a married person, how can he receive intimate messages from a girl? Previously I have provided the court with some messages. They should be in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了' as 'If they were normal messages, I’ll just get through it', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢?' as 'how can he receive intimate messages from a girl?', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the court with some messages in the translation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see page 13 on document 1. There are some messages. Defendant, please check. Are they the messages in your cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages on page 13.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的它們是
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '它們' is used instead of '這是' which means 'this is'.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I would like to ask some questions about the messages. The first one was sent on 9:50 PM, November, 31 in 2012, and it is from the number 0958-932. It wrote 我真的很想你 I really miss you. What’s your explanation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
是我同事傳來的。我記得那時候我請了兩天假，他有點擔心。也就是為甚麼他傳這封簡訊給我，他在美國接受教育，所以她比較開放。這就是他講話的方式，至於我所說的「愛」，這就是我們關心別人的方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural references or symbols

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that the message sender was educated in the states, so her ideas were quite westernized. Then she was quite open-minded about expressing her love. So the word “our love” doesn’t mean too much. Is that right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of '我的愛' (my love) and assumes it doesn't have a special meaning.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然啊，這在好朋友之間很平常，我們都是這麼說的。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the last sentence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the translation of the last sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，他有點擔心我，我們是工作上的搭檔耶。當我離開工作兩天，他當然會想我啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'he' is used instead of 'she', resulting in a mismatched meaning.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So do you mean that because you had two days off and away from work. So she’s worried. Without your assistance at work, so she misses you. That’s all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，那就是當時的情境，整個簡訊並沒有甚麼大不了
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Then the second message that we’re showing is sent at 11:55 PM on 13, January on 2013. It’s also from the same number. The content is “I want to..我想要你在我身邊，我們甚麼時候可以真正在一起？” can you tell me why she wrote like this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他寫這封簡訊給我因為他想要問我這個句子的…
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So she wrote the message to you because you asked her to help you with a project?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the context of asking for help with a project.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太先前所說的，我正在進修碩士。在那個學程之中，我要修三十學分才能取的學位。很自然地，我就要寫作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about completing assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you make it clear that what is your master degree about?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'make it clear' in the translation.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
是英語教學。在這個課程中，大部分的課程都跟英語教學有關，然後其中一部分是跟語言及文化的能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you’re seeking a master degree on English teaching, and there’s some courses about cultures and languages. Is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，至少有三門課跟文化還有語言相關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
And this kind of cultural courses, what’s the assignment like?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
文化及溝通課程的作業每個人都不一樣。以我自己為例，我目前人在台灣，然後正在攻讀英語教學的碩士學位。為了要達成這個目標而且證明我的能力，我必須要證明我有中文的能力。所以很多我的作業是翻成中文的句子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '以我自己為例，我目前在台灣，然後正在攻讀英語教學的碩士學位。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan. So the exercise in the courses ask you to show… that’s the reason why you need to finish some homework. And the homework is mainly about Chinese and English translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對，我要磨練自己的口說還有寫作技巧。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So let’s go back to the message. This is your homework, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這個句子的時候，我不知道怎麼用英文表達。因為有些中文字對外國來講，很難去辨認。我需要幫助，所以我就請我同事幫我。我請他幫我翻譯這個句子，然後用訊息傳給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'sent me the answer' is not accurately conveyed in the translation.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The translation does not accurately convey the difficulty of recognizing Chinese words for foreigners.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that because you had an assignment, and you turned to her for help, so she sent the message for you. Is that right? In other words, the message is the answer of the homework, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那只是作業的答案。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then we’re going to see on page 14 to page 16. All the messages. Please verify the content. Are they all the answers of your homework?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，他們都是我的作業，全部都只有一個目的，就是為了完成我的作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
For the point of your wife saying you have an affair with your colleague 彩燕王. What’s your explanation?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '王彩燕' as '彩燕王', which is the incorrect word order.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
她想太多了，我知道他對我支持家庭並不滿意。我想讓庭上了解的是，在我碩士課程的剛開始，他就沒有提供任何協助。她不想要幫我完成學位。如果他願意幫一點點忙的話，我就不用請我同事幫忙。關於這一切的誤解，他要負最大的責任。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我知道他對我支持家庭並不滿意' should be '我知道她對我支持家庭並不滿意'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Incorrect pronoun usage in the sentence: '我想讓庭上了解的是' should be '我想讓庭上了解的是'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'wife' in the sentence: '我知道他對我支持家庭並不滿意' should be '我知道她對我支持家庭並不滿意'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'degree' in the sentence: '她不想要幫我完成學位' should be '她不想要幫我完成學位'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'colleague' in the sentence: '如果他願意幫一點點忙的話，我就不用請我同事幫忙' should be '如果他願意幫一點點忙的話，我就不用請我同事幫忙'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'misunderstanding' in the sentence: '關於這一切的誤解，他要負最大的責任' should be '關於這一切的誤解，他要負最大的責任'.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, the relationship between both of you doesn’t seem good.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚的時候，我們的確有段開心的日子。但我的就業造成了一些問題。我想要在台灣交葡萄牙文，但是授課時數並不穩定。所以我的工作便造就了一切問題。我們常為這件事吵架。他不相信我已經盡了全力，我也不知道怎麼讓他了解我的挫折還有困難。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們常為這件事吵架' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們常為這件事情吵架'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So let’s go back to the master degree program. When did the program start?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question about when the program ended and if the user obtained a degree.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年的春天開始的。是兩年的課程。我在2012的十二月應該要結束。因為我那時候有兼職的工作，沒有足夠的時間完成作業，所以沒有準時畢業。如我先前所說的，我太太不願意幫忙。我覺得我是獨自一人追求那個學位。我很累也很挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我在2012的十二月應該要結束'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the program was not finished.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for not finishing the program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling tired and frustrated.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling alone in pursuing the degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the lack of support from their wife.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean it is a two-year degree, and you didn’t finish it in time. Why is that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法完成課堂作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when was the last semester you registered?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
是在2012年的秋天。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If what you have said is true, the last day of your semester should be on December 15th, 2012. So after the program, you won’t have any assignment. Is that right? But the intimate messages continued even six months later after your program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'So after the program, you won’t have any assignment. Is that right?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the correct end date of the semester, which is December 5th, 2012.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the correct duration of the messages, which is six months.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the correct reason for the continuation of the messages between colleagues.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我沒有作業了，我也想要精進我的中文。雖然我沒有辦法取得那個學位了，我還是想要持續進修，成為獨立學習中文的人。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of failing the program in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '就算我沒有作業了' (even when I failed the program) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '我還是想要持續進修' (I still wanted to continue studying).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '持續進修' (continue studying) as '成為獨立學習中文的人' (become an independent Chinese learner), which does not convey the same meaning.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even if you don’t have the courses, you still want to improve your Chinese, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為甚麼我請我同事幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So she is like a tutor for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是像一個家教，他也像一個真正的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
我想要付錢，可是他拒絕了
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I offered to pay her but she declined,' the user's translation says 'I want to pay, but she refused.'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why does she want to send the messages at midnight when most people are asleep. Isn’t it beyond what a co-worker would do?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我說他非常支持我啊。他用他自己的時間幫我學中文
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'she' as '他' (he) instead of '她' (she).
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used '非常支持我' (very support me) instead of '非常支持我學中文' (very supportive of me learning Chinese).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'using her own time' in the translation.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Did you still work in the same cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
對
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of specifying the place of work.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
So your colleague 彩燕王also work there now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
他還是在那邊上班，可是我們不是夥伴了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '可是我們不是夥伴了' instead of '我們不是夥伴了可是'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there anything that you want the court to investigate? Or any person to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena his colleague 彩燕王 who is working at 伯元 cram school as a witness. I would like to ask her to explain the messages and her relationship between the defendant.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the purpose of the messages and the background of their writing.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect word order in the sentence.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there anything that you want the court to investigate?

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has taken some action for the affair of them. And I also heard that they persuaded the woman 彩燕王 to resign. Is there the possibility to ask the cram school to explain about that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女王彩燕離職' as 'the woman 彩燕王 to resign'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the relationship between the two people in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate? The thing is the program ended on December 15, 2012. You can’t just explain your relationship with 彩燕王 through the purpose of finishing the homework. Especially your messages were usually sent during 9 to 12 PM. That is really doubtful. Do you have any evident that may help you in the case.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The thing is the program ended on December 15, 2012' is incorrect. It should be 'The thing is, the program ended on December 15, 2012.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '王彩燕' as '彩燕王', which is a mismatched meaning. The correct translation is '彩燕王'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Especially your messages were usually sent during 9 to 12 PM' is incorrect. It should be 'Especially, your messages were usually sent during 9 to 12 PM.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after 'Especially' in the sentence 'Especially your messages were usually sent during 9 to 12 PM.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '證據' as 'evident', which is an incorrect word choice. The correct translation is 'evidence'.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到法庭能替我調查的事情。如我所說的，我和我同事的通訊，理由都很簡單。我只想要精進我的中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想不到法庭能替我調查的事情。'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about wanting to improve their language ability and continue learning Chinese.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court date would be on 4:30 PM, June, 9th, 2014 for the inquiry procedure. Please make sure that you will be here. If necessary, you can have a lawyer with you.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '4:30 PM, June 9th, 2014'.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for preparatory procedure of adultery. The plaintiff files this case. The main reason that she files this case is because her husband has intimate relationship with his colleague. The plaintiff found some message in her husband’s cell phone. And her husband will use some excuse to chat with his colleague on the internet by tele-conferencing way. The message found by plaintiff showed that the relationship between her husband and his colleague is beyond colleague relationship. So, she files this case. Defendant, for what your wife said, what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The plaintiff files this case.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '準備程序' as 'preparatory procedure of adultery' instead of 'preparatory procedure for adultery'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'has' instead of 'is having' in the sentence: 'her husband has intimate relationship with his colleague'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'extramarital' in the sentence: 'The plaintiff files this case.'
grammar and structure	preposition errors	The user used the incorrect preposition 'on' instead of 'through' in the sentence: 'her husband will use some excuse to chat with his colleague on the internet by tele-conferencing way.'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user added the phrase 'by tele-conferencing way' which is not present in the original text.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated '通姦罪' as 'adultery' instead of 'adultery offense'.

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Of course, not guilty.'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
For today’s preparatory procedure, we will understand the details of intimate message between defendant and his colleague. The main purpose is to make clear that the defendant and his colleague is adultery. Do both parties know the procedure?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'intimate message' as 'details of intimate message'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'make clear that the defendant and his colleague is adultery' as 'to make clear that the defendant and his colleague are engaged in adultery'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form 'is' instead of 'are' in 'the defendant and his colleague is adultery'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the purpose of the procedure, which is to determine if the defendant and his colleague are engaged in adultery

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long you got married with your husband? Do both of you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'got' should be changed to 'have' to match the subject 'you'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We got married for four years, and we don’t have children.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'got' should agree with the subject 'we'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or other country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you and your husband get married in Taiwan or another country?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We got known each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan, and the main purpose is teaching Portugese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'We got known each other in Taiwan.' It should be 'We got to know each other in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'to be' in the sentence 'Four years ago, he came to Taiwan.' It should be 'Four years ago, he came to Taiwan.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'teaching' instead of 'learning' in the sentence 'the main purpose is teaching Portuguese.' It should be 'the main purpose is learning Portuguese.'

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
For these years, did your husband just teach Portugese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we just meet each other, he was teaching Portugese. After we got married, he was still teaching Portugese. However, the Portugese class is not very common in Taiwan, so his teaching hours is not very stable. Sometimes, a period between the class will be 1~2 month. For fixed income, he started want to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he wanted to get an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'When we just meet each other' should be 'When we just met each other'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'he was teaching Portugese' should be 'he taught Portugese'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'After we got married, he was still teaching Portugese' should be 'After we got married, he continued teaching Portugese'.
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	Missing article in the sentence: 'However, the Portugese class is not very common in Taiwan' should be 'However, the Portugese class is not very common in Taiwan'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Sometimes, a period between the class will be 1~2 month' should be 'Sometimes, there will be a period of 1-2 months between classes'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in the sentence: 'For fixed income, he started want to teach English' should be 'For a stable income, he started wanting to teach English'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in the sentence: 'However, his mother tongue is not English, so he wanted to get an advanced degree' should be 'However, as his mother tongue is not English, he wanted to get an advanced degree in English'.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
The advanced degree that you just mentioned means that he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'advanced degree' instead of 'further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he tried to get a degree of teaching English. He found a learning program on the internet from California. This program makes him can have on-line learning, and he didn’t need to go to Unite States for these classes. After the classes, he can get the degree. For this plan, he tried to get the degree and find a related job.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'This program makes him can have on-line learning'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the specific degree that he is trying to obtain
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the specific job he is trying to find

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship that he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in the cram school. The cram school set the Chinese teacher and foreign teacher program. And that woman is his partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
In the beginning, I just know that my husband would stay in the school for more hours. I asked him so many times: why he should stay in the school for more hours. It’s just a cram school. He told me that he has a partner, and he has to communicate with his partner for long time. In the beginning, I didn’t think too much. After that, I found he would get some calls in home. And he would avoid get the phone call around me, and he would get the phone call in study room. It made me very suspicious, and I started to check his cell phone.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '美語補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'English language school'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used incorrect subject-verb agreement in the sentence 'I asked him so many times: why he should stay in the school for more hours.' It should be 'I asked him so many times: why he should stay in the school for more hours?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the husband receives calls after coming home.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the critical context that the husband avoids taking phone calls in front of the user and goes to the study room to talk.
omission or addition	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user neglected to translate the term '中師' which refers to a Chinese teacher or instructor.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find any evidence in his cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of evidence in the original text.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I used to see the same number in his cell phone. I am so suspicious, so I started to check his message. After that, I found that he almost sent the message to same woman every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '常常看到' as 'used to see' instead of 'often see'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user checked his messages after being suspicious
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the information that the person in question is sending messages to a woman

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
What’s inappropriate thing in the message?
inappropriate cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If that’s a common message, it’s alright. But he got married, how can he have intimate message with others? I just provided some message to the court, and it supposed to be in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的簡訊' as 'common message' instead of 'ordinary text message'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court, which is an important detail in the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see the investigatory file one of page13. There are some messages. Defendant, please see these pages. Is from your cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific mention of the text messages in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'see' before the subject 'Defendant', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機裡面的簡訊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I have some questions about these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50PM on November 31, 2012. And it’s from the cell phone number 0958-932… And the content is “我非常想你，我的愛” what that means?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
恩，那是由我同事傳給我的簡訊。我記得那時候我有兩天的休假，他非常擔心我，這就是為什麼他傳這個簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國接受教育，她非常開放。那就是她說話的方式。關於簡訊裡面的字眼，那只是我們稱呼對方的一種方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So, you mean that because she stayed in the foreign country, her thinking way is westernized. And the way she showed the feeling is open-minded. So, there is no further explanation for “my love,” is that right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of '我的愛' as having no special meaning, when in fact it does.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
並沒有甚麼其他的意思，那只是好朋友之間的一種稱呼，就僅只於這樣而已。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the sentence before that?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就如同我之前所說，她很擔心我，而且我們只是同事當我連續休了兩天假後，她只是很擔心我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'partners at work' as '只是同事' which means 'just colleagues' instead of '合作夥伴' which means 'partners'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverbial phrase '就如同我之前所說' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was away for two days, which is an important detail in the original text.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So, you mean that because you had two days off, she was worried about you and sent that message for you? Because she didn’t have your assistance, she missed you. That’s all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the person missed the user's assistance.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
沒錯，就是這樣。簡訊的內容並不是甚麼大問題。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'no big deal' is translated as '並不是甚麼大問題', which is a literal translation but does not capture the casual and dismissive tone of the original phrase.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was from the same person. It was sent at 11:55 PM, in January 13 2013. 訊息內容是〝我好希望你在我身邊，我們甚麼時候才能有正當的關係呢?〞What that sentence means?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她發這樣的簡訊給我只是想要讓我知道，這樣的句子如何用另外一個語言來表達。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that the purpose of message just want to help you to do the assignment, what’s that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我之前所說的，我有一個遠距教學的課程。在那個課程中我需要修習三十個學分才能完成那個課程。當然在課程中，我必須要完成一些作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我之前所說的，我有一個遠距教學的課程。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'Master's program' as '遠距教學的課程' does not accurately convey the meaning. 'Master's program' refers to a specific type of academic program, while '遠距教學的課程' simply means 'distance learning course'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the completion of 30 credits is required before receiving the degree.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you just explain about your degree?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我修習的課程是英語教學。課程主要的內容是英語教學、文化以及語言能力。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' instead of '計畫' or '方案'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我修習的課程是英語教學。' instead of '我修習的課程是英語教學。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about some courses being related to culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So, the degree that you got is TESOL, and there are some culture classes in that degree, is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
沒錯，我記得大概有三個課程是有關於文化和溝通的部分。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What’s the assignment about these classes?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'assignment' in their translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
在課程中，指派的作業對於每個人來說都不太一樣。舉我的例子來說，我是一個在台灣想要教英文的人。為了這個目的我必須在課程中展現我有能力表達好中文。因此，我的作業中有很多是關於中文翻譯的部分。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '舉我的例子來說，我是一個在台灣想要教英文的人。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments were for culture and communication courses.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '指派' to translate 'assignments', which is not the correct word choice. The correct word choice should be '作業'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'good command of Chinese' as '有能力表達好中文', which does not accurately convey the meaning of having a good command of Chinese. The correct translation should be '中文能力很好' or '中文掌握得很好'.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to have the competence of … For that purpose, you had to complete the assignment about translation, is that right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'you have to have' instead of 'you had to have'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific language proficiency required for teaching English in Taiwan.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，我必須增進我的說和寫能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, we just go back to that sentence. You mean that the sentence is just for your assignment, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
沒錯我記得那個句子。當我看到那個中文句子後，我並不知道那句子的中文意思是甚麼意思，你知道的阿!有些中文句子對於外國人來說是非常困難的，我需要一些幫助，所以我請我同事幫忙，我請我的同事幫忙翻譯並以簡訊方式寄給我。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural references or symbols

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So, you mean that you just asked her to translate. And she just translated it and sent it to you, is that right? This message is just the answer for the assignment, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now, we are going to show you the investigatory file one page14~16. Please see the content of these pages. So, the main purpose of these messages just for the assignment, so she sent that messages for you, is that right, is that right?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，所有的簡訊內容都只是為了要完成我的作業而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation of adultery between your colleague and you filed by your wife?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我的太太對於這件事情非常感冒，我知道她對於這件事情危害家庭有很大的不悅。我想要告訴庭上的是，她其實對於我的這個並沒有甚麼太大的幫助，他並不希望我得到學位，要是如果她有一點意願幫助我，我也不用去請我的同事幫忙，我覺得她應該因為這件事情遭到譴責。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'thinks too much of' as '感冒' (catch a cold) instead of '太過於重視' (attach too much importance to)
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'supporting the family' as '危害家庭' (harm the family) instead of '經濟支持家庭' (financially support the family)

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, both of you didn’t get along with each other …
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們剛結婚不久時，我們過得很開心。但問題就出在我的工作，我只是想要在台灣教葡萄牙文。但我的授課時數真的很少，所以我的工作成為我們相處之間的問題，我們為了這件事情一直爭吵，他不相信我已經盡了最大努力，我不知道要怎麼跟她說我的挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我只是想要在台灣教葡萄牙文' is incorrect. It should be '我只是想要在台灣教葡萄牙文'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '但我的授課時數真的很少'. The verb '很少' should agree with the subject '授課時數', so it should be '授課時數很少'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	There is a tense error in the sentence '所以我的工作成為我們相處之間的問題'. The verb '成為' should be in the past tense to match the time frame of '剛結婚不久時', so it should be '所以我的工作成了我們相處之間的問題'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	There is a pronoun error in the sentence '我不知道要怎麼跟她說我的挫折'. The pronoun '我的' should be '我' to maintain consistency with the previous pronoun usage.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
We just go back to the degree that you mentioned. When did you start you your program? Did you get the degree?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific master's program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention when the program ended.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention whether they obtained the degree or not.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在102的春季課程開始的，那是一個為期兩年的課程。我必須在103年的12月完成課程。我並沒有完成我的課程，因為我有一個兼職工作，所以我時間不夠去做那些作業。就如同我之前所說，我的老婆並不支持我，我覺得我一直在靠我自己的能力去追求那些課程，我開始感到很疲倦而且挫折。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	春季課程開始的 -> started the program in Spring
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	102的春季 -> Spring 2010
semantic conversion	omission of details	我 -> I
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	那是一個為期兩年的課程 -> It was a two-year program
semantic conversion	omission of details	103年的12月 -> December 2012
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	我並沒有完成我的課程 -> I didn't finish the program
semantic conversion	omission of details	因為我有一個兼職工作 -> because I was working part-time
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	所以我時間不夠去做那些作業 -> and didn't get enough time to do my course assignments
semantic conversion	omission of details	就如同我之前所說 -> Like I said
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	我的老婆並不支持我 -> my wife has never been very supportive
semantic conversion	omission of details	我覺得我一直在靠我自己的能力去追求那些課程 -> I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself
semantic conversion	omission of details	我開始感到很疲倦而且挫折 -> I became too tired and too frustrated

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So, you mean that the program is for two years. And you didn’t finish that program, what’s the reason?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我不能完成課程中的所有作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'requirement' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
What is the last registration semester of your program?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個註冊學期是在103年。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'fall 2012' as '103年', which is incorrect and does not convey the same meaning.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If all you said is true, it supposed that you would not have any assignment after December 5 2012. The message sent between your colleague and you last six months after the semester, what’s the reason?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
恩，我沒有完成那個課程並不代表我想要停止精進我的語言能力。即使我沒有完成那個課程，我還是想要精進我的中文能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '即使我沒有完成那個課程，我還是想要精進我的中文能力。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So, you meant that even if you failed to get that degree, you want to make your Chinese more fluent by yourself, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
沒錯，那就是我為什麼要請我同事幫忙的原因。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
You mean that your colleague is just a role of tutor, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她並不只是一個家教而已，她也是我的好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay for her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經試圖給她錢，但是她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經試圖給她錢，但是她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay to her, why would she send that message for you even if in the mid-night. Is that beyond co-worker relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我之前所說，她只是一個熱心助人的朋友。她運用很多時間來幫助我學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我之前所說，她只是一個熱心助人的朋友。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific subject of the sentence, which is 'you'.

Yes, I am still working there.
沒錯，我還在那裡教書。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is that colleague still in that cram school?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '服務' as 'cram school' instead of 'work/service'.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
沒錯，她仍然在那裏工作，但我們已經不再搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不再搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經不再搭檔了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Does the prosecutor want to have more any evidence or witness?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena the witness of defendant’s colleague, Tsai Yan Wang. We want her to explain the background and purpose of that message.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the colleague working at Bo Yuan Cram School and the relationship between the witness and the defendant.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'want' instead of 'wants' to match the subject 'I'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Does the defendant want the court to find some evidences for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff as the one requesting the court to find evidence.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I just heard that the cram school took some steps for them. And they tried to persuade his colleague to leave the cram school. Can we check this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女王彩燕' as 'his colleague' instead of 'Queen Caiyan'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'the cram school' before 'leave' instead of after.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you want the court to find some evidences for you? The situation is that you finished the program on December 5 2012. You should not have the excuses of doing homework for sending the message. Particularly, both of you sent the message for each other after 9:00 PM, it’s very doubted. Do you have any evidence for your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Do you want the court to find some evidences for you?' is incorrect. It should be 'Do you want the court to find any evidence for you?'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the sentence 'The situation is that you finished the program on December 5 2012.' is incorrect. It should be 'The situation is that you finished the program on December 5, 2012.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'evidences' should be 'evidence' in the sentence 'Do you want the court to find some evidences for you?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'You should not have the excuses of doing homework for sending the message.' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'You should not use doing homework as an excuse for your text message interaction.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'it’s very doubted' is an omission of the details in the original text. It should be 'it raises suspicions.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'Do you have any evidence for your case?' is an omission of the details in the original text. It should be 'Do you have any evidence that can help your case?'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我無法想到有甚麼證據可以幫助我的案子，就如同我之前所說，我和我同事之間的簡訊只是平凡的簡訊而已。我只是想精進我的中文能力而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court's investigation and the purpose of the communication.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '就如同我之前所說' in the wrong position in the sentence.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So, the next court day will be set at 4:30, in June 9 2014, and it will be the witness inquiry procedure. Please both of you should make it. If it’s necessary, both of you can have lawyers, is that clear?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect date and year

我明白。
Yes.

I understand.

今天庭期到此結束。

semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user added the phrase 'falls under the poverty line' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'falls' instead of 'fall' to agree with the subject 'financial status'.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparation procedure of adultery. The plaintiff, Yu Hua Chen, filed this case. The plaintiff suspect her husband, John Anderston, has a beyond co-worker’s relation with his co-worker of the cram school, and the plaintiff found some intimate messages in the defendant’s cell phone. In addition, the defendant will always make up reasons for going out in the with Wang Cai Yan and also has the tele-conference with her in the midnight. According to the information found by the plaintiff, she found that their relationship is beyond co-worker’s relationship. Therefore, she filed for this case. Defendant, your wife suspected you are having an affair with another, and she filed for the case of adultery.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	beyond co-worker’s relation should be extramarital affair
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	tele-conference should be video call
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of the defendant's response or defense

Not guilty, of course.
我當然是無罪的啊!
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'am' should agree with the subject '我' (I), so it should be '我當然是無罪的啊!'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the main purpose of this procedure is to seek out the detail information to find out whether the defendant is having an affaire with Cai Yan Wang and it might constitute the adultery, do you understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '被告與其同事之通訊細節' as 'detail information to find out whether the defendant is having an affaire with Cai Yan Wang'.

我明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, I want to ask the plaintiff, how long have you married, and do you kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have already married for four years, and we do not have kid.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should be in the past tense to agree with the subject 'we'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker is referring to her husband.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the fact that they do not have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Do you marry your husband in Taiwan or in other country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you marry your husband in Taiwan or in another country?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan as a Portuguese teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker is also from Taiwan.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
During those years, did he teach Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met, he was a Portuguese teacher, and after we married, he still taught Portuguese. But Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan; therefore his teaching hours are not stable. Sometimes he might did not have any class between one or two months. Because he wanted to make our financial status more stable, therefore he started to taught English. But his mother tongue is not English; therefore, he sought an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'he might did not have any class'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in 'he still taught Portuguese'
grammar and structure	tense errors	inconsistent use of past tense and present tense in 'he still taught Portuguese' and 'he started to taught English'
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	missing article 'a' before 'Portuguese teacher'
grammar and structure	preposition errors	incorrect use of preposition 'to' in 'he started to taught English'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'one or two months of classes' in 'Sometimes he might did not have any class between one or two months'
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	repetition of 'he still taught Portuguese' and 'he started to taught English'
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	lack of context for 'he sought an advanced degree'
omission or addition	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	failure to translate 'advanced degree'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mention before that he sought an advanced degree, do you mean he studies a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he hoped to teach English in Taiwan, therefore, he have to get the degree of the TESOL. On the Internet, he found a distance learning program provided by California school. He did not have to go to the US, and can learn on-line. After he finishes the classes, he can get the degree. His plan is to find an English teacher job in Taiwan by getting an US degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the specific degree (TESOL)

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Can you explain the relationship between your husband and the woman in this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in cram school. In the cram school, they have the system of a foreigner teacher partner with a Chinese teacher, and they are partners.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they are having an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I found that my husband started to stay at the cram school for a long time. I asked him many times “It is just a cram school, why did you have to stay there so long?” He told me that because he had to partner with a Chinese teacher, and they had to cooperate with each other. At first, I did not suspect he is having an affair with her. But after a while, I noticed that, my husband would get some phone calls after he came home. When he received those phone calls, he did not speak the phone directly in front of me, instead going to the study room. That is the reason why I checked the information in his cell phone.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '中師搭檔教學' as 'partner with a Chinese teacher' instead of 'cooperate with a Chinese teacher'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the protagonist checked her husband's phone because of her suspicions.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything strange in his cell phone?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
 I saw his phone calls always from one number, so I was curious about the text messages and I checked them. After I checked the messages, I found that he almost chatted with a woman everyday.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通簡訊' as 'chatted with' instead of 'texted with'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
I think it is okay to text messages, is anything wrong in the content?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting the appropriateness of the content

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If those messages’ content are normal, that will be okay. But he is a married man, how could he let a girl to text him some intimate messages? I have provided some content of the messages, I think they might in the investigation file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '已婚的人' as 'married man' instead of 'a married person'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please check page 13, file one. There are some messages content, please check them. Are these your messages from your cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the messages content.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對，這些是我電話中的簡訊。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'message' is translated as '簡訊' which means 'text message' instead of '訊息' which means 'message'.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I have some question about the message content. The first message is from the cell phone 0958-932xxx at 9:50 p.m., on December thirty first, 2012. The content is 我非常想你 可以請你解釋一下嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message. The original message says 'I really miss you, my love,' but the translation says 'I really miss you. Can you explain it to me?'

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事發來的。我記得那陣子，我休了兩天的假。她可能有點擔心吧。這就是她發給我這封簡訊的原因。我同事在美國受過教育，他非常開放，這是她的講話方式啊!至於她稱呼我是她的愛人，這只是她的一個稱呼罷了。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that because the people was educated in the USA, and she is westernized, and she is open minded to express her feeling, so the name, my love, does not mean a lot?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
這只是普通朋友間很常見的稱呼，或者是表達你對你很親密朋友的關心罷了
minor categories of cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous line?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我說啦，她很擔心我，我們是夥伴啊!當我請了兩天的假以後，她當然會開始想我阿。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '開始' (start) should come before the subject '她' (she).

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You are saying that because of your two days off, she texted you this kind of message. Without your help in the work, she missed you a lot. Is that all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the person missed the user a lot due to the user's absence from work.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
這封簡訊就沒甚麼大不了的，內容是很普遍的， 這只是很單純的簡訊。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'no big deal' is translated as '沒甚麼大不了的', which does not capture the casual and nonchalant tone of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The next message was from the same cell phone at 11:55 p.m., on January thirteenth, in 2013.內容是我想要你在我身逼，甚麼時候才能在一起呢? Can you explain the content?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'by my side' as '在我身逼' is incorrect. It should be '在我身邊' or '在我身旁'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'truly together' as '在一起' is correct, but the word '真正' or '真實' could be added to convey the meaning of 'truly' more accurately.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她發簡訊給我，只是為了告訴我功課的中文該如何表達的一句話
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Do you mean that she sent this message to you just to help you with your homework can you explain that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
我太太之前有跟庭上報告過，我正在上遠距離教學。為了得到學位，我必須完成30學分，當然啦，我就必需完成一些功課或者是作業。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	遠距離教學 (distance learning) 被翻譯成了 Master's program (碩士課程)
grammar and structure	word order errors	語序錯誤，將修飾詞放在了被修飾詞之後，例如 '我太太之前有跟庭上報告過' 應該為 '我之前有跟庭上報告過我的太太'
omission or addition	omitting important details	遺漏了 '完成30學分' 這個重要細節

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain that what is your master degree for?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是有關英語教學的。這個學位的課程內容有些是有關英語語言能力的、有些是有關文化跟英語教學。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '碩士學位' is translated as 'program' instead of 'degree'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我的碩士學位是有關英語教學的。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the courses being part of the program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that some courses were related to culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you are saying that in your master degree, the main program is for English competence, but there are some culture classes?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得課程裡有3門課程是有關文化溝通的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我記得課程裡有3門有關文化溝通的課程。'

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
Can you tell me the homework of the culture communication classes?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'homework' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這門課裡，每個學生的作業都是因人而異的。以我自己為例的話，我在台灣想要當一名英文老師，為了達到這個目的，我需要證明我有足夠的語言能力，尤其是對中文的掌握。所以我的功課內容很多是有關中英語間的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '以我自己為例的話' is incorrect. It should be '以我自己為例'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '這門課裡' which is important for the context of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '每個學生的作業都是因人而異的' which provides information about the assignments being different for each student.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '尤其是對中文的掌握' which emphasizes the importance of Chinese language proficiency.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Your plan is to teach in Taiwan. Therefore, you have to prove you have the Chinese competence. So you have to finish some assignments, and that is about translation between Chinese and English, is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of completing assignments as part of the course.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'is' instead of 'are' in the phrase 'assignments is about translation'.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
我還必須加強我的寫作和口語能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, let’s go back to the next point. You said that is your homework, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
我記得這句話。當我拿到這句話的中文時，我不知道要怎麼把它翻成英文。你知道的，中文對外國人來說是很難辨識的，它們都長得一樣。我需要一些幫助，所以我就請我的同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯這句話，再把這句話寄給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by the colleague.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You are saying that you gave your college the Chinese sentence, and she translated it into English and sent it back to you. Is that right? In other words, the content of this message is just a part of your assignment, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
這封簡訊的內容，就只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the message was a text message.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now, please check page 14 to 15 of file one, the content of all messages. Please check those messages. Are they all your assignments, and you ask your co-workers to help you?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
這些簡訊都只有一個目的，就是為了幫助我完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, as for the accuse from you wife that you are having affair with Cai Yan Wang, what is your explanation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了。我知道她覺得我對家庭的付出不夠。我想要強調，再我求學的這段過程，我太太一開始完成沒有支持我。她不希望幫助我完成我的學業，如果她願意幫助我的話，我根本就不需要請我的同事幫我。我覺得她應該為造成這種誤解負責。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '再我求學的這段過程' is incorrect. It should be '我求學的這段過程中'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '完成' should agree with the subject '她', so it should be '她不願意幫助我完成我的學業'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我根本就不需要請我的同事幫我' is a mismatched meaning. It should be '我根本不需要請我的同事幫忙'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase '我覺得她應該為造成這種誤解負責' omits the detail of 'blaming'. It should be '我覺得她應該為這種誤解負責'.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, I think there might be some misunderstanding between you and your wife.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們剛結婚時真的很甜蜜。但我的工作造成我們之間的問題，我試著在台灣教葡萄牙，但我的授課時數一直很不穩定，所以我的工作問題就造成我們兩個之間的不和，我們為了我的工作常常吵架。她不相信我已經近全力在工作了，我也不知道我要怎麼表達我己經…我的沮喪、我的難過
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我試著在台灣教葡萄牙' (I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan). The correct word order should be '我試著在台灣教葡萄牙'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我試著在台灣教葡萄牙' (I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan). The verb '教' (teach) should agree with the subject '我' (I) and be conjugated as '教了' (taught).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence '我試著在台灣教葡萄牙' (I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan). The word '教' (teach) should be translated as 'teaching' instead of 'tried teaching' to accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我們為了我的工作常常吵架' (We fought from time to time over this issue). The correct word order should be '我們常常為了我的工作吵架'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我們為了我的工作常常吵架' (We fought from time to time over this issue). The verb '吵架' (fought) should agree with the subject '我們' (we) and be conjugated as '吵架了' (fought).
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced' in the translation. This important detail is not included in the user's translation.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, let’s back to your master degree. When did you start your master degree? Did you finish? ….When was it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the specific question about whether the person obtained their degree.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年的春天開始課程的。這是一個兩年的課程。我本來應該在2012年的12月拿到學位。可是我並沒有拿到學位，因為我必須在台灣做兼職工作，而我沒有很多時間來做我的作業。像我之前說的，我太太並不支持我。我覺得我在追求學位的時候是一個很孤單的過程，我覺得太疲累、太沮喪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我在2010年的春天開始課程的'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '我本來應該在2012年的12月拿到學位'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '因為我必須在台灣做兼職工作'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated in the sentence '我覺得太疲累、太沮喪'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling alone in the pursuit of the degree in the sentence '我覺得我在追求學位的時候是一個很孤單的過程'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for lack of support from the wife in the sentence '像我之前說的，我太太並不支持我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not having enough time to do course assignments in the sentence '因為我沒有很多時間來做我的作業'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
Did you mean the program is a two-year program but you did not finish the course? Why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the original meaning of the sentence.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法完成課程的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When was your last semester registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋天。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'registration' from the translation.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If you are telling the truth, the last day of your registration was December fifth, 2012. So after the day, basically you do no have any homework, is that right? Can you explain why you kept contacting with your co-worker after the last day of your registration for six months?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '結束日期' as 'registration' instead of 'end date'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'last semester' in the translation
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'basically you do no have any homework'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'text messages' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'after the last day of your registration' in the translation

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
恩..我沒有拿到學位，但不代表我不想增進我的中文能力。雖然我沒有拿到學位，我也想要練習我的中文，所以我一直自學。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有拿到學位，但不代表我不想增進我的中文能力。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'Even when I failed the program' in their translation.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even though you fail to finish the degree, but you still want to improve your Chinese and make you speak Chinese fluently?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，所以我才請我的同事幫忙。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation, which changes the meaning and omits an important detail.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, the role of your co-worker is as your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，還是我一個貼心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我有試著付她錢但是她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有試著付她錢但是她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
So, if you did not pay her, why did she need to text you in the midnight when everyone is sleeping? Does that far beyond co-worker’s relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說他是一個很支持我的朋友。她用她自己私人的時間來幫助我學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我才說她是一個很支持我的朋友。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '他' is used instead of '她', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我還在那家補習班工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
And, does the co-worker, Cai Yan Wang, still work there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Does the co-worker, Cai Yan Wang, still work there?'

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那家補習班工作，但我們現在已經不是夥伴的關係了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們現在已經不是夥伴的關係了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any evidence you need to investigate or any witness to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena Cai Yan Wang, who is still working at the Bo Yuan cram school, as a witness. We want her to explain the reason why she texted those messages, and explain the relationship between she and the defendant.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the crucial information that the purpose of subpoenaing Cai Yan Wang is to have her testify about the relationship between her and the defendant, as well as the background and purpose of the text messages.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user made a subject-verb agreement error by using 'We want her' instead of 'I want her' since the user is the one requesting the subpoena.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there any evidence you want the court to investing for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
 I heard that the cram school has do some action because of their relationship. And there even someone was trying to persuade Cai Yan Wang to leave the cram school. Is it possible to verify the truth?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'company'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'do' before the subject 'the cram school' in the first sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the action was taken by the company.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there any evidence you want to court to investigate for you? The situation is your program was ended on December fifteenth, 2012. There is still no reason for you to keep texting messages with Cai Yan Wang for helping the homework. Especially, most of your messages are after nine o’clock, it is very suspicious. Do you have any evidence to prove your innocence?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the date of the defendant's program end date as 'December fifteenth, 2012' instead of 'December 5th, 2012'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'your program was ended' instead of 'your program ended'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master's degree in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of the defendant's suspicion in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the question of whether the defendant has any evidence to help their case in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the mention of the defendant's interaction with Wang Cai Yan in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of the defendant's messages being mostly after nine o'clock in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the mention of the defendant's suspicion in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the question of whether the defendant has any evidence to help their case in their translation.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我現在想不到有任何證據可以提供給法院來證明我的行為。我說過了，我和我同事間的簡訊互動是非常平常。我只是想要繼續學中文，並且增進我的中文能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the next court will be at four o’clock p.m., on July ninth, 2014. The main purpose of the court is to examine the witness’s statements. Plaintiff and defendant please show up on that day. If necessary both of you can have your lawyers. Do you understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong date and time
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of the witness examination procedure

我明白。
I understand.

I understand.
我明白

今天庭期到此結束。
Okay, so the procedure ends here.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'today' from the translation.
