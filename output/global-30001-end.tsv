請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any evidence you need to investigate or any witness to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena Cai Yan Wang, who is still working at the Bo Yuan cram school, as a witness. We want her to explain the reason why she texted those messages, and explain the relationship between she and the defendant.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical details of the content of the text messages and the background and purpose of their writing.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' before the object 'Cai Yan Wang', resulting in incorrect word order.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after the introductory phrase 'I would like to'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there any evidence you want the court to investing for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'investing' instead of 'investigate'.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
 I heard that the cram school has do some action because of their relationship. And there even someone was trying to persuade Cai Yan Wang to leave the cram school. Is it possible to verify the truth?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong verb

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there any evidence you want to court to investigate for you? The situation is your program was ended on December fifteenth, 2012. There is still no reason for you to keep texting messages with Cai Yan Wang for helping the homework. Especially, most of your messages are after nine o’clock, it is very suspicious. Do you have any evidence to prove your innocence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'your program was ended on December fifteenth, 2012' is incorrect. It should be 'your program ended on December fifteenth, 2012'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of '希望法庭為你調查的事證' as 'evidence you want the court to investigate for you' is incorrect. It should be 'evidence you hope the court to investigate for you'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant's master's degree and the date it ended, which is important context for the argument.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我現在想不到有任何證據可以提供給法院來證明我的行為。我說過了，我和我同事間的簡訊互動是非常平常。我只是想要繼續學中文，並且增進我的中文能力。

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the next court will be at four o’clock p.m., on July ninth, 2014. The main purpose of the court is to examine the witness’s statements. Plaintiff and defendant please show up on that day. If necessary both of you can have your lawyers. Do you understand?

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are going to discuss the adultery case. The plaintiff filed this case. The reason is that the plaintiff’s husband had the intimate messages with colleague in the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate massages in her husband’s phone. Moreover, her husband often made up reasons for additional working in the cram school, and sometimes in the in the night………The plaintiff found the content in the messages and the behavior between them is beyond co-worker’s relationship. Defendant, your wife doubts that you have adultery, what’s your plea?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific names of the plaintiff and defendant.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'in the cram school' in the wrong position in the sentence.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the information about the defendant's response to the accusation.

Not guilty, of course.
我無罪答辯阿當然
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparing procedure, the main course is to ask the defendant and his colleague about the intimate messages. The aim is to find out if they constitute the adultery. Do both party understand the procedure?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long is your marriage?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
Our marriage last four years, we don’t have child.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'been' in the sentence 'Our marriage has been last four years'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'last' instead of 'has lasted' in the sentence 'Our marriage last four years'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a period at the end of the sentence.
grammar and structure	agreement errors in number or gender	The user used the singular form 'child' instead of the plural form 'children' in the sentence 'We don’t have child'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry in Taiwan? Or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I acquainted with my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is also from Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'acquainted' before the subject 'I', which is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'acquainted' instead of 'met', which is not the appropriate word choice.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So I the past years, your husband’s job is teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be 'was' to match the past tense of the original text.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we know each other at the very first time, he is a teacher who teaching Portuguese. After we married, he still teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hour is not very regular. Sometimes, there….will….are 1or2 months between jobs. to make the income more regularly, he changes to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he seeks an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'When we know each other at the very first time' should be 'When we first got to know each other'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'After we married, he still teach Portuguese' should be 'After we got married, he still teaches Portuguese'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'Sometimes, there will are 1 or 2 months between jobs' should be 'Sometimes, there will be 1 or 2 months between jobs'.
omission or addition	omission of details	Omission of the word 'jobs' in the sentence 'Sometimes, there will be 1 or 2 months between jobs'.
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	Incorporating the word 'to' in the sentence 'to make the income more regularly' is unnecessary.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after the word 'regularly' in the sentence 'to make the income more regularly he changes to teach English'.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	Inserting the phrase 'he seeks an advanced degree' is not present in the original text.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
As you said, he want to seek a advanced degree. Is it mean he want to get the degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek a advanced degree' instead of 'further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he want to teach in Taiwan, he wants to get the English teaching degree. And he found a distance learning program on the internet which is from the California. This program enable him to not to go to the America and still can get the learning program from distance learning. And after he…complete this program, he can get the degree. His plan is after he get the degree from the program, he can teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what’s the relationship between the person he has the affair with
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleague in cram school. The cram school schedule a program which combine the Chinese teacher and foreigner teacher. And the woman is the Chinese teacher who partner with him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did know they are in the adultery?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'know' before the subject 'they' instead of after.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'adultery' instead of 'having an affair'.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So what did you find in his telephone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific information about what was found in the telephone.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, it appears a same number many times. So I am very curious about that, so I check his phone book. After I check her telephone. He sent the messages every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the person the subject is communicating with.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect, resulting in a confusing and unclear translation.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Even if he sent the messages every day. It’s normal, or if there any……………
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation at the end of the sentence

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If these are common messages, it’s ok with me. However, he is married, how could that woman sent the intimate messages. I had provide their messages I the court. I think they are in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了' as 'If these are common messages, it’s ok with me.' The correct translation is 'If it was just ordinary text messages, it would be fine.'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical context of the messages being provided to the court, which is mentioned in the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
I am going to show you a file……….there are some contents of the message. Please check. Are these your messages?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是這是我手機的簡訊
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (is) before the subject '這' (this), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
And now I will ask you some questions about the messages. The first one is in 9:30 pm, on 2012, Nonmember 31, from 0958932***. The content is “I really, my love.” What does it mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of the word 'miss'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect placement of words in the sentence
omission or addition	omission of details	missing the word 'miss' in the translation

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
喔那是從我同是那傳來的阿,我記得那天我休假了兩天,而他很擔心我發生什麼事了,這也就是為什麼他要傳簡訊給我,我同事是接受美國教育的,他是個很開放的人,這就是他講話的方式,他表達自己情感的方式,致於我們通常都稱對方…..
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	adding unnecessary information
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
As you said, the one who sent the message was educated in America, so she is very open mined or westernized. So the way she express herself is more open minded. So the term “My Love” do not mean anything, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'My Love' without considering its cultural and semantic implications.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然阿,對我們來講,這就是對於好朋友之間的稱呼阿……………..
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation does not capture this meaning.

那她前面那句呢？
What about the message before that?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的阿,他就是很擔心我阿,我們是課程上的搭檔,當我休假兩天的時候他是真的很想我阿
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我說的, 他很擔心我'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '課程' (course) is used instead of '工作' (work) in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the information about the speaker being away for two days, which is a critical detail in the original text.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that the woman sent these messages just because you didn’t go to work in these two days? Because without your help, she was very miss you. Is that all?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對阿,這就是整個簡訊的重點,所以簡訊內容根本就不是什麼了的是
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the details of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
So the second message is from in 11:55 pm, on 2013, January 13. And this is from the same sender. The content …………….  What does this message mean? Why did she sent this to you?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '手機' as 'sender' instead of 'phone'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '訊息內容' as 'content' instead of 'message content'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '中華民國' which means 'Republic of China'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '年' which means 'year'.

semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '你' which means 'you'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '給' which means 'to'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '這句話' which means 'this sentence'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '什麼意思' which means 'what does it mean'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '為什麼' which means 'why'.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他傳這封簡訊是教我怎麼用中文表達自己的情感
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他傳這封簡訊教我怎麼用中文表達自己的情感'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text 'to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment' is not accurately conveyed in the translation '教我怎麼用中文表達自己的情感' which means 'teach me how to express my emotions in Chinese'.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Do you mean that the sender sent this message just because she wants to help you with your assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太告訴你們的,我參加了一個碩士課程,在那個課程中,我必須完成三十個學分才能的到學位,所以當然我必須完成許多作業跟研究報告
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of assignments and exercises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '跟研究報告' (and research reports) at the end of the sentence instead of after '作業' (assignments).

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what’s your degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'master's' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user inverted the word order in the translation.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我所受的課程是英語教學課程,那課程包括一些英語教學還有文化,語言能力相關的一些課
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific courses that were related to culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So the degree you are going to get is about TESOL and about the culture communication, right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對阿,救我記憶所及,我記得有三個課程都跟文化溝通有關
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'at least' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'related' before the subject 'courses' instead of after.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '跟' which means 'with' instead of '關於' which means 'about'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what’s the assignment from culture communication?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這個課程作業會根據每個學生的不同有不一樣的作業,以我為例,我是一個想在台灣獲得英語教學碩士的人,在這個課程中我必須證明我自己的語言能力,而且我必須向這個課程證明我的中文能力,所以在這個課程中我所做的作業都跟中英翻譯有官
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'many' assignments in their translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context of the assignments being related to proving language competence and seeking a teaching position.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order in the sentence '在這個課程中我所做的作業都跟中英翻譯有官' is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '官' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'translation'.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Do you mean that the English degree you want to get ask you to prove your Chinese competence? So you have to complete the assignment about the culture communication, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of specific assignments and focused only on the culture communication assignment.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence structure should be 'Do you mean that the English degree you want to get asks you to prove your Chinese competence?'

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對阿當然,同時我也必須精進我的說跟寫
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So let’s go back, so do you mean that these are your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿當我看到這些中文句子的時候我還不知道我要怎麼把它翻成英文,我想你們應該知道這些句子對外國人來講是很難去記得的,我需要別人的幫助,所以我請我的搭檔協助我,我請他幫我翻譯這些句子,然後請他寄給我

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
As you said, you ask the colleague to help with your assignment, so she translated the sentences to English and sent these to you, right? So in other saying, the messages are the answers from the assignments?

That message was only the answer to my homework.
這些簡訊都只是我作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now we are going to show you the file one, the page 14-16, there are all the content of your messages. Please, check the content. Is that all the answer of your assignments which you ask your colleague to help you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the messages, such as the actual content and who sent them.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的這些簡訊內容全部都是為了協助我完成我的作業
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So according to your wife’s ……………what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific accusation made by the wife.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the ellipsis in the wrong position.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我覺得我太太想太多了,我知道他對於我養這個家有很多的疑問,我希望庭上可以了解,在我尋求我的碩士學位時,他從來都不曾幫助過我也不曾支持過我,他根本就不願意幫助我去完成我的學業,如果他有那麼易點院易幫助我的心的話,我今天就不用我同事幫我了,我覺得這一切都是因他而起

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, is there any unhappy thing between you both?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
一開始我們結婚的時候,我們的確有一段快樂的時光,但是問題是……我試著在台灣教葡萄牙語,但是我的授課時數真的一點都不夠,所以我的工作漸漸變成我們兩個之間最大的問題,我們為了這件事情爭吵不休,他不相信我,我為了這件是已經盡的最大的努力了,他真的不了解我有多麼挫折,而且我有多麼想要完成這件事情]

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So let’s go back to the master degree program. When did your master program start? Is it finished? Or you are in program now?

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春天開始的,他是一個兩年的課程,我必須在12月12號之前完成他,但是我並沒有完成這個課程,是因為我同時我還有兼職工作,我並沒有時間去完成這個課程需要的作業跟報告,就像我說的我老婆從來就沒有支持過我,我認為我在追求我的碩士學位期間我很孤單,我覺得很累也很挫折

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So what is the finished day of your last registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversed word order

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我這個註冊學期是2012年的秋天
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'last' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the year '2012' before the phrase '的秋天', which is incorrect in Chinese.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
According to your statement, the finished day of your program is 2012.Dec 5. So after that day, you should not have any statement after that day, right? But the messages between Wang and you is last 6 months after you finished your master degree program. Why?

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成我的碩士學位並不代表我不想要精進我的中文能力阿,就算我沒有完成我的碩士學位,我還是想要精進我的中文能力,所以我還是請我的同事協助我
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of studying on their own.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '阿' at the end of the sentence instead of after '中文能力'.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Do you mean that even you failed the master program, you still want to polish cjinese competence, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'polish' is not an accurate translation for '不斷學習'.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對阿,所以這就是我為什麼要請我同事幫我的原因
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'colleague' in the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So do you mean that your colleague is like you tutor?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation uses the word 'tutor' instead of 'family tutor', which changes the meaning.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是我的家教也是我的好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Do you pay?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有阿,但是我曾經說要付錢給他但他說不用
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
So if you didn’t pay her, why did she send you messages? Is she a diligent girl? Is that go beyond co-worker’s relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	changed the meaning of the original text

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我說的,他是我非常好的朋友,他用他所有的時間來幫助我,幫助我學習中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
So do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the subject and verb

Yes, I am still working there.
對我還在教書
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is Wang still teaching there?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
他也還在那教書阿,只是我們不是搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any further investigation? Or do you have to subpoena anyone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'witness' in the translation.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena Wang in the 伯元cram school in the next court as the witness. I want her to explain the function of the messages and the relationship between the defendant.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the messages and their background and purpose.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' after the object 'Wang', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'function' instead of 'relationship' to describe the messages.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard about that the cram school had take some actions to handle the relationship between them, And they had pursued the woman, Wang, to drop the job. Would the court check this?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate? The situation is that your master degree was finished in 2012, Dec 5. It is not the reason to explain the behavior between you and Wang. Particularly, your communication was ….at 9 pm. It was very strange. Do you have any evidence which can help you with your case?

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我不認為法庭可以為我找到什麼證據幫助我,就像我說的我跟我同事之間的溝通是非常正常的,我只是想要精進我的中文能力而且持續的學習

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the investigatory procedure for the adultery. The… the plaintiff, Yu-Huwa Chen, has press…press the case. The reason why he filed this case is because she think his…her husband have too… have a very… um… have a very intimate relationship with his crime…crime-school (cram school, 發音不對) co-worker.

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you been married with your husband? And did you have any child… did you have any kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	repetition of phrases	The user repeated the question 'did you have any child?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve been married for four years, and we have no children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
 Did you get married… did you got married in Taiwan? Or in the foreign country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, when he first arrived Taiwan, he wanted to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is also from Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'first' after the verb 'arrived', instead of before.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '認識' as 'met' instead of 'know'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '葡萄牙文', which means 'Portuguese'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So then in the past few years, is what he did for living? …….teach, teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'living' is used instead of 'work', which changes the meaning.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he keep doing that, he kept doing that……teaching Portuguese. But the Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hour is not very stable. Sometimes the period between jobs will be one or two months. So…after that, he want to have a regular income, so he started to teach… so he started to teach English……he wanted to start teach English. But the English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'doing that' instead of 'teaching'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wants to… he wants… he wants an advanced degree? Is that he… is that means… is that mean he tried to study a degree in Taiwan
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of '進修' as 'study a degree' instead of 'advanced degree'

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he needed is something related to English teaching. He find a distance learning program on the net. So he don’t… he didn’t have to go to American, America to learn the thing. He can get this degree through distance online learning. So after all the program subject he had learn, he can get his degree. His plan was that through this American degree that he can found a job in Taiwan to teach English.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So, what is the relationship between your husband and this co-worker he’s having affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-worker in the cram school. The cram school had the teaching style that the Chinese teacher will partner with a foreign teacher, and that co-worker was… is Chinese teacher.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
So how did you know about this affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'this' which is important for the context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'this' at the end of the sentence instead of before the verb 'know'.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
 In the phone book, is there anything unusual?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
His record, there’s a number keep showing… kept showing up. So I got curious, so I checked his messages. After that, that’s when I found that he almost have these text messages with this girl, co-worker, everyday.

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
It’s just the message, is that serious? Is there improper in these messages?
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the polite tone of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it’s just a normal message, then nothing will matter. But he’s a married man! How could he let the other sent these so intimate message… intimate sentence to him? I had provided some messages in my evidence to the court. I think it’s all in there.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '讓對方發一些很親密的字句' as 'let the other sent these so intimate message… intimate sentence to him', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages as evidence to the court, which is important context in the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see the record p.13. Here are several messages from your cellphone, please look at it, defendant. Is this from your smartphone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對，這是從我手機裡拿出來的簡訊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '簡訊' is translated as '簡訊' instead of 'message'.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I’m going to focus on these messages and have several questions for you. The first message is… was dated back to 2011, Nov. 31st, in the… 9:15 in the evening, and it’s from 0958932xxx. (後面翻成中文了囧)
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the content of the message.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user mistranslated the content of the message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是一個我的同事傳給我的。我記得那個時候我請了兩天假。她有點擔心。這就是為什麼他要傳這封簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，她的思想非常開放。那就是她講話和表達感情的方式。那至於”我的愛”，我們就是這麼稱呼所在意的人。

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean this message sender… because she was… was in the United State, so she’s more westernized? So he…so her way to show her express… to express his emotions is more… open? So, “my love” didn’t mean anything, is that right?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然沒有啊。這就只是兩個感情很好的朋友，或者是很關心彼此的朋友之間的表達方式阿。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation does not capture this meaning.

那她前面那句呢？
So the former sentence she said?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，她很擔心我，我們是工作上的夥伴。我請假兩天，她當然會想我啊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們是工作上的夥伴' instead of '我們是夥伴工作上的'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'naturally missed me' as '當然會想我啊' does not accurately convey the meaning. '想我' means 'think of me' rather than 'miss me'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean, she sent these messages just because you took two days off? Without your help in the class, she missed you a lot, is that so?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對，最主要就是那個概念，簡訊內容並不重要。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message, is sent in 2012, Jan. 13th, and is in evening 11:15…11:55, and is from the same person. (後面又翻成中文了orz) Can you tell me what these means? Why would she say something like this?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the content of the message.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user did not accurately translate the greeting and the cultural context.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這封簡訊給我，主要是為了表示…主要是為了表達……怎麼用中文的方式表達。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'message' is translated as '簡訊' which means 'text message' instead of 'message'.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you these messages to help you on your assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太曾經跟庭上所講過，我正在學習一個美國學位…一個碩士學位。在這個學程裡面，我被要求要完成三十個
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of credits, assignments, and exercises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you just explain what exactly you’re study for you master program? For you master degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'are' in the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'for' in the wrong position in the sentence.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位是英語教學。在這個學位裡面，主要是教有關英語教學，但是也會參雜著有關英語能力的學習，以及文化。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation uses the word '能力' (ability) instead of '語言能力' (language competence).

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you mean you’re getting a TESOL degree, but that can include some English competence, is that right? ……some course about the culture, not English competence.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the meaning of 'English competence'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of 'TESOL degree'

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得至少有三門課是有關於文化和溝通。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'courses' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'three'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '門' which means 'doors' instead of 'courses'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
In these culture and communication courses, what assignments did you have?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'did' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'did' before the subject 'you' instead of after.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
對每個學生來說，文化與溝通功課可能…對每個學生來說，都不一樣啊。就以我自己來舉例，我是一個在台灣試圖教…取得英語教學證明的外國人。為了證明我的能力，我必須證明我的中文能力。所以我有很多中英互翻譯的作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation uses incorrect words that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean because you wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so this degree ask you to prove your ability to use… Chinese? So you have to finished the assignment, and this assignment included sentence translation, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'use' instead of 'speak'

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對。而且我還被要求要加強我的口說和寫作能力。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '而且我還被要求要' which is not present in the original text.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So back to the former sentence… the former line, you said this is your assignment, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得這個句子。當我拿到這個中文句子的時候，我不知道怎麼把他翻成英文。你知道，有些中國字對外國人來說是很難認的。我需要一些幫助，所以我請我同事幫忙。我請她幫我翻譯這個句子，然後傳簡訊給我…傳答案給我
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by the colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not in the correct order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'translate' instead of 'interpret' when referring to the colleague's assistance.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean because you asked her how the sentence was said in…you send her the sentence in Chinese, and she translated it into English for you, and send you the answer, is that right? So this message is an answer for your assignment?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
And now please see the p.14 to 16 in the record. Please see the content. Are these all because you ask for help to your assignment, so the other person sent these to you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the content on pages 14 to 16.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the necessary context for the content on pages 14 to 16.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，這些簡訊全都是為了我的作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So back to the point that you wife said you have an affair with your co-worker, Tsai-yian Wang, what’s your saying?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'have' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'back' in the wrong position in the sentence.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的事對這件事想太多了。我知道她對於支撐這個家的能力並不是非常滿意。但我希望法院…我希望庭上知道，在我的學習過程中，她從來沒有支持過我。她根本就不願意幫我完成我的學位。如果她能多支持我一點的話，我就不用向我同事求助了。我覺得她才是這整起誤會需要被…最需要…最主要負責的人。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
So according to you, I think…it seems that there are some friction… friction… fraction between you and your wife
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'fraction' is used instead of 'friction', resulting in a mismatched meaning.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們剛結婚的時候，確實是一段好時光。但工作是我…是一個很大的問題。我想在台灣教葡萄牙文，但沒辦有有固定的授課時數，所以我的工作就變成了我們兩個之間的問題。我們為了這件事不知道已經吵了幾次架了。她不相信我已經盡了我最大的努力。她完全沒有辦法理解我所遇到的挫折以及我所遇到的問題。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
OK. Back to the master degree, the program you just mentioned. Can you tell me when your program begin? Is it end?

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2010年的春天開始課程。那是個兩年的課程。我應該要在……2012年的12月之前完成課程。但是我並沒有如期完成，因為我…因為我一直在工作，所以我沒有辦法完成我的作業。就像我所說的，我的太太不怎麼支持我。我覺得我只有一個人在為學位奮鬥。我太累而且也太挫折了。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean you… you used to be a two-year program, and you failed to finish it. Why was that?

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法上完所有必需…要求的課程。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
 So your last registration semester, when did it end?

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個註冊的學期是…2012的秋季班。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So if what you said was true… everything you said is true, your last course should be end at 2012, Nov. 15th. After that, you should not have any assignment, is that right? But your assignment text between you and your co-worker, kept… continued six months after your courses ended, how is that so?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成那個課程，並不代表我不想增進我的中文能力…我的語言能力呀。雖然我沒有完成指定課程，但我還是想增進我的中文能力，所以我決定自修。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even you failed to finish that master degree program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為什麼我請我同事幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So this co-worker is playing a role that can call…can be called your…mentor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'mentor' does not accurately convey the meaning of '家教' (tutor).

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是個家教，她還是個真誠的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有。我曾經提供過這個想法，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經提供過這個想法，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
So, if you didn’t pay her, then why would she still send these message at the hour, at this late hour that she supposed to be rest, to be sleeped, to you? Is that beyond the co-worker obligation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我說的阿，她是一個非常真誠、非常支持的朋友。她利用她自己的私人時間來幫助我學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '就像我說的，她是一個非常真誠、非常支持的朋友。'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of using her own time to help the speaker learn Chinese.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teaching English at that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我還在那裏工作。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
And this co-worker, Tsai-yian Wang, still work here?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the name of the co-worker, Tsai-yian Wang.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
對，她還在那裏教書，但我們現在不是搭檔。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們現在不是搭檔' instead of '但我們不是搭檔現在'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Is there any person or investi…investi… evidence that the prosecutor want to do a further investigation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope the court can call this Tsai-yian Wang as the witness to the court. Let her explain the true message behind these texts and why… and why she write…she wrote these messages to him.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about the relationship between the witness and the defendant, as well as the background and purpose of the text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'Let her explain the true message behind these texts and why she wrote these messages to him.'

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had some action because of their relationship because of…because both of them. And they even try to persuade Tsai-yian Wang to leave the work. Is it possible to confirm this information to…to that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide enough context for the action taken by the cram school.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not use proper punctuation in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the wrong word for 'confirm'.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there anything you want to court to do the further investigation for you? Now here’s the thing, your degree, your program has already end at 20…2012, Dec. There is really no reason for you to say that your message is because she’s helping you to do your assignment. Especially your message usually were sent after 9 pm. And this is something normal people won’t… wouldn’t do. Do you have any evidence can help this case.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'want' instead of 'hope'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting 'further investigation' as 'help this case'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我覺得庭上沒有甚麼可以為我調查的證據了。就像我說的，我和我同事之間的關係非常簡單，只想增進我的語文能力，學習中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

我明白。
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
我明白。

今天庭期到此結束。
So today’s court is adjourned.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Today's court adjourned.'

今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are her for the preparation procedure for adultery. The plaintiff sued up for the case. It is because her husband John Anderston is in a relation with a teacher from his colleague. The plaintiff found some intimate messages from her husband’s phone. Plus, her husband, the defendant, usually have some excuses to stay in the cram school with his colleague王彩燕, and sometimes has some tele-conferencing. What the plaintiff has collected of the information are actually beyond the colleagues’ relationship. As a result, the plaintiff sued up. Defendant, your wife thinks you have affairs with you colleague. What’s your plead?

Not guilty, of course.
當然沒有阿
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not convey the meaning of 'Not guilty' accurately.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’ preparatory procedure, we are here for asking the messages between the defendant and his colleague. The purpose is to understand the defendant and his colleague really have intimate messages and even adultery. Do both parties of you fully understand your rights?

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'intimate messages' instead of 'communication details'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting legal terms	translating '通姦罪' as 'adultery' instead of 'adultery crime'

我明白
I understand

I understand.
我明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long do you marry your husband. Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'Plaintiff' is not an appropriate translation for '告訴人'. It should be 'complainant' or 'plaintiff'.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for 4 years, and we have no kids.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker's husband.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'have' instead of 'has' to agree with the singular subject 'husband'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry you husband in Taiwan or foreign countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you and your husband marry in Taiwan or in a foreign country?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that they themselves are also from Taiwan.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past a few years, did he only work for teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he is a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued his teaching. However, in Taiwan, Portuguese is not a famous English language, which is like English, so his teaching hours is not stable. Sometimes he will have even a period between jobs about two months. Afterwards, in order to make stable income, he started to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English. As a result, he seeks an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean he want to study a program in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '進修' as 'seeking an advanced degree'

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he has to have a degree of English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California on the internet. So he don’t have to go to school but can have an on-line learning at home. After he finished all he course, he can got the master degree. His plan is that if he got the master degree in Taiwan, then he can also teach English. So what is the relationship between him and the person he has affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'So he don’t have to go to school but can have an on-line learning at home.' The correct word order should be 'So he doesn't have to go to school but can have online learning at home.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作' as 'His plan is that if he got the master degree in Taiwan, then he can also teach English.' The correct translation should be 'His plan is that with this American degree, he can find a job as an English teacher in Taiwan.'

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
They are colleagues of cram school.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the relationship between the two individuals.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
The cram school plans a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher working together for a program, and the woman is his partner.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the woman being a Chinese teacher.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have some affairs?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'some' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'some' at the end of the sentence instead of before the noun 'affairs'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I just noticed that my husband usually stayed at cram school for over work. I have asked him for many times. It is just a cram school. How could he work so much? He told me because he needs to partner with the Chinese teacher, so they need a lot of time to communicate and discuss. At first, I really didn’t think too much. But later I found he usually got some phone calls after he was home. And he usually picked up his phone in the study room rather with me. It seems like he wants to hide something, so I check his phone book.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the husband stays at the cram school for overtime work.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context that the husband receives phone calls and hides them from the speaker.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'usually' before the verb 'picked up', which is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not use any punctuation to separate the sentences.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Do you find anything weird in his phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'unusual' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'weird' and 'find' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone records, I found there is a number showing up for many times, Because I am curious about that, I check his test messages, too. After I checked his text messages, I found they text each other almost every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific content of the text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Just texting, it is not that serious. Is the content not appropriate?
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural norms of greetings and etiquette in the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If that is just a common message, it’s okay. But he has got married, how could he text the kind of messages with other woman? I have provided some messages to the court. I think they are in the files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please show the evidence record, number 13. Here are some text messages. Defendant, please check it. Are these from your phone’s text messages?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機裡面的簡訊內容

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I have a few questions about these messages. The first message is from 0958-932-XXX at 9:50 PM on December 31th, 2012, is that right? The content shows “I really miss you, my love.” What did it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那只是我同事傳給我的訊息，我記得那時候我請了兩天假，她只是太擔心了而已，這大概就是她為什麼會傳這樣的簡訊給我的原因，我同事是在美國受教育的，所以她比較開放一點，這就是她平常的說話方式跟表達方式，至於所提到的「我的愛」，只是我們平常用來稱呼我們比較親密在乎的人而已
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	adding unnecessary information
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean the sender is that westernized because she stayed in United State for many years and the way she expresses herself is quietly open as well. So “my love”, this word means nothing. Is that right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the meaning of '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering the cultural context.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿，這在好朋友之間是很常見的，而且我們又是這麼熟的朋友
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural meaning of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
What about the sentence she just mentioned?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就如同我所說的，她只是擔心我，因為我們是工作上的同事阿，所以我沒去上班幾天，她想我也是滿正常的
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of being partners at work.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '阿' (a particle used in Mandarin Chinese) at the end of the sentence, which is incorrect in English.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean that she sent this message to you just because you are not for work for two days. Because without your assistance, so she missed you a lot. That’s all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對阿就是這樣，簡訊內容根本沒有什麼問題啊
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the message, which is 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message is from the same number at23:55 PM on January 13th in 2013. The content of the message is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this message mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這封簡訊的目的只是要問我在中文裡面要怎麼表達這個句子的意思
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the purpose of the message

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean she sent this message to you just to help you finish your homework? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original meaning

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
在我太太提告之前，我正準備要完成我的碩士學位，在這課程當中，我必須修滿30個學分才能結業，所以很自然地我當然必須完成一些練習還有作業阿
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what’s your master degree about?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'first' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user inverted the word order in the translation.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我學的是英語教學，在這課程當中，大部分跟英語教學有關，但有些也跟文化還有語言能力有關
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So what you got your master degree is a TESOL, and there are also some culture programs, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'in' before 'a TESOL'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'is' before 'a TESOL' instead of after.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是阿，我記得當中至少有三門課程是跟文化有關係的
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of courses being related to communication.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '至少有三門課程' (at least three courses) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '我記得' (I remember).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '當中' (among) instead of '至少' (at least), which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So this kind of culture program… what kind of homework will it has?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
關於文化與溝通這方面，可能會因為不同學生而因人而異，拿我自己為例子，我是打算在台灣尋求英語教學資格，為了證明跟表達我自己能力，我必須展現出我對中文的掌握能力，因此在我的作業當中有很多中英互相翻譯的作業

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misinterpreting the cultural context

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean you want to teach English in Taiwan so that the program ask you to prove the language competence of Chinese, is that right? So you have to finish some homework, and the homework is about sentence translating. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對阿就是這樣，而且我也同時被要求要精進我自己的聽跟口說能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of writing skills.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
OK that’s go back to what we just mentioned. You mean that this is your homework right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is this your homework?'

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿，我還記得那個句子，當我拿到這個中文句子時，我實在不知道怎麼去翻譯，你知道有些中文的字對外國人來說是非常難去理解的，我需要一些協助所以我就請我的同事幫忙，我請她幫我翻譯並把句子傳給我
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added 'and sent me the answer'

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You meant that you ask your colleague to tell you what’s the meaning, and she translates into English form and send it to you? In other words, the message is just the content of your homework?

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，這封訊息真的只是我作業的答案
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the homework assignment.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
That’s take the documentary, the file from page 14 to page 16. Here are some contents of the messages. Please check these messages. Are these all out of your homework so you seek for your colleague’s help and she sent them back to you?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，所有的簡訊內容都只是幫助完成我的作業
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the details of the messages being for the purpose of completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So what’s your explain about your wife charged you and your colleague王彩燕have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'charged' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'charged' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'wife', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'explain' instead of 'explanation', which is incorrect in this context.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了，我知道她覺得我能力不足以養整個家，我希望庭上了解，在我開始修課之後的所有期間，她從未提供我任何協助，她根本沒有想要幫助我完成學位的意思，如果她願意幫助我的話，我根本不需要向我的同事求助，我覺得她應該為這些所有誤會道歉
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your words, it seems like you and your wife have some misunderstanding and even unhappy?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '相處不愉快' as 'misunderstanding and even unhappy' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們剛結婚時，一開始我們確實過得很開心，但問題出在我的工作，我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但沒有辦法有穩定的教學時數，所以我的工作變成我們之間的問題、導火線，我們為這件事情吵了很多次，她不肯相信我已經盡全力了，我也沒有辦法讓她了解我所面臨的困境和無力
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok let’s go back to your master degree you just mentioned. When did you start your master degree? Did it end already?

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2010年的春季開始上課的，我必須要在12月22日完成這個課程，我並沒有完成我的學業，因為我同時在打工，而且沒有時間做我的作業，
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted information about the program being a two-year program
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted information about feeling tired and frustrated
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrectly translated 'should have finished' as '必須要在12月22日完成'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrectly placed the time phrase '在2010年的春季' after '開始上課的'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation at the end of the sentence '我並沒有完成我的學業，因為我同時在打工，而且沒有時間做我的作業'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean the term of this program is two years long, but you didn’t finish it. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法修完所有的課程
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'requirement' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when did you finish the course?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一次註冊的時間點是2012年的秋季
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'semester' in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you just mentioned, you course ended on December 5th in 2012, which means you won’t have any homework afterwards. Is that right? But you and your colleague still have some inappropriate messages after you finish your course for six months. What does that mean?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
即使我沒有繼續修課了不代表我沒有繼續增進我語言能力的意思，為了增進我的中文能力，我只能夠靠自己繼續練習下去
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean even you didn’t finish the program you still want to sharpen your Chinese skills?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫忙
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague is just like your tutor, tight?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'tight' does not accurately convey the meaning of '家教' (tutor).

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，她也是我的真心朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經想過但是被她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經想過但是被她拒絕了，沒有。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her anything, why did she send these messages to you so late? Was that too much for a colleague doing this for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這也是為什麼我說她是一個…很挺我的朋友阿，她用她自己的個人時間來幫助我學習中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是一個很挺我的朋友'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'supportive' which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The translation leaves out the context of the friend helping the user learn Chinese, which is important in understanding the relationship between the two.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still teaching in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'English' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那裡上班
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the word '還' (still) which is not present in the original text.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
What about your colleague, 彩燕王? Is she still working there?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the name of the colleague, 彩燕王, in the translation.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她還在那邊工作，但我們已經沒有再一起搭檔了
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any further questions or any evidence that you want to ask?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of witnesses or evidence.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena on 彩雲王, who works for the cram school, and come here to get some information. I would like to understand the background of these text messages between the defendant and his colleague.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the name of the colleague, 彩燕王, and only mentioned 彩雲王.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention the role of 彩燕王 as a witness.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention the purpose of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Do you want the court to help you investigate?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of what evidence the court should investigate.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had some actions against their affairs. And even the cram school officers tried to ask 彩燕王 to leave the job. Can the court check this from the cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you? Your work has already ended at December 5th 2012, you have no excuses to text messages with 彩燕王 for finishing assignments. Especially your text interactions are at night after 9 o’clock. That’s weird. Do you have any evidence that can help you with the case?

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到任何庭上可以代替我去調查的證據，就如同我所說，我同事跟我之間的傳訊內容就真的這麼單純而已，我只是希望她能過增進我的中文能力，然後幫助我繼續學習中文下去

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The plantiff, Yu-Hua Chen filed for this case mainly because her husband John Anderson has a very intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school…from a cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cell phone. And…in addition, the defendant often say that…he is going to work extra hours or do tele-conferencing with his colleague, Tsai-Yian Wang. The messages which the plaintiff found…was not only just colleague relationship. As a result, she filed for the case. Defendant, your wife filed an adultery case against you. What’s your plea?

Not guilty, of course.
當然是無罪。

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
Today this procedure…we’re going to confirm the details of the messages of the defendant and his colleague. We would like to make sure that if they really committed adultery and constitute the crime of adultery. Do both of you understand the procedure?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you and your husband been married? Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married?' instead of 'How long have you and your husband been married?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years. We don’t have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you and your husband get married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
My husband and I met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and taught Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that they met in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the husband's main purpose was to teach Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past few years, is his job teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued teaching Portuguese. However, in Taiwan Portuguese is not that popular, so his teaching hours was not…teaching hours were not that stable. Sometimes he has periods between jobs for like…one or two months. After that, in order to get more stable income, he decided to start teaching English. However, his mother tongue is not English…he decided to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You said that he was going to seek for an advanced degree, do you mean that he’s going to study a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek for an advanced degree' instead of 'study for an advanced degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he hoped that he could teach English, he had to get a degree of teaching…English teaching. He found a distance learning program on the internet which is provided by California. In this case, he didn’t have to go to the United States. He only had to do online learning. After he got all the credits, he can get…master degree. His plan is that after he got this English teaching degree, he can teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what is his relationship with this person he has an affair with?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues…in cram school…in the cram school he works for. The plan of the cram school is that foreign teacher partner with Chinese teacher, and that woman is his partner.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know that they committed…he committed adultery?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'adultery' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'committed' before the noun 'adultery', which is incorrect in English.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
What did you see in his cell phone then? Something unusual…anything unusual?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I often see the same number in his calling record, so I was quite curious and looked at his messages…checked his messages. After I checked his cell phones, I found that he messaged with this…with a woman every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
What is big about sending messages? Is the content not appropriate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
 If it’s something very usual, I won’t really care, but he’s a married man, how can he let the other one send messages which is a bit…vague? In the past, I have already provided some contents of the messages. They should be in the documents.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation of '很親密的字句' as 'vague' does not accurately convey the intended meaning. '很親密的字句' means 'intimate words or phrases', not 'vague'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation omits the critical context of the user providing the messages to the court, which is important for understanding the situation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please look at page 13 of the document. Here are some contents…here of the contents of the messages. Defendant, please take a look. Is these…are these the messages in your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，是我簡訊的內容。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the cell phone in their translation.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
So now I’m going to focus on the content of the messages…I’ll ask you some questions. The message is send by the phone number 0958-932*** in November 31st, 2012 at 9:50 PM. The content is “我非常想念你,”What does this mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
就是我同事傳的啊。我記得那個時候我請了兩天假，她有點擔心。那就是為什…所以她才傳這樣的簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，所以很開明…開放，那就是她講話的方式。就是…「my love」這樣的詞就只是我們叫我們關心的人的方式。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that this woman stayed abroad, so her thoughts are more westernized? And the way her…she expressed her feelings is more…open-minded? So the phrase “my love” doesn’t really mean anything, right?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對啊，那是好朋友之間，或是很關心彼此的朋友表達的方式…稱呼彼此的方式。
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural context and significance of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我就說了，她…她很關心我，我們是工作上的好夥伴。當我請假兩天，他很自然地就會想念我啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
 You mean that the woman sent you this message just because you took two days off? Because you didn’t…you weren’t there to help her in class, she missed you? Is that right?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，內容就是這樣子，根本沒什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in the translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
So let’s look at the second message which is sent at 11:55 PM, January 13th, 2013 by the same person. 內容是我想要你在我身邊，我們什麼時候可以在一起？What does this mean? Why do you have that sentence in your cell phone?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I want you by my side' as '我想要你在我身邊' is accurate. However, the translation of 'when can we be truly together?' as '我們什麼時候可以在一起？' is not accurate. The original text implies a desire for a deeper level of connection or commitment, while the translation simply asks when they can be together. The word 'truly' is missing in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫那句話是想告訴我一句中文該怎麼說。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她寫那句話是想告訴我怎麼在我的作業中表達一句中文。'

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you this message because she was helping you finishing your homework. What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of the original text

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我妻子提到的，我現在正在修碩士課程。在那個學位中，我要修完三十個學分才能拿到學位。那我當然就要…完成一些練習、作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you please explain which program you are studying?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the assistant's program of study.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士課程是英語教學。這個課程主要就是英語教學，然後還會有一些文化語言…文化方面的東西還有語言能力等等。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you’re studying for the TESOL program, so there are some cultural lessons in that program, is that true? Is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得至少有三門課是跟文化與溝通有關的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of courses in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'related' before the subject 'courses' in their translation.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what kind of assignments do you have from these cultural communication course?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing question mark at the end of the sentence

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
對每個學生來說，這堂課的作業都不太一樣。我以我自己來說的話，我是在台灣然後想要成為一位英文老師。為了要拿到這個學位、表示我有能力，我也要證明說我的中文是很好的。所以很多我作業的內容都是中英翻譯的句子。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '的話' after '以我自己来说'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我以我自己来说的话'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	translated '課的作業' as 'this course's assignments' instead of 'the assignments for this course'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	did not translate 'culture and communication courses'

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Do you mean that you plan to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove that you have sufficient Chinese competence, is that right? So you have to finish some assignments in class, and these assignments are about translating sentences…between Chinese and English, right?

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對啊，我也被要求就是要增進我的口語表達和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s go back to the previous sentence. You said that they’re your assignments, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對啊，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這些…就是中文的句子的時候，我不知道英文怎麼講。你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說實在是太難了。我需要一些幫忙，所以請我的同事幫我。我請她翻譯一下那個句子，然後傳簡訊給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of what the Chinese sentences were and what the user asked their colleague to translate.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '就是中文的句子' in the wrong position in the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '對外國人來說' in the wrong position in the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我需要一些幫忙' in the wrong position in the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '所以請我的同事幫我' in the wrong position in the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我請她翻譯一下那個句子' in the wrong position in the sentence.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you said that you didn’t know the meaning of that sentence, so you ask your colleague to send you the translation in English by message, is that right? So the content of the message is the answer of your assignment, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text by not including the specific sentence that the speaker didn't understand.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user made a word order error by placing the verb 'ask' before the subject 'you' in the second sentence.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那個就是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
So how about…let’s look at the content of the messages on page 14 to 16 on the document. Please check the content. Is these messages sent by your colleague because you need help doing your assignment?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，所有的內容都是我要做作業所以傳的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the details of the purpose of completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So what do you want to say to your wife saying that you committed adultery with your colleague, Tsai-Yan Wang.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the part about explaining the situation.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我覺得她真的想太多了，關於這件事情。我知道她對我…對我照顧家庭的狀況不滿意。我想要讓法院知道的是，從我說我想要修這個學位開始，她就沒有提供任何的支持。她根本就不想要幫助我完成學位。如果她沒有這麼…如果她支持我的話，我就不會去尋求我同事的幫助。我覺得會產生這些誤會都是她的問題。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your words, the relationship between you two is a bit unpleasant, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛開始結婚的時候，確實相處得還不錯。但是問題就是…但是問題就是我的工作。我試著要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是授課時數就是不夠。然後我們兩個的關係就是因為我的工作變得不太好。我們為了這件事情…常常為了這件事情爭吵。她不相信我已經盡我所能了。我沒有辦法讓他了解我的…有多沮喪然後遇到的困難是什麼。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
OK, let’s go back to the master degree you were talking about. When did you start studying for your master degree. When did it end? Did you get the degree already?…Have you got the degree already?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing question mark at the end of the question.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation of '拿到學位了嗎？' as 'Have you got the degree already?' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be translated as 'Did you receive the degree?' or 'Have you obtained the degree?'

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我本來是在2010年的春天開始的…一開始。那是兩年的課程。我本來是應該是在2012年的12月完成這個學位。我之所以沒有準時拿到是因為我要工作…然後沒有辦法有時間去寫我的作業。就像我剛剛說的，我的老婆一直都沒有很支持我。我覺得我根本就是一個人在追求這個學位，我覺得很累很沮喪。

You said that this was a two-year program, and you didn’t finish it. Why is that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法完成所有的課程…修完所有的課程。

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When did the semester you last registered ended?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
恩…是在2012月四月。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'fall' which is a critical detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the year '2012' before the month '四月', which is incorrect in Chinese. The correct word order should be '四月2012'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So…as you said, according to your saying, the course ended on December 5th, 2012. After that…you won’t have…you didn’t really have assignments, right? But the messages between you and colleague continued until…continued for another six months. Why is that?

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我或許沒有想要把那個課程修完，但不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。就算我沒有修完那個學位，我還是想要增進我的中文能力，所以我開始自學。

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even though you haven’t finished your English, you still want to let your Chinese become more fluent, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，所以為什麼我請我同事幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So this colleague is somehow like…a tutor of yours, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague being a tutor.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不是只是一個家教而已，而且還是一個真正的好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我曾經要付錢給她' instead of '我曾經要付錢給她'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
 If you didn’t pay her, why does she send messages in the middle of the night with such effort? Is that beyond colleague…relationships between colleagues?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我說這個朋友很支持我啊。她用她自己的時間幫助我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這個朋友很支持我啊' instead of '我說這個朋友很支持我啊'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English at that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order of the sentence.

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我還在那裡工作。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is this woman, Tsai-Yan Wang your colleague, still working there?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the woman's name, Tsai-Yan Wang.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
對啊，她還在那裡工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是搭擋了' instead of '但已經不是搭擋了我們'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you want to investigate any further evidence?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of witnesses or evidence that may need to be summoned or investigated further.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena Wang…Tsai-Yan Wang, the colleague of the defendant, who works at Bo-Yuan Cram School. I hope that she can explain her relationship with the defendant and in what situation…under what circumstances are these messages sent.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Defendant, do you…what other evidences do you want us to investigate?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff as the subject of the question.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Defendant' after the verb 'do' instead of before it.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has taken some action concerning the relationship between them. And the cram school even asked the woman, Tsai-Yan Wang, to leave her job. Is it possible for…to check with the cram school about this matter?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Now, defendant, do you want to ask the court to investigate any evidence for you? The situation is…you have already completed…the courses have already been completed on December 5th, 2012. There…it is not acceptable that doing assignment is an excuse for Tsai-Yan Wang sending messages to you. Especially the time you send messages is always after 9 PM, that is quite doubtful. Do you have evidence which can help you with your case?

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到任何法庭可以為我調查的證據。就像我說的，我們傳簡訊的原因非常簡單，我只是想要增進我的語言能力，然後繼續學中文。

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So…the next court will be set at 4:30 PM, June 9th, 2014. We will inquire the witnesses. Plaintiff, defendant, both of you please come to the court. If it is necessary, you can both have lawyers, is that OK?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the year in the translation.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparation procedure. The plaintiff had filed the case mainly because her husband John Anderston had intimate relationship with his co worker and the plaintiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cell phone. Her husband always stay late at the cram school or tele-conferencing with his co worker at midnight. The behavior had already beyond co worker relationship .So she filed the case. Defendant, your wife suspect you of violating the crime law of adultery. What is your plea?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff's name, Chen Yuhua.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the fact that the plaintiff found the messages in her husband's cell phone.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention the co-worker's name, Wang Caiyan.

omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not include the fact that the defendant's wife is filing a case against him.

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'Not guilty' as '無罪答辯', which means 'pleading not guilty' instead of simply 'not guilty'.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparation procedure, we are going to ask questions about the relationship between the defendant and the co worker. The purpose is to find out whether the defendant has violated the criminal crime which is adultery and……..do the both parties understand?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long has you been married with your husband? Do you have a child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married with your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'has' should be 'have' to agree with the subject 'you'.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married ofr 4 years and we don’t have a child.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the possessive pronoun 'my' before 'husband'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the plural form 'we' with the singular verb 'don't'. It should be 'we don't'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
So Did you married your husband in Taiwan or at other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We meet ,…I met mu husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan because he wanted to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past years, his job is a Portuguese teacher, isn’t he?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense to match the context of the sentence.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a language in Taiwan that many people want to learn so his teacher hour is not stable. Sometimes he will have a period between jobs and the period may aim up to one or two months. So… hu… he started to teach English because he wants to have a more stable income. However, his mother tongue is not English so he decided to seek an advanced degree class for English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that he would like to seek an advanced degree, do you mean that he want a degree n Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advanced degree' instead of 'further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No , because he wanted to teach English , so what ..the degree he need is TESOL which means teaching English for speakers of other language .he found a distance teaching program in America …..in California, America on the internet. So he could finish the program by online learning,,, without …. He didn’t have to fly to America. After he finished the program, he could get a master degree. His plan was to … to get a degree by.. by finish finish …the program.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what is the relationship between the husband and the co- worker.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are classmates in the cram school.The cram school provide teachers both Chinese teachers and foreign teachers. And the woman is a partner with my husband in the cram school.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the woman is the user's husband's classmate.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'with my husband' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'partner'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '同事' as 'classmates' instead of 'colleagues'.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
Hw do you know they have intimate relationship?

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything unusual in this cell phone.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I saw one number appeared form time to time. I was curious about that so I checked his text messages too. After I checked that I found he almost has text messages with that woman every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '查' as 'checked' instead of 'looked up', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of '通訊紀錄' (communication records) in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'I saw' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'so' which disrupts the natural word order.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Though they are text messages… that are fine right? Or the content is not appropriate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it is just a normal message, that will be fine. But he is a married man. How could he let a woman send intimate messages to him? I had provided some messages content that they should be in the file.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please check investigatory file 1 page13In this file, here are some messages record, defendant, please checkArte these same messages with those messages in your phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對這是我手機裡的簡訊
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '對' which is not present in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I am going to ask some questions about those messages.The first text message was send on 9:50 in the evening on 11/31,2012. Form a number which is 0958-932===. The content is 我非常的想你 請你解釋這是什麼意思

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這次我一個同事發的 我記的那天 我休了兩天假 她是很擔心吧 所以她才會那封寄簡訊給我 我同事在美國受教育 她很開放 那是他講話表現 至於我的愛 那就是我們對我們關心的人的稱呼

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean the person who sends this message had stayed in the US so she is westernialized? And she is open-minded in expressing herself her emotions. So these words “my love did not mean a lot, isn’t it?”

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
這在好朋友之間的使用很正常
cultural transformation	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural meaning of the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous sentence she type?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'type' in the translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的 他很關心我 我們是公事上的夥伴 當我休了兩天假的後 他很自然就想我拉
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我說的，她很關心我。'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the translation. The correct verb form should be '想' instead of '想拉'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word choice in the translation is incorrect. The correct word for 'partners' should be '夥伴' instead of '公事上的夥伴'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean she send this message to you just because you were  you took two days off? Because without your corporation or assistance, she missed you? is that all?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對這就是簡訊就沒什麼 內容很正常
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in their translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was send to you at 11:55 in the evening, 1/31, 2013. It was also form the same number. 內容是我想要你在身邊 我們什麼時候才能真正在一起 please explain it? Could you tell me why she send it to you?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I want you by my side' as '我想要你在身邊' is accurate, but the word choice for 'truly together' as '真正在一起' is incorrect. It should be translated as '真正地在一起' or '真正地在一起的時候'.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫那封簡訊是為了告訴我中文作業該如何表達
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean she send this message to you mainly for helping you with your assignment, what do you mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太已經告訴法官 我正在參加一個含授課程 在那個城裡我被一球要修滿302個學分 我才能結業 當然我也需要做一些練習還有作業

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you explain what are you studying for your master degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'master' in the translation.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是英語教學 在這個學程裡有一些是關於英語教學 文化還有一些是語言能力的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So the degree you are taking is English teaching but you still have some culture communication lessons? Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the meaning of '文化溝通'

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對 我記得至少有三堂課程是跟文化溝通有關的
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of courses in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'related' before the subject 'courses' in their translation.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So could you tell me what assignment was given in this culture and communication courses?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
每個學生的文化溝通作業不盡相同 以我來說 我是一個在台灣的學生 而且我想要拿到 英語教學的學位   為了達到這個目標 我必須展現我的語言能力 由其是中文的掌握 所以我的很多作業是關於中文英文的翻譯
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean because you plan to teach English in Taiwan so the master degree asks you ti have some certificate for the language competence is that right? So you have to finish some assignment and the assignment is about Chinese and English translation, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對 沒錯 我還被要求要加強我的寫作和口語能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok lets go back to the question that you said it was your assingmnet
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對我記得那句話 當我拿到這個句子 我不知道要怎麼把它翻成英文你知道 對於外國人來說有些中文字很難理解 我需要一些幫助 所以我請我的同事幫我 我請她幫我翻譯那些話而且用簡訊寄給我
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean you asked her to translate it for you, so she sent it in message to you, is that right? So the message is only the answer for the translation question?

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊的內容就是我翻譯題的答案
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
And now please check investigatory file 1 page 14-16 All of these content. Please check this content. All of these message are sent on the purpose ofhelping you with the homework so you have got the messages.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對 所有這些簡訊目的都是為了完成我所有的作業

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So as for the suspect that your wife suspect you to have a affair with 王彩華 what will you say about that?
omission or addition	omission of details	王彩燕 (Wang Caiyan) was mistranslated as 王彩華 (Wang Caihua).
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'suspect' should agree with the subject 'your wife', so it should be 'suspects' instead of 'suspect'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'suspect' should be translated as '懷疑' (huáiyí) instead of '針對' (zhēnduì), which means 'target'.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太想太多了 我知道他對於我養家的能力不是很滿意我想要讓法院知道的是 它在我一開始參加這個課程時 一點都不支持我 她跟本不願意幫助我完成我的學位 如果她能更支持我一點 我就不用去問我的同事要答案了 我覺得她要為全部的誤解負責任

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you just said  I thought you may have some fights with your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們婚姻一開始的時候 我們的確曾有過一些很好的時光但我的工作一直是個問題 我試著在台灣蕉葡萄牙文 但工作時數一值不是很穩定 之後我的工作變成我們吵架的原因 我們之間的問題我們會這是三不五時就會吵架  他不相信我已經盡力了 而且我沒有辦法壤她知道我的挫折還有沮喪

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok now let’s turn back to the degree you just mentionedWhen did you start the program did you get the degree?When will it end?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the order of the questions

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010 春天開始這個課程那是一個兩年的課程 我本來在12/22應該完成這個課程 我沒有完成學位因為我有再打工 所以我沒有完成課程所要求的作業  就像我說的 我太太一直沒有很支持我 我感覺我是自己再硬撐著拿到那學位 我後來變得很累而且很挫折
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'December' in '12/22'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我在2010 春天開始這個課程那是一個兩年的課程'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	incorrect translation of 'degree' as '學位' instead of '課程'
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	lack of appropriate greeting or introduction

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean the program is a two year term program but in the end you did not finish it, why ?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the reason for not finishing the program.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法達到課程要求
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when did the last semester that you registered end?

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期結束在2012年秋天
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'registration' in their translation.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the present tense '結束' (end) instead of the past tense '結束了' (ended) to indicate the completion of the semester.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So if you are telling the truth, the end of the semester is at 12/5,2012 after that you would not have any assignment for the course. But the messages between you and the co-worker still continue for 6 months after you finished ….. you stop the program.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有拿到學位 但不代表我不想要提升我的語言能力 雖然我沒有拿到學位但我仍想要讓我的中文變好所以我自己學中文
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of failing the program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '但不代表我不想要提升我的語言能力' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '提升' as 'improve' instead of 'enhance'.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that although you did not complete the degree but you still want to upgrade your Chinese language ability so that you could speak a more fluent Chines, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對 這就是為什麼我請我同事幫忙
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '對' (yes) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '請' (ask) instead of '問' (ask) to convey the meaning of asking for help.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the co worker is as a tutor for you in your case?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是一個家教更像一個朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有 我有提議要付她錢 但她拒絕
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有提議要付她錢' instead of '沒有我有提議要付她錢'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you did not pay her why did she have to reply the message at midnight the time that people should have already fallen asleep? Is this already beyond things that a co worker should do?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
那就是為什麼我說她是一個非常支持我的朋友他用他所有時間來幫助我學中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '她用她所有的時間來幫助我學中文'.
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	The phrase '他用他所有時間來幫助我學中文' is added unnecessarily and does not exist in the original text.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English at that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order of the sentence.

Yes, I am still working there.
對我仍然在那工作
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does the co worker 王采燕still work there ?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the name of the co-worker, 王采燕.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也在那工作 不過我們不再是夥伴
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '不過我們不再是夥伴' instead of '不過我們不再是夥伴'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor , is there anything evidence that you want the court to investigate or anyone witness ?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Prosecutor' after the verb 'is', which is incorrect in English.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena王采燕who is working at the 伯元 cram school to be in court as a witness. And we would want her to explain the relationship she had between her and the plaintiff and we want her to explain the relationship or background information for the messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the name of the witness, which is crucial information.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention the defendant, which is important for understanding the relationship between the witness and the defendant.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention the content and purpose of the messages, which is necessary for the court to understand the relevance of the witness's testimony.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Plaintiff' after the verb 'is' instead of before it.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had done some actions because of the relationship they have and the cram school even tried to persuade 王采燕to quit her job . I would like to verify this with the cram school.
omission or addition	omission of details	missing the mention of 'two people' in the relationship
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	missing the mention of 'cram school' in the actions taken
omission or addition	omission of details	missing the mention of 'queen' before '王采燕'
omission or addition	omission of details	missing the mention of 'verify' before 'with the cram school'

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? The situation now is that the program is end on 12/5, 2012 . There is no reason that you could explain the relationship you and the co worker for helping the assignment. Especially, the interaction always start at 9:00 in the night. It is very doubtful.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master's degree and the date it ended.

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the request for evidence that could help the defendant's case.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the mention of the defendant's need for evidence to support their case.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到法院能找到幫助我的證據 就像我說的我和同事間的簡訊非常平常 我只是想要提升我的中文能力且繼續學中文

omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the year and adds the year 2014 instead of 2014.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today this is the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. This case was filed by the plaintiff, Yu-hua Chen. The main reason for doing so is because the plaintiff’s husband is beyond a workers’ relationship.The plaintiff has discovered intimate messages in the defendants’ text mailbox. In addition, the defendant would make excuses … often make excuses to stay after work and frequently teleconference with his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang.…The information the plaintiff collected proves that the relationship is beyond a working relationship between colleagues.Therefore, she filed the case. The defendant, your wife accuses you of adultery. What’s your plea?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In our preparatory procedure today, our main goal is to inquire the details of the messaging between the defendant and your colleague. Our objective today is to make sure that the defendant really is committing adultery with a colleague. Are the two parties aware of the procedure?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you been married to your husband. Do you have any children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years. We don’t have any children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Were you married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. 4 years ago he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker and her husband met in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the husband's main purpose was to teach Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the recent years, he… has been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense should be present perfect continuous ('has been teaching') instead of simple present ('has been teachin').
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation incorrectly states that he has been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan, while the original text only mentions that his work in Taiwan has been related to Portuguese. The meaning is not accurately conveyed.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we just met, he was a Portuguese Teacher. After we were married, he continued to teach Portuguese. Portuguese is not a language popular among Taiwanese so his teaching hours were… unstable.Sometimes he would have empty…hours up to two months.Afterwards, to obtain a more stable income, he began to teach English. But English was not his mother tongue so he decided to seek advanced education.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
By advanced education, do you mean he sought a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in their translation.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Since he wished to teach English in Taiwan, the degree he sought must be related to English Education. He found a long distance online course from California of the United States… online. So he didn’t need to go to America in person to take the class. So when he obtains all his credits, he also gets his masters degree. His plan was to find an English teacher position in Taiwan through getting a degree from the United States.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'He found a long distance online course from California of the United States… online.' The correct word order should be 'He found an online long distance course from California in the United States.'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the online course is for English teaching specifically. The correct translation should include this detail.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the online course is a distance learning course.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the online course allows him to complete the requirements through correspondence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the degree he will obtain is a master's degree.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the degree he will obtain is in English Education.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that his plan is to find an English teaching job in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is the relationship he has with the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are collegues at the cram school. The cram school has a policy to partner up mandarin teachers and foreign teachers. That woman is the mandarin teacher partnered up with him.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the woman being in the same class as him.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the woman is a colleague at the cram school.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they were in an affair
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first I only found that my husband often stayed long after work hours. I asked many times: It was only an English cram school, why would he need to stay so often after work? He told me that since he had to partner up with a Mandarin teacher, there had to be much effort put in to communicating with each other. At first I didn’t suspect anything at all. Later on, I found that after he would come home, he would receive phone calls. When he picks up the phone, he would never talk on the phone in person, but go to his study room instead. Because of this, I began to suspect him, so I inspected his phone record.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the mention of the specific reason for the husband's long hours at work, which is the need to communicate with a Mandarin teacher.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user fails to mention the suspicion the narrator has towards the husband's behavior.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skips the sentence about the narrator inspecting the husband's phone record.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
…Did you find anything unusual in his cellphone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'his' at the end of the sentence instead of at the beginning, resulting in incorrect word order.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his call records, there was… one number that frequently appeared. So I was… curious and began to inspect his text messages, too. And then I realized he was texting a woman almost everyday.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific information about the number that frequently appeared in the call records.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the critical context of their curiosity or suspicion.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence that mentioned the inspection of text messages.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added unnecessary words like 'too' and 'And then'.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user inserted the phrase 'I realized' which is not present in the original text.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Is it really that serious?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the seriousness of the situation.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it’s a normal, an usual text then there wouldn’t be any problem. But he is a married man, how could he let another person send intimate messages to him like that? Previously, I’ve sent some copies of their text messages of theirs to the court, they should be in the evidence right now.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '已婚的人' as 'married man' instead of 'married person'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing copies of the text messages to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Evidence number one, please. Page 13. There are a few message contents in here. May the defendant please take a look at them? Are these the text messages that are in your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對，這是我手機裡的簡訊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '裡' (in) before '手機' (cell phone), which is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then I have some questions to ask you about these messages. The first text message was sent from the phone number 0958-932XXX at 9:50 PM of November 21st 2012. The content is: “I really miss you, my love.” What does this mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
呃，這是我同事寄給我的。我記得我當時有兩天沒去上班。她有點擔心我。所以才傳這封簡訊給我。我的同事去美國留過學，所以非常開放，這是她講話的方式。至於她稱呼我為「my love」,這只是他對在乎的人表達的意思。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence structure.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect translation of 'concerned' as '擔心' instead of '關心'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect translation of 'open-minded' as '開放' instead of '思想開明'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect translation of 'expressed herself' as '講話的方式' instead of '表達自己'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect translation of 'call' as '稱呼' instead of '稱呼'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect translation of 'people we care' as '在乎的人' instead of '我們關心的人'.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So you mean the person who sent this message was educated in America, she’s more westernized. She’s more open with expressing her affections. So, by calling you my love there isn’t any meaning?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its cultural connotations.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user fails to understand the cultural significance of the phrase '我的愛' and its implications in the context of the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
不，這是好朋友之間很常有的用語，只是表達對彼此的在乎。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation does not capture this meaning.

那她前面那句呢？
What about the previous message before this… name?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我先前提到的，她只是為我擔心而已，我們是同事的關係。我有兩天沒去上班，她自而然地…為我擔心。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她只是為我擔心而已' instead of '只是為我擔心而已她'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'We are partners at work' in their translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of the speaker being away for two days, which is important for understanding why the other person naturally missed them.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
What you mean is the only reason for her doing so is you took two days off from work? And because you were not there to help her in class, she missed you? Is that it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，那就是整件事情的脈絡。沒什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in their translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
All right. The second text message was also sent from the same cell phone number from 11:55pm of January 13th 2013. Inside the text message, it says, “I want to be by your side, when can we be truly together?” What does this mean? Why would a message like this appear in your cellphone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I want you by my side' as 'I want to be by your side', changing the subject of the sentence.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這個訊息給我是想要告訴我我作業裡的回答要怎麼講。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean she sent you this text message to help you with your homework? What do you mean by that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我妻子在法庭中提到的，我當時在修一堂課。那堂課需要修滿30個學分我才能取得學位，所以我當然需要完成一些作業和練習。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you please elaborate on what you really are learning for your masters?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'really' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'really' at the end of the sentence instead of before the verb 'are learning'.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我修的是英語教育的課程。期中，有些課程是漢英語教學相關。有的是漢西方文化或語言能力有關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So your seeking a TESOL masters degree, some courses are related to culture?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'are' in the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'your' instead of 'you're' in the sentence.
cultural transformation	misunderstanding historical or social context	The user misunderstood the context of the sentence and asked if the courses are related to culture, instead of asking if there are courses related to culture.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少有三堂課與文化和傳播有關係。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of courses in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '我' (I) after the verb '記得' (remember), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '課' (courses) instead of '堂課' (class) in their translation.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
Then, what kind of an assignment would you have to finish for the courses in culture and communication?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
每個學生會收到的作業可能都不同。舉我自己的例子來說吧，我人在台灣，然後想要找一份英語教學的工作。為了達成這個目標，然後展現我的能力，我必須表現出我對中文的瞭解。所以我的作業很多都是和中英翻譯有關係。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
What you mean is that because you are seeking a job to teach English in Taiwan, the homework requires you to have Chinese competence as well? So you have to finish certain assignments in your course, and they are often related to Chinese-English translation.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，當然我還被要求要有口說還有寫作能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the detail of 'required to sharpen' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '要求' (required) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect in Chinese word order.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
OK, let’s go back to what we mentioned before, you said this was your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得那句話。當我拿到中文句子時，我不知道英文剛怎麼說。你知道的，有很多中文的句子對外國人來說很難理解。我需要一些幫助，所以我同事來幫我。我請她幫我翻譯那個句子，再把答案寄給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'translate that sentence for me' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb '再' (again) before the verb '把答案寄給我' (sent me the answer), which is incorrect in English.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So the situation was… you gave the Chinese sentence to your colleague and she sent back the English translation of it? So this text message was only an answer for an assignment?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就只是作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
OK, then, let’s take a look at Evidence number 1, page 14 to 16. Please take a look at the content. Are the reason behind sending all these text messages, your homework assignment?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the text messages.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，所有的簡訊都是要幫助我回答我作業的問題。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then may I ask you, may you explain that your wife is accusing you of having an affair with your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the accusation made by the wife.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了。我知道她對我很不滿意，就在于沒辦法照顧好家庭上。法官我希望你知道，從我開始攻讀碩士到現在她一直沒有支持我。她一點也不想幫助我完成學業。她要是更支持我一點，我才不需要請我同事來幫我。我想這所有的誤解應該怪在她身上才對。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	照顧好家庭上 -> supporting the family
grammar and structure	word order errors	法官我希望你知道 -> I want the court to know
omission or addition	omission of details	she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support -> 從我開始攻讀碩士到現在她一直沒有支持我
omission or addition	omission of details	She was not willing to help me complete my degree -> 她一點也不想幫助我完成學業
omission or addition	omission of details	If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me -> 她要是更支持我一點，我才不需要請我同事來幫我
omission or addition	omission of details	I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding -> 我想這所有的誤解應該怪在她身上才對

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, there seems to be an unhappy relationship between the two parties.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們剛結婚的時候，我們的確度過了一些美好的時光。但是我的失業就是一個很大的問題。我嘗試要找到教葡萄牙文的工作，但沒辦法取得很穩定的工作時數，所有工作問題就成為我們兩個人之間的阻礙。我們時常為了這件事情吵架。她不認為我已經盡力了。我也真的沒辦法認清我的狀況與我面臨的問題。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok, then, let’s return to the Masters degree you mentioned. When did your courses begin? Did you finish all your courses? Did you obtain your degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the Masters degree, such as the start and end dates, as well as whether they obtained the degree or not.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年的春天開始上課。它是一個兩年的課程。我本來能在2012年十二月完成學位的。但我最後沒有取得學位，因為當時有堅持的工作然後不夠時間去完成作業。就像我先前提到的，我老婆並不太支持我。我覺得我是孤單一個人地在爭取這個學位。我開始感到累，然後煩惱。

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of 'supportive'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So you mean this…degree requires two years, two terms. But you didn’t finish your degree, why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒辦法去達到所有的課程的要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'finish' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
And when did your last term that you were registered in school end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversed word order

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一學期是2012年的秋天。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'fall' which is a critical detail in the original text.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If what you say is true, then your final term ends at September 12th 2012. And by then all your homework assignments have ended. But you continued to sent text message after the end of your course for over 6 months, how do you explain this?
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the specific date of the end of the semester
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	omitted the information about the text message contact with colleagues

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我雖然沒有拿到學位、沒有完成這些課程，但這並不代表我不想繼續讓我英文進步啊！雖然我沒有完成我的課程，但我想不斷讓我的語言能力進步，所以我繼續努力。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of 'improve my language ability'
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	adding unnecessary information

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So what you mean is that although you didn’t finish your masters courses, you wanted to improve your Mandarin on your own, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為什麼我找我同事幫我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
Then the role your colleague takes is kind of like your tutor, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不單只是我的家教，也是我真心的好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我有主動提出要給她錢，但她拒絕我了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'offered' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '拒絕' (declined) before the subject '她' (she), which is incorrect.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, then why did she reply your text messages late at night when she supposedly should be asleep? Doesn’t this exceed what colleagues do to help each other?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個很支持人的朋友。她犧牲她自己的時間來幫我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '她是一個很支持我的朋友' instead of '她是一個很支持人的朋友'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'learn' in the translation. It should be '幫我學中文' instead of '幫我中文'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still teaching English at that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是，我還在那邊工作。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is your coworker Tsai-Yen Wang still working there?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the name of the coworker, Tsai-Yen Wang.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也正在那邊工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們已經不是搭擋了' instead of '但我們已經不是搭擋了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, are there any witnesses you wish to subpoena or evidences you wish to show?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I wish to subpoena the defendant’s coworker Tsai-Yen wang from the cram school. I would like her to explain the relationship she has between her and the defendant, and her reason for sending the text messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical details of the coworker's name and the name of the cram school.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the name of the coworker after the phrase 'from the cram school', which results in a word order error.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, are there any evidence that you wish for the court to investigate?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'Plaintiff' and 'are' in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard the cram school has taken some actions in response to the relationship between those two people. Somebody has tried to ask Tsai-Yen Wang to leave her position. I wonder if the cram school can… if there are any evidence to show this fact?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Now, the defendant, are there any evidence you wish for the court to help you investigate? The current situation is your degree courses have ended on December 5th 2012. Homework assignments is no excuse for the texting between you and Tsai-Yen Wang. Especially when your text messages are mainly sent after 9 PM at night. This arises suspicion. Do you have any evidence that may help you with your case?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'Tsai-Yen Wang' instead of '王彩燕'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating '中華民國'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到任何證據可以請法院幫我調查的。就像我之前提到的，我和我同事往來的原因其實很簡單：我只想讓我的中文進步，然後不斷地練習中文而已。

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next…witness… the next court for the case will be on June 9th 2014, 4:30PM. The plaintiff and the defendant are required to come to court in person. If it is necessary, you can all appoint lawyers, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

今天庭期到此結束。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today, we’re here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. Yu-Hua Chen filed this case. The main reason is that her husband, John Anderson sent intimate messages to his colleague working at the cram school. The person who filed this case checked the messages of her husband and found some intimate messages. Moreover, the defendant would make up some reasons, umm..for example, to have extra working hours in order to teleconference with his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang. The intimate messages the plaintiff has found out were beyond coworker’s relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff decided to file this case. Defendant, you have violated the adultery, what is your plea?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, our main goal is to ask for the details of the intimate messages sent between the defendant and his colleague, so that we can confirm whether the defendant and his colleague do constitute adultery. Do both parties understand our procedure?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

我明白
Yes.

I understand.
明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, plaintiff, how long have you been married to your husband? Do you two have any children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband, plaintiff?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve been married for four years, and we do not have any children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Were you married in Taiwan or in a foreign country?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'you and your husband' in the translation.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan in order to teach Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Then for the past few years, has his work always been teaching Portuguese?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, and after we got married, he was still teaching Portuguese. However, among Taiwanese, Portuguese is not a very prevalent and famous language. Therefore, his teaching hours are not too many. Sometimes, he even had a period between a month or two between jobs. Afterwards, in order to have a more stable income, he decided to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English; therefore, he decided to learn English and seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
What you mean by “seeking an advanced degree” is that he planned to pursue a higher degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of '進修' as 'seeking an advanced degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
 No. He hopes to teach English in Taiwan; therefore, he needs to receive a degree which is related to English TESOL, and he found a distance learning program which is launched in California. Through this distance learning program, he’s able to learn online without flying to America. Therefore, after receiving the credits, he will be able to receive a master’s degree. His plan was that through getting this master’s degree, he will be able to teach English in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the information that the distance learning program is offered by a university in California.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence about the program being completed through correspondence.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase 'through getting this master’s degree' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not accurate and does not match the original text.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then I would like to ask what is the true relationship between his and the person who he had an affair with?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
Well, they are colleagues at the cram school. At the cram school, the woman was partnered with my husband, and the woman was a Chinese teacher, and my husband an English teacher.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
Then how can you proof that they did have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'proof' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'proof' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'can'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
Well, at the beginning, I just noticed my husband often worked for longer hours at the cram school. And I asked him many times about how come? It was just a cram school! There’s no need, no way to have longer working hours. He told me that he needed to discuss about teaching matters and communicate with his Chinese partner. Therefore, at the beginning, I didn’t doubt him at all. But afterwards, I’ve found out that he will often receive calls after work. The strange this was, when he was answering these calls, he would just go back to his study room and answer the calls instead of answering them in front of me. Therefore, this made me very skeptical of him, and I checked his mobile phone.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the detail that the husband stays at the cram school to work, not just for longer hours.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user leaves out the context that the husband's phone calls are suspicious and contribute to the wife's skepticism.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user has a few instances of incorrect word order, such as 'the strange this was' instead of 'the strange thing was'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user does not use proper punctuation, such as missing commas after introductory phrases.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Then did you find anything wrong or anything strange?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'wrong' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
Well, I’ve found out that one number appeared very, very often in his cell phone record. Therefore, I was so curious that I checked his instant messages. Then, I found out that he sent messages with a woman nearly every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the phone number and the frequency of the messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'very' in the wrong position in the sentence.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
It’s just merely messages. How about the content? Are they unusual or intimate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they were just normal messages, then I’m okay with that. However, he is married to me, how can he allow that woman to send him such intimate messages? I provided some content of the messages to the court earlier. I believe they’re in the folder.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '已婚的人' as 'married to me' instead of 'married person'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court and the location of the messages in the folder.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Let’s look at evidence one, page thirteen. Defendant, please take a look at some of the messages here. Were these messages the same with the messages in your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的。一模一樣。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the cell phone in their translation.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
 Then I would ask you some questions according to these messages. The first message appears to be sent by someone, whose number was 0958932, at 9 pm, November 31, 2012, and the content was, I really miss you, my love.” What does this mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
喔，那是我同事發給我的啊。我記得我那時候請假，請了兩天。她那時很擔心我吧。那就是為甚麼她會發那一封訊息給我。而且她是在美國長大、受教育的，所以她是一個非常開放的女生。那就是她講話的方式和表達的方式啊。至於「我的愛」，只是互相叫對方會用的辭啊，並沒有代表甚麼意思。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Okay, so do you mean that the person who sent this message to you was westernized because she was educated in the US? Therefore, she was very open with her feelings, and the word “my love” doesn’t mean anything, is that right?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對啊，當然沒有意思啊， 因為那只是親密的朋友或好朋友之間的稱呼而以。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation does not capture this meaning.

那她前面那句呢？
Then how about the previous sentence that she sent?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我剛剛已經提到了，她那時候非常擔心我，而且我們是工作夥伴! 我兩天沒去工做啊，她當然會想我啊!
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Okay, what you mean is, because you haven’t been to work for two days; therefore you colleague missed you and was worried about you? Moreover, without your assistance, she missed you? Was that merely the reason?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，內容就是這樣子，所以我的那一封訊息根本不算甚麼啊!
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the details of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, let’s look at the second message, sent by the same person at 11:55 pm, January 13, 2013. The content was, “I want you by my side, when will we be together?” So what did this sentence mean? Why did this person want to send you this sort of content?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'truly together' as 'be together'.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
因為她要教我如何用中文表達這一種內容。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Oh, so you mean she sent you this message in order to teach you, assist you, explain to you how to translate sentences? What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太跟庭上說的，我正在攻讀碩士學位。要順利拿到學位，我必須拿到30學分。當然是要做一些作業、一些練習啊。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Please explain clearly to me, what were you studying for concerning your master’s program?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the assistant's master's program.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
就是英語教學的碩士學位啊。在學位裡面，還有分英語教學的課程、文化的課程、和交流的課程。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the master's degree in their translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the specific courses related to English teaching, culture, and language competence in their translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '就是英語教學的碩士學位啊' which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user inserted the phrase '和交流的課程' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order in the translation is different from the original text.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include any punctuation marks in their translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '碩士學位' to translate 'program' which is not an accurate translation.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate 'TESOL' in their translation.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you mean that this master’s degree was mainly about English teaching; however, you are also studying about culture interaction, right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，至少有三門課是跟文化交流、溝通相關的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of courses in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in their translation.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what sort of assignment will be assigned in these courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'sort' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'sort' at the end of the sentence instead of before the verb 'will be assigned'.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
每個人所被分配到的作業不一樣。因為我现在在台灣，希望找到一份英語教學的工作。因此，為了達成這個目標，我必須能證明我有足夠的中文能力。因此我有很多作業都是有關中英字句的翻譯。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating important terms

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean that because you planned to teach English in Taiwan; therefore, this master’s degree will be able to proof that you have enough Chinese language competence? Therefore, you have the finish the assignments being assigned in these courses, and the assignments include Chinese and English sentence translation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating 'master's degree'
semantic conversion	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	literal translation of 'proof'

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對沒錯，而且我有必須加強我口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '而且我必須加強我口說和寫作能力。'

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, then let’s start again. You said that this was your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the word order in the question

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得。當我拿到那一份作業的時候，我不知道它是甚麼意思。而且你知道，對有些外國人來說，有些中文字句非常難懂。因此，我非常需要幫助，所以我就問了我的同事啊。我請她幫我翻那一句話，然後透過簡訊傳給我答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of receiving Chinese sentences as an assignment.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of not knowing how to say the Chinese sentences in English.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of asking for help from a colleague.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of receiving the translation answer through a text message.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我記得' (I remember) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the comma.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '當我拿到那一份作業的時候' (When I got the assignment) after the sentence instead of at the beginning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我不知道它是甚麼意思' (I didn't know what it meant) after the sentence instead of at the beginning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '對有些外國人來說' (For some foreigners) after the sentence instead of at the beginning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '因此，我非常需要幫助' (Therefore, I really needed help) after the sentence instead of at the beginning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '所以我就問了我的同事啊' (So I asked my colleague) after the sentence instead of at the beginning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我請她幫我翻那一句話' (I asked her to translate that sentence for me) after the sentence instead of at the beginning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '然後透過簡訊傳給我答案' (and sent me the answer through a text message) after the sentence instead of at the beginning.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Okay, so what you mean was that at that time, you first sent the Chinese version of that sentence, and she helped you translate it and sent you that sentence in English? Is that right? And that means this message was just the answer to your assignment?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'you asked your colleague' from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order of the sentence, resulting in a grammatically incorrect structure.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
沒錯，只是作業的答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the homework assignment.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
 Okay, then let’s take a look at evidence one, page 14 to 16, and let’s take a look at all the content of all the messages. Please, just take a look at these contents. And the main reason was, because you want to finish your assignment, and you asked your colleague to translate them for you?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，所有的訊息都是因為我要完成我的作業，拿到答案，所以才會有這些訊息。
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '拿到答案' (get the answers), which is not present in the original text.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then how about your wife filing the adultery case against you and your colleague Ms. Tsai-Yen Wang?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the wife filing the adultery case.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'filing the adultery case' after the mention of the wife, resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'filing the adultery case' instead of 'accusing of adultery', which changes the meaning.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對於這事真的想太多了。我知道她對於我提供家庭一些資金啊不是很滿意。在此，我想告訴庭上，我在攻讀碩士學位期間，我太太從來沒有關心我。而且她也沒有協助我完成我的碩士學位。如果她願意支持我、幫助我的話，那我也不會請我的同事幫我啊。所以我覺得她才是要被責怪的對象。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your saying, it seems that between you and your wife, the relationship is not very good.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
結婚後的一段時間，我們相處確實很好啦。但是最大的問題在於我有沒有工作。我在台灣試著教葡萄牙語，但是我的時數很少。因此這個問題就成了我們兩人之間的一到牆。我們為這件事就一直吵架，吵了好多次。她不認為我已經盡力了。她也不了解我面臨這種窘境的時候，感到多受挫、多憤怒。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, then let’s go back to the master’s degree that we’ve just mentioned. When did you start that master’s program? Did you receive a master’s degree? Has it ended?

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在春季2011年入學的。我需要攻讀兩年。我應該是要在103年的12月就要完成這個學位。但是因為那時我兼職，導致我無法準時完成我的學位，因為沒時間寫作業。如同我剛剛所提的，我太太一點都沒支持我。結果我那時就覺得非常的無助啊，好像是我自己孤拎拎的要拿到那個學位。因此我感到非常的勞累、受挫。
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'Spring' in the year of enrollment
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted '2010' in the year of enrollment
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'December' in the expected completion month
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted '2012' in the expected completion year
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'part-time' in the reason for not finishing the program
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'course' in 'course assignments'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'never' in 'my wife has never been very supportive'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'all alone' in 'I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'too' in 'I became too tired and too frustrated'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
Okay, so you said that this master’s degree requires a two-year study; however, you didn’t received that degree on time, why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
因為我無法如期完成課程所需的作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
Then when was the last date you registered for the program?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
是在103年的秋季班註冊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific year (2012) in their translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'fall 2012' as '103年的秋季班', which does not accurately convey the intended meaning.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
According to your statement, the semester that you finished the course would be December 5, 2012, and after your complete that semester, you won’t have any assignment, right? However, the colleague kept sending your messages six months after your study, why was that
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '結束日期'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding of '中華民國'

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我那時候是還沒有拿到碩士學位，但是那又並不代表我不想增進我的語言能力。縱使我沒有拿到那個學位，我依然想要我的中文能力進步啊，自己字學啊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of not finishing the program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '那時候' (at that time) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '我'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '字學' (study characters) instead of '學習' (study/learn).

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that even if you didn’t successfully get that master’s degree, you still hope to improve you Chinese ability, is that so?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對啊，而且那就是為什麼我會尋求我的同事幫助。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the role that your colleague was playing equals to your mentor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'mentor' does not accurately convey the meaning of '家教' (tutor).

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，還是我真正的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Then, did you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'you' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有喔，沒有付錢給她。我有提過要付給她，但是她拒絕了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker offered to pay.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '付錢給她' (pay her) before the negation '沒有' (did not), resulting in a word order error.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t even pay her, then why would she be willing to send you messages in the middle of the night, when she could just sleep? Don’t you think that this was just beyond coworker’s relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
我才會說她是一個非常好的朋友啊。她願意占用她自己的時間，幫助我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是一個非常好的朋友' instead of '我才會說她是一個非常好的朋友'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the detail that the friend was helping the user learn Chinese. The phrase '幫助我學中文' is missing in the translation.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still teaching at that same cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'same' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還是在那裏工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
So, is your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang still working at that cram school, too?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the cram school in the translation.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
對，她還在那裏工作，但我們已經不是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是搭檔了' instead of '但已經不是搭檔了我們'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Does the prosecutor need to subpoena or have other witnesses?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of further investigation or evidence.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena the defendant’s coworker Tsai-Yen Wang who works at Po-Yuan cram school, and come here as witness. I would ask her to clearly state the background and goal of the messages she sent to the defendant.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'subpoena' and 'court' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' after the object 'the defendant's coworker', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'subpoena' instead of '傳訊', which means 'summon' or 'call as a witness'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '證人身分' which means 'as a witness'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, do you wish the court to investigate on any evidence?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Plaintiff' after the verb 'do you wish', resulting in incorrect word order.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I’ve heard that the cram school has already taken some action against the relationship between them. About their action, they have persuaded Tsai-Yen Wang to quit her job. I would like to ask whether it is possible to verify this issue.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the two people involved in the relationship.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'About their action' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'persuaded' instead of 'tried to persuade', which changes the meaning.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Now, currently, the situation is that you finished your master’s degree on December 5, 2012, Therefore, making an excuse of doing an assignment with Tsai-Yen Wang is not really reasonable. Especially, the interaction between you two often appears after 9 pm. That makes one very, very skeptical. Do you have any evidence which may help you with your case? Now, let me ask the defendant, what would you like the court to investigate on the case?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing comma
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong translation of '起人疑竇'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating '希望法庭為你調查的事證'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating '案情'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
沒有，我並沒有證據要庭上代表我去偵查。之前已經提過了，我和同事之間的交流、互動是非常簡單的。只是想要增進我的語文能力，繼續學中文啊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'improving language ability' and 'continuing to learn Chinese'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我並沒有證據要庭上代表我去偵查' at the beginning of the sentence, which disrupts the natural word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '庭上代表我去偵查' to translate 'investigate on my behalf', which does not accurately convey the meaning.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The court will set the time to ask the witness to come to the court at 4:30 pm, June 9, 2012. The plaintiff and the defendant need to come to the court. And if it’s necessary, each party can ask for a lawyer.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the year and mistakenly translated it as 2012 instead of 2014.

我明白。
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
明白。

今天庭期到此結束。
The court is adjourned.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The plaintiff, Yu-Hua, Chen, filed this case. The reason for the plaintiff to file this case is that her husband, John Anderston, is beyond co-workers’ relationship with a person. The plaintiff found some intimate messages and records in the defendant’s cell phone. Furthermore, the defendant, John Anderston, found reasons for working late in the cram school and conducted tele-conferencing with Chai-yan Wang. The contents collected by the plaintiff were beyond co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, your wife is wondering whether you have an affair with others, so she accused you.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the court will focus on the details of these tele-conferencings and intimate messages. The purpose of this procedure is to see whether the interactions between John Anderston and Chai-yan Wang constitute the adultery. Did both parties understand this procedure?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff. How long have you got married with the defendant? Did you have a child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to the defendant?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The term 'plaintiff' should be translated as '告訴人' instead of '妳先生'.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years, and we don’t have any child.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'husband' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the plural form 'we' with the singular verb 'don't'. It should be 'we don't have any children'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or other countries?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'your husband' in the translation.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I met him in Taiwan.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'I met each other' does not accurately convey the meaning of '我跟我先生是在台灣認識的'. It should be 'I met my husband in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the detail that the speaker is referring to their husband. It should be 'I met my husband in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The translation leaves out the context that the husband came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese. It should be 'Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.'

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past years, his job in Taiwan is to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we knew each other initially, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan; his teaching hours were not stable. Sometimes, there had been a period between works for months. In order to have stable incomes, he decided to teach English instead. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek a advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wanted to seek a advanced degree. Did he want to get a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of studying in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan. The degree he wanted to get is about English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California in the United Stated on the Internet. This program allowed him to learn by on-learning, so he didn’t have to go abroad. After he finished all the courses of the program, he could get the degree. He planed to get the degree so that he can teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So, what is the relationship between the person he have an affair with, Chai-yan Wang?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school. The cram school staff arranged one Chinese teacher partnering with a foreign teacher. Chai-yan Wang is the Chinese teacher.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have some extramarital affairs?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
Initially, I noticed that he often stayed late in the cram school for working. I had asked him before because it was just a cram school to teach English. How can he work so late? He told me that because his partnered with a Chinese teacher, they had to discuss more in detail. In the beginning, I did not suspect of him. Later, he often got some phone calls after he came home. After getting the calls, he all went to the study room to talk and did not talk before me. This behavior made me suspect, so I checked his cell phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there any doubtful clue in his cell phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'doubtful' in their translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his calling record, there is one number showing up very often. So, I checked his text messages with that number. After I checked text messages, I found that he sends messages with a woman every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the content of the text messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Sending text messages is not a big deal. Is that very inappropriate?
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the polite tone of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If this is a normal text message, that’s all. But he has got married with me, how can he send intimate messages with another woman? I have provided some details about these messages to the court, and these details may be included in the investigatory files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please check page 13 on the investigatory file 1. These are the contents taken from those messages. Please check it. Were these contents from your messages?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是，這是從我的手機簡訊中取下來的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '從' (from) before '手機' (cell phone), which is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, the court will ask you some questions in terms of this content. The first is the message sent at 9:50 on November 31st, 2012, and the number is 0958-932XXX. The content is “我非常想念你.” What does that mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I really miss you, my love' as '我非常想念你' is incorrect because it does not include the term 'my love'.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我一個同事發給我的。我記得那時候我請兩天假。她非常擔心。這才是為什麼她傳簡訊給我。我同事是在美國受教育的，她的思想十分開放。這就是她說話的方式。至於裡面說的愛，只是我們關懷他人的說法而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect word choice
cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You said that the woman was educated in the United States, so her concept is more westernized. The expression about her emotion is more open-minded. So, the word “my love” does not have some other implications, does it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its cultural implications.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user fails to understand the cultural significance of the phrase '我的愛' and its implications in the context of the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
這只是好朋友間會講的，沒有什麼特別的意思。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, while the user's translation suggests that it is just something friends say without any special meaning.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the last sentence?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
如前所說，她非常擔心我，我們是工作同事。我兩天沒到，她當然會掛念我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我兩天沒到' instead of '我兩天到沒'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So, you mean that the person sent this message to you because you had two day off at that time? Without your assistance in class, she was very missing you. Is that all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對，沒錯，這簡訊不是什麼大問題啊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in the translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent at 11:55 p.m. on January 13th, 2013. The message is that “我想要妳陪我，我們什麼時候能在一起呢.” What does this sentence mean? Why is there such a message
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這個句子的原因是，要怎麼把這個句子寫成中文，這是我們作業的內容。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added unnecessary information by including the phrase '這是我們作業的內容' (this is the content of our assignment), which is not present in the original text.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Did you mean that she sent you this message because she wanted to help you complete you assignment? What dose that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太跟庭上所說，我有英語教學的課程。在那個課堂中，我必須要取得30學分，才能擁有學位。當中我會有些作業和活動。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you explain the degree you were perusing?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'master's' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'were perusing' before the subject 'you' instead of after.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是英語教學。在那課程中，有英語教學課程，也有文化背景的相關教學。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you are pursuing the degree from the graduate school of TESOL, and in this program, there are some classes related to culture competence. Is that true?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
沒錯，我記的有3個是有關文化溝通的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of courses in the translation.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
In this class, what were the assignments given within it?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
在文化溝通這堂課中，每個學生的作業都不同。拿我自身舉例。我想在台灣找個英語教學的職位。為了這個目標，我必須要有能力來證明我的中文能夠變通。所以在作業上，有許多中英翻譯。

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, you mean that you wanted to teach in Taiwan. Therefore, in the courses of the program, you have to proof your Chinese competence. So, you have to finish the assignments arranged by the program so that you can prove your language competence. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the assignments and the purpose of proving language competence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'proof' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，我也想增進我的聽力還有寫作能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'speaking' skills in their translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'writing' skills in their translation.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, let us go back to the sentence. This sentence is your assignment. Is it true?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得這個句子。當我拿到一個英文句子時，我不知怎麼用中文講它。有些句子外國人很難說。我需要些幫忙，所以就找我同事。我問他怎麼翻譯這個句子，她就用簡訊回我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by the colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb before the subject in the sentence '我問他怎麼翻譯這個句子' (I asked him how to translate this sentence). The correct word order should be '我問他怎麼翻譯這個句子' (I asked him to translate this sentence).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '簡訊' (text message) instead of '答案' (answer) to describe the response from the colleague.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you mean that you asked the collogue to translate the sentence into Chinese and that she sent back with the English sentence. Is that true? That is to say, the sentence in the text message is that answer of your assignment. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding of the original meaning
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding of cultural context

That message was only the answer to my homework.
這個句子只是我作業的答案而已。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now, please check page 14-16 on the investigatory file 1.Please check the content. Because you asked for help to complete your assignment, she sent these messages. Is that right?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，這些簡訊都是為了要完成作業而傳的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the messages being referred to.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation in terms of your wife’s doubt you have an affair with Chai-yan, Wang?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the user's wife in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the name 'Chai-yan, Wang' before the phrase 'you have an affair with', which is incorrect in English.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我老婆想太多了。我知道他對我有固定收入這件事非常不滿意。告訴庭上，我的老婆在課程上並沒給予我任何協助。她根本沒有意願要幫我完成這個學位。如果她多幫我一點，我就不會像我同事求救啊。我覺得她應該為件事被譴責。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you just said, you two are not very happy with each other.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the negative tone of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在婚姻剛開始，我們真的過得很快樂。問題就在我的就業狀況。我想在台灣教葡萄牙語，但授課時數都不是很穩定。我的工作情況變成我們相處的問題。因
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of fighting over the employment issue.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the sentence '問題就在我的就業狀況' in the wrong position.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '教葡萄牙語' as 'teaching Portuguese' instead of 'teaching Portuguese language'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s go back to the program. When did you start participating in the program? Is that finished? Did you get your degree?

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年剛開始時參與的。這是2年的課程。我應該在2012年12月完成的。但我沒辦法在這2年內完成學位，因為現在工作太忙了，沒辦法完成所有的作業。就像我剛說的，我的老婆根本不支持我。我覺得只能靠自己的力量來完成這個學位。我非常勞累、感到挫折。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You just said that this program is a two-year program, and you had not finished it yet. What’s the reason?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the reason for not completing the program.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒辦法達成這些課程所有的需求。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When was the last registration date? When did it end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一次註冊的時間是2012年的秋天。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'semester' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '2012年的秋天' before the verb '註冊', resulting in incorrect word order.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
According to what you just said, the program ended on December 5th, 2012. There is some duration between the dates you just said. So, at that time, you don’t have any assignments, right? However, after the program ended, you still got messages from the person for 6 months. Why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original meaning

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然我沒有完成那個課程，但就不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。雖然我沒有完成這個課程，但我還是想要增進我的中文能力，所以我就自學。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that although you fell to finish the program, you still want to enhance your Chinese language competence and want to speak fluent Chinese. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，所以我就請我同事幫忙我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, this co-worker served as the Chinese tutor for you. Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，而是我真正的好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，雖然我有要付她錢，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '雖然我有要付她錢，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
Without your payment, why did still send you messages in the very late time when most people go to bed? Are these interaction beyond co-workers’ relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我說這個朋友非常支持我。她用她自己的時間幫我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Did you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'teach' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我還在那邊工作。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does this person still work there as well?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague's name, Wang Caiyan.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那家補習班上課，但我們現在沒有跟她搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們現在沒有跟她搭檔了，她也還在那家補習班上課。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any need to subpoena another person in this case?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'investigating evidence' in the original text.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena the defendant’s colleague, Chai-yan, Wang, who is working in the Bo-Yuan cram school as the witness in this case. I would like to ask her to explain her relationship with the defendant and to elaborate the purposes of these text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The plaintiff, is there any evidence which you hope the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'plaintiff' after the verb 'is'.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that that cram school has taken some actions about the relationship between my husband and that party. One of the actions is that the cram school asked Chai-yan, Wang to quit her job. I want the cram school to proof and make more explanations for that.

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'party' instead of 'queen'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the term 'queen'

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
The defendant, is there any evidence that you hope the court to investigate for you? Now, the situation is that your program had ended on December 5th, 2012. There is no reason to explain why you two send messages to each other after you fell the program, especially the time when you sent text messages and interacted with each other, because the time is too late. Do you have any evidence to explain for yourself?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master's degree program and the year it ended.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'after you fell the program' in an incorrect position in the sentence.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the past tense 'had ended' instead of the correct present perfect tense 'has ended' to indicate that the program ended in the past but is still relevant.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's interaction with Wang Caiyan through text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'because the time is too late' in an incorrect position in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's need for evidence to support their case.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我手邊沒有任何證據和資料來佐證。就像我說，我們兩個傳簡訊、互動的理由很簡單。我只是想增進我的語文能力，和繼續學中文而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'the court' in their translation, which is a critical detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '和繼續學中文而已' (and continue to learn Chinese) at the end of the sentence, which disrupts the natural word order in Chinese.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
Then, the court will set the next court date at 4:30 p.m. on July 9th, 2014 for the inquiry procedure. The defendant, you have to attend the court. It is necessary that both of you can have a lawyer at that day. Do you understand?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the year and month in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the correct date for the court hearing.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plantiff, how long have you married with your husband? Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。

omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a period at the end of each sentence.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry with your husband in Taiwan? Or other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
 We met each other in Taiwan, He taught Portuguese in Taiwan 4 years ago.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker's husband came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'taught' before the subject 'He', resulting in incorrect word order.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So he has taught Portuguese in Taiwan in the past years?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he still taught Portuguese.However, Portuguese is not so popular in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hours is not stable.Sometimes, he did not work for 1 or 2 months. Therefore, in order to have more income, he started to teach English.However, since his mother tongue is not English, he decided to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You have mentioned he is going to seek an advanced degree, does it mean that he has to study for a degree in Taiwan….
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of studying in Taiwan for a degree.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
NO.Because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, he has to get a degree for English teaching.He has found a distance learning program provided from California,Therefore, he can have a distance learning in Taiwan, rather than going to America.After he finished this distance program, he can get a degree.The reason he takes this distance learning program is that he can get a job of English teacher.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is his relationship with the person he has an affair with?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in cram school.In that cram school, they are partners. One is Chinese teacher, and the other is English teacher. She is the Chinese teacher.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the cram school has both Chinese and English teachers.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the two co-workers are in the same class.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'In that cram school' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'They are co-workers'.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know that they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
First, I only realized that my husband often work late in cram school.I have asked him the question that how come you have so many work to do in a English cram school?He told me that he has to partner with a Chinese teacher. They have many things to discuss with.At first, I really didn’t suspect him.However, I have found he usually picked up some phone calls after he got home.When he answered the phone, he would go to the study room instead of talking in front of me.That the reason why I started to suspect him and I checked his cellphone.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the husband works late in the cram school.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the context that the husband's behavior made the wife suspicious.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence about the wife checking her husband's cellphone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Do you find any problem in his cellphone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'unusual' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I often see the same phone number in his phone book.Therefore, I was so curious about it so I checked his text message.Then I found that he texts with a woman almost every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of being curious about the phone number in the original text.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context of checking the text messages after being curious about the phone number.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence about being curious and directly mentioned checking the text messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
It is just a message. Is something improper in the message?
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural norms and etiquette associated with messaging.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
 If it is just a normal message, it’s okay.However, he is a married person. How can he let other text him with some intimate messages?I have provided some intimate messages for the court. It should be in the file.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
As the file one, page.13.Defendant, please see the content of these messages. Are these messages taken from your cellphone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的,這是我手機上的訊息
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '是的' (yes) at the beginning of the translation, which is not present in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I am going to ask you some questions about these messages.The message is from the phone number 0958-932***. The date is 9:50 p.m., Nov.31st, 2012.The content is “我真的很想你,親愛的” what is this about?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I really miss you, my love' as '我真的很想你,親愛的' is accurate in terms of meaning, but the word choice for 'my love' could be improved.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我一個同事傳給我的我記得那時候,我休了兩天假他有點擔心我所以他才會傳這封信我的同事是在美國接受教育的,因此思想很開放這是他表達情感的方式至於”親愛的”,這是對我們所關心的人的一個統稱

grammar and structure	word order errors	word order errors
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing or misplaced punctuation
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	mismatched meaning
cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that the person who sent you this message has spent some time in western countries. Therefore, she is more open-minded.She is also open-minded in expressing her emotions?Therefore, the words ”my love” do not have much meaning, right?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿 就只是好朋友間的稱呼
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation simply states that it is a term of address between good friends.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the last sentence?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛說的,我們是同事,他就只是擔心我當我不在兩天,他自然會想我啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean that it because that you took two days off, she sent you this message. Without your assistance, she misses you. Is that all?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對阿 就這樣啊 這訊息又沒什麼
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'Yes, that was the context' which provides important information about the previous conversation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'The message was no big deal' which adds context to the message being discussed.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message is sent at 11:55 p.m. Jan.13th, 2013, and is from the same phone number.The content is that”我希望你在我身邊,什麼時候能成真呢?”Then what does this mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I want you by my side' as '我希望你在我身邊' is accurate. However, the translation of 'when can we be truly together?' as '什麼時候能成真呢?' is not accurate. It should be translated as '我們什麼時候能真正在一起呢?'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他寫這封信只是想告訴我怎麼寫作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you this message to help you do your homework? How?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of the original text

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太說的,我有參加遠距教學課程我需要修習30學分,才能得到學位所以我當然需要完成一些作業
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about attending a Master's program and the requirement of completing assignments and exercises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '就像我太太說的' (as my wife has informed) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include any punctuation marks to separate the different parts of the sentence.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Please explain that what did you learn from this program?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the program the speaker is studying for.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是關於英語教學 課程內容有分幾個部分, 有英語教學,文化及語言能力等等
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you get a degree in TESOL, but there are some courses about culture communication, right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對阿 我記得至少有三堂課是關於文化溝通
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the subject '三堂課' (three courses) instead of after it.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '關於' (about) instead of '相關' (related) in their translation.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What is the assignment from the culture and communication course?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the assignment.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
針對每個不同的學生,會有不同的作業就我而言我在台灣,並且想得到一份英語教學的工作為了達到這個目標,我必須證明我有足夠的中文能力因此,我有很多關於英中句子翻譯的作業
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove that you have certain language competence in Chinese, right?So you have to finish some assignments in this course, and they are English-to-Chinese translation of sentences? Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'English-to-Chinese' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是阿 就是這樣啊 我另外也需要加強我的口說和寫作技巧
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, let’s go back to the last sentence. You said that it’s your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿 我還記得這句子當我拿到這個中文句子時,我不知道怎麼翻譯你也知道吧, 有些中文字對外國人來說很難記得我需要一些幫助阿 所以我找我同事我請他幫我翻譯,然後再傳給我
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'translate that sentence for me' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我請他幫我翻譯' (I asked him to help me translate) at the end of the sentence instead of after '我找我同事' (I asked my colleague).
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include any punctuation marks in the translation.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Your co-worker translated this sentence into English and sent to you, right?That is to say, the content of this message is just the answer of my homework.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
是的 就只是我作業的解答
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the homework assignment.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now please see the file one, page.14-16.Please see these contents.  Are these messages all about your assignment?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對的 所有簡訊都是關於作業上的問題
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about the purpose of the messages being for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What is your explanation about your wife charged you of having an affair with Cai-Ian Wang?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了我知道他對我對於這個家的付出感到不滿我希望庭上知道,打從一開始,他就不支持我修這課程他不願意幫助我完成這份課程如果他願意幫我的話,我就不用問我同事拉 因此 我認為他要為這些誤會負責
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, there seems to be some disagreements between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '相處不愉快' as 'disagreements' instead of 'unpleasant interactions'.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在剛結婚的時候,我們的確相處得不錯  但問題就出在我的工作我試著在台灣教葡萄牙文,但卻沒有穩定的工作時數因此我的工作成了我們之間的大問題我們常為了這件事爭吵他不相信我真的已經盡力了我不知道要怎樣讓他了解我的困難和挫折

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, let’s talk about the aforementioned courses.When did it start? Did you get your degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question about when the master's program ended.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question about whether the user got their degree.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
 我的課程是在2010年春天開始 這是兩年的課程我應該是要在2012年12月完成我並沒有完成這課程,因為我在做兼職的工作,沒有足夠的時間完成作業就像我說的,我太太並不支持我做這件事我覺得我只有一個人在努力得到這學位我覺得很累而且很挫折

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
This is a two-year program. Why did you fail to finish it?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒辦法達到所有課程的要求
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'finish' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When did your last semester end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
最後一學期是2012年秋天
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'registration' from the translation.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include any punctuation marks in the translation.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
According to what you said, after Dec.5, 2012. You have no more assignments after then, right?Then how come you still contact with your co-worker…….
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我雖然沒辦法完成課程,但這並不代表我不想增進我的語言能力 即使我拿不到學位,我還是很努力地想靠自己增進我的中文能力
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So even if you failed the program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對 這就是為什麼我尋求同事的幫助
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '對' (meaning 'yes') at the beginning of the sentence, which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '這就是為什麼' (meaning 'that's why') at the end of the sentence, instead of at the beginning as in the original text.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So this co-worker just plays a role like your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是我的家教,更是我的好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Do you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
我想付他錢,但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The subject and verb should be in the correct order.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
Why she answered you in the midnight even if you didn’t pay her?Is this behavior beyond co-worker’s relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說他是個很支持我的朋友阿他不惜犧牲自己的時間幫助我學中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我才說他是個很支持我的朋友，他不惜犧牲自己的時間幫助我學中文。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'she' as '他' (he) is incorrect. It should be translated as '她' (she).

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still wok in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
對阿 我還在那教英文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is Cai-Ian Wang still working there, too?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the name of the colleague, Cai-Ian Wang.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
他還在那工作啊,只是我們不是搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you want to subpoena any witness or to investigate any other evidence?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'want' before the subject 'Prosecutor', which is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
 I hope to subpoena Cai-Ian Wang who works in Bo-Yuan cram school as a witness. I want her to explain the relationship between her and the defendant. Also, the details of the messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the critical details of the purpose of the witness's testimony and the background of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plantiff, do you have any other evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'plaintiff' and 'court' in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has taken some actions about their relationship.Among that, I heard that the cram school has persuaded Cai-Ian Wang to quit the job. I wonder whether I can ask the cram school for this.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the two people's relationship.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the crucial context of the actions taken by the cram school.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Cai-Ian Wang' before the verb 'persuaded', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'persuaded' instead of 'tried to persuade', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you?The situation is that your program has finished on Dec.5th, 2012.You have no reason to text message with Cai-Ian Wang Especially that you two also text message to each other after 9:00 p.m.Do you have any evidence to help you with this case?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	incorrect translation

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到任何可以請庭上為我調查的證據就像我說的,我們之間傳簡訊的原因是很單純的我真的只是想要增強我的語言能力並學中文

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court for questioning of witness is set at 4:30 p.m. June 9th, 2014.Plantiff and Defendant, you have to show up. If necessary, both parties have right to a lawyer.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of adultery. The plaintiff Yu Hua Chen file this case. It is because his husband has something with his co-worker. The plaintiff has found some intimate messages in his cell phone. In addition, the plaintiff’s husband will find reasons for working late or tele-conferences with his co-worker Cai Yan Wang. The messages that the plaintiff has collected has been beyond the co-workers’ relationship. As a result, she files this case. The defendant, your wife suspects you of adultery, what’s your pleat?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the purpose is to ask the messages between the defendant and his co-worker. The purpose is to prove if the defendant commits the crime of adultery with his co-worker. Do you understand the procedure?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The plaintiff, how many years have you been married with your husband? Do you have any child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How many years have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'has you been married'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The possessive pronoun 'your' should be used instead of 'you'. It should be 'married to your husband' instead of 'married with your husband'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years and we do not have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Are you married in Taiwan or broad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'abroad or in Taiwan', not 'in Taiwan or abroad'.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I meet with my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past years, did he also teach Portuguese?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in the translation.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued to teach Portuguese. However, because the Portuguese is not so common language that people learn in Taiwan, so his teaching hours are not so fixed. Sometimes the period between jobs will be two months. Then he hoped he can get the fixed income, so he started to teach English. However, because his mother language is not English, he decided to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree, is he want to get a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of studying in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he hoped to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he achieved has to be English teaching. He found a distant learning program which is provided by the California in America on the Internet. He can complete his courses with the distant learning without going to the America. In this way, he can achieve the doctor degree. He planned to achieve American degree to find the English teaching job in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'He can complete his courses with the distant learning without going to the America.' It should be 'He can complete his courses with distant learning without going to America.'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the detail that the protagonist wants to achieve a master's degree, not a doctorate degree.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the detail that the protagonist wants to teach English in Taiwan after obtaining the degree.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what is his relationship between the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school. In that cram school, they have arranged the teachers to partner with each other. And the person is his partner.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have adultery?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'adultery' which is a more severe term than the original meaning of '怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？' which means 'How do you know they are having an affair?'

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
In the beginning, I just found that my husband will always work late in school. I asked it is just an cram school, why do you work so late? He told that he had to partner with the Chinese teacher, and there are so many things to discuss. In the beginning, I didn’t doubt him. However, I found that he will get some phone calls after work. After he got the phone call, he will not talk in front of me; instead, he will go to the study room. I started to doubt him, so I checked his cell phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So what did you see in his cell phone that is innormal
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'not' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjective 'innormal' after the noun 'cell phone', instead of before it.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone call history, there is a fixed number. So I was curious that I checked his messages. After checking, he has sent a message to a woman almost every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the phone number and the frequency of the messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Is there any wrong to send message? Is it because the message is not so appropriate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If the message is so ordinary, then it will be fine. But he was a person who got married, how can he send the intimate messages? I provided the message contents to the court. I think they are all in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的簡訊' as 'ordinary message' instead of 'ordinary text message'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '已婚的人' as 'a person who got married' instead of 'a married person'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing the message contents to the court.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the mention of the messages being in the file.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please check the page 13 on the file 1. The defendant, there are some message contents, please check this. Are these messages the contents in your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
沒錯
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I want to ask you some questions according to these contents. The first message is sent in the number of 0958932… at 9:50 pm November 31st 2012. The content is “I really miss you, my love” What’s the meaning?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
嗯…那是我同是寄的啊！我記得那時候我請了2天的假。她感到有點擔心。這就是為甚麼她寄給我這種簡訊。我同事在美國讀過書，所以她非常的開放。那就是她說話的方式啊！為甚麼她說”love”這個字呢? 這就是我們稱呼彼此的方法啊！
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of 'my love'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that the message sender because he once studied in America so she is open minded? And she is also open minded in emotion expression, so the word “my love” do not have any special meaning?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
沒有啊，在朋友之間這是非常平常的表達方法
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural meaning of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the sentence she mentioned?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence mentioned by the speaker.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的啊，她非常擔心我，我們是工作上的夥伴啊！當我請了2天假，她非常想念我啊！
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我說的啊，她非常擔心我，我們是工作上的夥伴啊！'
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the information that the speaker was away for two days. The correct translation should include '我請了2天假'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The translation leaves out the context that the speaker's absence caused the other person to miss them. The correct translation should include '當我請了2天假，她非常想念我'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean because you took two days off so the woman sends this message to you? Without your assistance, so she missed you? Is that…?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misinterpreted the original text and changed the meaning of the message.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，這就是內容啊！那簡訊根本就沒什麼
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical detail that the message was no big deal.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
OK, and the second message is sent in the same number at 11:55 pm January 13th 2013. The content is “I want you by my side, when can we be together?” So what does this message mean?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
null

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean the woman sent you the message just to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太跟庭上說的啊，我正在上碩士的課。在這個課程，我必須修滿30學分我才能得到學位。而我也需要完成一些作業和練習。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain that what is your major in your master degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Can' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'that' after the verb 'explain', which is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的主要課程是英語教學。在那個課程中，有些是有關英語教學的，有些則是有關文化和語言能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So what you learn is English teaching, but there are some cultural courses in this program?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少三門課是跟文化和溝通有關。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of courses.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '記得' (remember) instead of '說到' (mention) which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what’s the assignment that this course will require?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這文化溝通課程的作業會依每個學生而不一樣。以我自己為例，我來台灣是為了想要找到教學的工作，為了達成這個目標並表達我有足夠的能力，我必須擁有足夠的中文。所以很多作業都是有關中英翻譯。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean you want to teach Chinese in Taiwan, so in this program of master degree you have to prove your have competence of Chinese. And you have to finish assignment in this course, and some of the assignment is about English and Chinese translation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific assignments in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence structure should be 'You mean you want to teach Chinese in Taiwan, so you have to prove your competence in Chinese in this master's degree program. And you have to complete assignments in this course, some of which involve translating between English and Chinese.'

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，而且我還被要求要訓練我的口說和寫作能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s move back to the message we mentioned before. Is that your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是啊，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這個中文句子，我不知道要怎麼翻譯。你也知道有些中文字對外國人來說非常難。我需要一些幫助，所以我就請我的同事幫忙。我請她幫我翻譯這個句子然後再傳簡訊給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the part 'sent me the answer'
minor categories of grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing period at the end of the sentence

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean you sent the Chinese sentence to your co-worker and she translated it into English and sent back to you, is that right? So the message is the answer to your assignment?

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，這封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the homework assignment.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now let’s take a look at page 14-16 on file 1. Please take a look at it. Are all those messages sent by your co-worker just because you want to do your homework?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是啊，這些簡訊全都是為了要完成我的作業才傳的
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
And what’s your explanation about that your wife suspected you have adultery with your co-worker Cai Yan Wang?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's suspicion in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user rearranged the word order in the translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'suspected' instead of 'accused' in the translation.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我覺得我太太想太多了。我知道她對我無法扶養這個家庭感到不滿意。我希望法庭知道我開始上課時我太太都不支持我。她不願意幫助我得到這個學位。如果她能多一點支持我的話，我就不會請我同事幫忙了。我覺得她該為這個誤會負責。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'from the very beginning of my study' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我覺得' (I think) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'blamed' as '負責' (responsible) instead of '指責' (blamed).

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, it seems that you do not interact with your wife so happily?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚時我們關係還算好。但問題就是我的工作問題。我想要在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是工作時數一直不穩定。所以工作問題就變成我們2個之間關係的問題了。我們常常為了這個問題吵架，她不相信我已經盡力了，我也無法讓她了解我是多麼的無力還有我面臨的…
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
OK, let’s move back to the master program you mentioned. When did your master degree program started? Did you finish it? Did you get the degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question about when the master degree program ended.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question about whether the user got the degree or not.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這個碩士課程從2010年春季開始。它是2年的課程。這個課程應該在12月22日就完成了。我沒有完成這個課程因為我有兼一些工作，所以沒時間做功課。就像我說的，我太太都不支持我，我覺得我都是孤軍奮鬥在完成那個課程的。我覺得非常疲累也非常無力。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	incorrect translation of 'December 2012'
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	lack of cultural adaptation

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean the program is two-year but you didn’t finish it, why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我無法完成所有課程的要求
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'couldn't' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '無法' (unable) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When your registered semester end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個註冊學期是2012年…
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'fall' which is a critical detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a period at the end of the sentence.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So according to what you said, that your program will end on December 5th 2012, then after that you won’t have any assignment. However, after your program ended, the message between you and your co-worker is still keep going, then why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒完成那個學位並不代表我不想再增進我的語言能力。雖然課程結束了，但是我還是想要學中文
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that although you failed your master degree program, you still want to improve your Chinese competence, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
沒錯，這就是為甚麼我要請我的同事幫忙。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' from the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the role your co-worker plays is a little like your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是家教，她也是我真正的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Do you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
我有說要付錢給她，但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有說要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why she bothered to send you the message to help you to learn Chinese in the mid-night? Is this behavior just beyond the co-worker’s behavior?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original meaning
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	ignoring cultural norms

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我說的，她是非常支持我的朋友，她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是非常支持我的朋友'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the phrase 'learn Chinese'. The correct translation should be '她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order of the sentence.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那邊工作
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
So the co-worker Cai Yan Wang is also working there now?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她還在那邊工作啊，但我們不再是一起教書的夥伴了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們不再是一起教書的夥伴了' instead of '但我們不再是一起教書的夥伴了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any evidence or witness that you want to subpoena?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' before the noun 'witness', which is incorrect in English.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena the defendant’s co-worker, which is Cai Wan Wang, working in the Bo Yuan cram school. I hope her to explain the relationship between the defendant and her and the purpose of those messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical detail of the witness being subpoenaed.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'hope' before the object 'to subpoena', resulting in incorrect word order.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The plaintiff, do you have any evidence that you want to investigate for you?

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has take some action about the relationship between my husband and his co-worker. And they tried to persuade to quit the job. I hope that the court can confirm this from the cram school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence you hope the court to investigate? Now the situation is that your master program has finished on December 5th 2012. There is no reason you send the message between you and your co-worker just to finish your assignment. Especially that the messages between your co-worker and you are after 9 pm, it’s a little suspectful. Do you have any evidence that will help you with your case?

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我目前想不到任何證據可以請法院幫我調查的。就像我說的，我跟我同事對話目的都沒什麼。我只是想要增進我的語言能力和學中文

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re here to day for the adultery case. The plaintiff Yu-Hua Chen filed the case. Because her husband John Anderson has developed intimate encounter with his colleague in cram school. The plaintiff has discovered some intimate message in her husband’s cell phone. Also, the plaintiff’s husband constantly make up reasons for extending his shift and have tele-conferencing with his co-worker 王彩燕. The evidence gathered by the plaintiff has shown that her husband and 王彩華has go beyond co-worker’s relationship, therefore consisted this lawsuit. Defendant, you wife suspects that you’re having an affair, what do you say about that?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, I want to ask the plaintiff, how long have you and your husband been married?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years and we have no children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or outside Taiwan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan. Four years ago when he first came to Taiwan, he came to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker being the one who wants to learn Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the pass few years, has he been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
He was a Portuguese Teacher when we first met. And after we got married, he still teaches Portuguese. But Portuguese is not that much a popular language, so his working hours are unstable. Sometimes there are even periods between jobs in months. In this sense, he wanted to have a more stable job, so he started teaching English. As English is not his mother tongue, he decided to seek an advance degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You said about seeking a more advance degree. Do you mean he intended to study in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of studying for a degree.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seeking a more advance degree' instead of 'studying for a degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
He wants to teach in Taiwan, so the degree he’s seeking must be related to TESOL. He found a distance learning program of the University of California on the internet. So he doesn’t have to be in the States to get the degree, instead he could get the degree by distant learning. So he can manage to get the degree after he finished all the credits. His plan is that to get the degree licensed by the United states, he could get an English teaching job here in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what exactly is the relationship between your husband and his mistress in this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They’re partners and co-workers in cram school. So in the cram school, they have a policy to partner the foreign teacher with the local teacher.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the female teacher being the local teacher in the original text.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
Then you do you know they’re having an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, the only thing I found was that my husband was lengthening his shift. I asked him isn’t it just a cram school, what’s there to be lengthening your working hours? What he told me was that, since he has to partner with the local teacher therefore he needs more time to practice. I did not doubt him at first. Then after a while, he had been picking up phone calls after his work shifts. And after he picked up the phone, he wouldn’t talk in frond of me, instead he talked in the study room. This made me very suspicious, so I checked his phonebook.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything unusual in his phonebook?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of 'phonebook' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'unusual' and 'find' in their translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I found a constantly dialed number. Being very curious, I also checked his text message. And this was when I discovered that he was contacting this mistress.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the person being contacted.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '女的' as 'mistress' instead of 'a woman'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Well, after all it’s just text message, is there anything that’s inappropriate?
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural nuances of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it was just very simple text message, I wouldn’t go for it. But he’s a married man, how could he let a woman send him some intimate messages? I have provided some evidence for the court, I think they are in the case files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了' as 'If it was just very simple text message, I wouldn’t go for it.' The correct translation should be 'If it was just ordinary text messages, then it would be fine.' The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢?' as 'how could he let a woman send him some intimate messages?' The correct translation should be 'how could he let the other person send such intimate words?' The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of providing evidence to the court and the existence of case files, which are important details in the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see the evidence file 1. Here are several text message content, defendant please take a look. Are these text messages sent from your phone?

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'evidence file' instead of 'text messages'

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對 這確實是我手機裡的手機內容
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '內容' (content) which is not present in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I’m going to ask you a few questions based on these text messages. The first text message was sent at nine fifty PM on the 31st of November 2013 from the cellphone 0958-932***. The content was內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of the content is incorrect.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這只是我同事傳給我的啦, 我記得那時候我剛好修了兩天假, 他大概有點擔心吧所以他才傳這封簡訊, 我的同事是在美國接受教育地所以他的思想非常開放, 那就是他表達的方式啊, 至於說 噢 我的愛  那只是對關心的人表達的一種方式
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	adding unnecessary information
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So you mean your colleague is more westernized because she studied in the United States. And she’s more open minded in terms of emotions.So the content my love doesn’t have any special meaning right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the meaning of '我的愛' and fails to understand its cultural significance.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然不是啊, 這在好朋友和老朋友之間是很正常的表達方式
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation does not capture this meaning.

那她前面那句呢？
How about her previous sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
如我所說, 她只是擔心我而已, 我們就是工作的同事/夥伴, 當我請了兩天假, 她很自然而然的想念我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean she sent you this text message just because you didn’t come to work for two days? Without your assistance she missed you? Is that it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊  最主要就是這樣, 這封簡訊的內容就單純只是這樣而已
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the details of the original text, which states that the message was 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
So the second text message was sent at 23:55, 13th of January 2013 from the same cellphone 0958, is that right? 內容是我真的好想你, 希望你真的能陪在我身邊, What do you mean by that? Can you elaborate?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'I want you by my side' as '我真的好想你', which means 'I really miss you', instead of '我希望你真的能陪在我身邊', which means 'I hope you can really be by my side'.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她這麼發訊息只是告訴我我的中文作業理該怎麼表達
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You’re saying that she sent you this message so as to help you huh?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
當我太太像法院提出告訴, 我正在休息我的碩士學位, 要取得那個學位我必須先完成30個學分, 我自然而然需要完成一些作業和課業
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what exactly are you studying in your master profra

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位是英語教學碩士學位, 這學位的內容有部分是英語教學, 那其他部分還包含文化課程和語言能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the specific courses mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation does not mention that the program is TESOL.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation does not mention that the courses are part of the program.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you’re getting a degree in TESOL, and there are cross cultural communication courses in this program right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對 我記得至少有三門課是跟文化還有溝通有關
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of courses in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '至少有三門課' (at least three courses) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb '是' (were).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '跟' (with) instead of '和' (and) to express the relationship between culture and communication.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what kind of assignments do they give you in the cultural communication courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'they' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'you' before the verb 'give' instead of after.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
文化溝通的作業會因學生而異, 就我自己來舉例, 我在台灣試圖尋求英語教學的工作機會, 為了達到這個目標, 我必須證明我有中文能力, 所以我的一些作業內容就會包含中英翻譯
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '的作業會因學生而異' (assignments can be different for every student)

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean because you’re planning to teach in Taiwan so you have to show that you have some Chinese competence right? As a result you have to complete some Chinese courses, and in these courses, there are Chinese-english translation right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of completing assignments as part of the Chinese courses.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'are' before the subject 'you' in the sentence.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
當然, 我也被要求要加強我的口說和寫作能力
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'required' in the translation.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok, back to the beginning, this is your assignment right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對 我記得這個句子, 當我得到這個句子時 我並不知道他的英文怎麼說, 妳也知道有些中文字對外國人來說真的非常難以辨認, 我需要一些協助所以才跟我同是協助, 我叫他幫我翻譯這個句子然後再用訊息傳給我
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of asking colleague for help
minor categories of grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean because you asked your colleague about the sentence in Chinese so that’s why she sent it to you in English? So the message was simply an answer for the assignment right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對  那只是作業的答案
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
So now, we’ll see page 14 and 16 in the invest gory file, please check the content. So the colleague sent you these messages because you have problem finishing your assignments.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對  所有訊息的目的都一樣是幫助我完成功課

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So upon your wife’s lawsuit against your colleague 王彩文 what do you say about that?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the extramarital affair in the translation.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我覺得我太太真的想太多了, 我知道她對於我負擔家計的能力感到不滿足, 我希望庭上能了解她對我的學習從來沒有任何支持, 她根本不想幫助我完成我的學業, 她如果能支持我我根本不會找我的同事來幫助我我覺得這些誤會應該怪我太太

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, there seems to be some quarrels between you and your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of mentioning 'unpleasant situations', the user translates it as 'quarrels'.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們新婚的時候我們確實有一些美好時光, 但工作就是一個大問題, 我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文但我的時數不夠, 所以工作就變成我們爭吵的課題我們三不五時就為這吵架, 她不認為我有努力的付出, 所以她完成無法了解我辛苦的付出

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok, back to the master program we talked about. When did you start your master program? Did you get the degree and are you done with it?

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年的春天開始這個課程, 這是兩年的課程, 我原本應該在2012年的12月完成學位, 可是因為工作忙碌的關係, 我並沒有足夠的時間來完成學位要求的一些作業, 就像我說的我太太一直都不支持我, 我覺得我好像自己一個人在為這個學位努力, 我既疲累又身心俱疲.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So the duration of this program is two years, but you didn’t finish it, why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我無法達成學位所有要求的課程
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'finish' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when was the last registration of this semester?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋天
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the word '的' (meaning 'of') which is not present in the original text.
minor categories of grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a period at the end of the sentence.
minor categories of semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '秋天' (meaning 'autumn') instead of 'fall', which is the appropriate translation in this context.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said about the last registration, it ends on the fifth of December 2012, so after that, you shouldn’t have anything to do with the program right? But the text message between you and your colleague continued six months after your program, and why’s that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我沒有拿到學位, 我也想增進我的中文能力啊, 就算沒拿到學位我也想增進我的中文能力, 所以我精益求精的學中文
omission or addition	repetition of phrases	repetition of the phrase '我也想增進我的中文能力'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean even if you didn’t get the degree, you still want to continue to practice your Chinese, is that true?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對  所以我才求助於我的同事
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of asking for help from a colleague.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague is like your tutor huh?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'private tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是個家教而已, 她是個真正的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
不, 我想要付她錢, 但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想要付她錢' instead of '我想要她付錢'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
So if you didn’t pay her, why did she continue to send you these text messages even in sleeping hours? Don’t you think that your relationship was beyond coworkers?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
如我所說她是非常挺我的朋友, 她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是非常挺我的朋友' instead of '如我所說她是非常挺我的朋友'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '挺' in the translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'supportive'. A more appropriate word choice would be '支持' or '幫助'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach in the same cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'English' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
對, 我還在那工作
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
And your colleague王彩燕, does she still work in the same cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cram school' in the translation.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那裏工作, 但我們已經不一起搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們已經不一起搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經不一起搭檔了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Is there any other evidence or witness? Prosecutor?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'Prosecutor' at the end of the sentence instead of at the beginning.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena the defendant’s colleague to the court to witness for this case. So she can clarify about her relationship with the defendant and her purpose of sending those messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague's name, which is important for clarity.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'to the court' in the wrong position in the sentence.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Is there any other evidence that the plaintiff wish the court to investigate?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school took actions for the relationship of my husband and 王彩燕. The cram school even tried to persuade 王彩燕 to quit the job. Is it possible to ask the cram school whether this is true or not?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	incorrect translation of 王彩燕

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence that could help you?Well, the point is your master program should have end on the 5th of December 2012. There’s no reason to keep contact with 王彩燕 because of the assignment right? Especially, you two usually send text message after 9 PM and that’s a little bit weird. Do you have any evidence that could help you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the year in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'the 5th of December 2012' after 'your master program should have ended', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of '101年12月05日' being the end date of the master program.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of '王彩燕' being the person the defendant is in contact with.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the suspicious timing of the text messages being after 9 PM.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我不認為庭上有任何能幫助我的證據, 如我所說, 我和我同事連絡的目的非常簡單, 只是想提升我的語言能力繼續進修中文

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
Ok, we will have our witness on the ninth of June 2014 for the witness procedure. Plaintiff and defendant, both of you have to show up on that date. If necessary, you can hire an attorney, do you understand?

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The plaintiff, Ms. 陳玉華 filed the case. The reason is that her husband John Anderson has intimate relationship with his colleague. Besides, the plaintiff found that there are some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. Plus, the defendant has often made up reasons for working overtime or chatting with his colleague, Ms. 王彩燕, in the middle of the night via tele-conferencing or other ways. The contents of the messages collected by the plaintiff are considered beyond co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, simply speaking, your wife doubts that you have an affair and accused you of adultery. What’s your plea?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the major purpose is to ask about the details of phone records between the defendant and his colleague.The purpose is to clarity whether the defendant truly has an affair with his colleague and constitute adultery. Do both parties understand the procedure?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, I will ask the plaintiff some questions. How long have you been married to your husband? Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years, and we don't have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry your husband abroad or in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'you' in the translation.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and mainly wanted to teach Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
For past few years, is hid job here to teach Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he had kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hours were unstable. Sometimes, there would be a period of one or two months between two teaching courses. Later on, to make his income more stable, he wanted to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean that he would like to pursue a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating '進修' as 'seeking an advanced degree'

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to receive a degree of TESOL. He found a distance learning program offered by California in the United States online. Therefore, he could complete the course requirements by the means of online learning without going to the United States in person. After receiving all the credits, he could receive a master degree. His plan is that with such a degree offered by the United States, he can find a position as an English teacher in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
The cram school partner a foreign teacher with a Chinese teacher for teaching, and that woman is his teaching partner.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know your husband has an affair with his colleague?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the husband's colleague.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Do you find anything unusual in his cellphone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a question mark at the end of the sentence.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I often saw a certain set of numbers in the records of his phone book, so I checked his messages out of curiosity. Then I found that he has texted with a woman almost every single day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the phone number and the content of the messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Is it actually all right with texting messages, right? Is the content very inappropriate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they are common messages, it is fine. However, he is married. How could that woman always send him some intimate sentences? Earlier on, I have provided the court with some contents of their messages. They should be in the file.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please show the file one, page 13. There are some contents of several messages. The defendant, please verify whether the messages are from your cellphone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，這些是我手機裡的簡訊。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
 I have some questions for you based on these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50 at night on November 31st in 2012 from the number 0958932 and so on. The content said that “I really miss you, my love.”What does that mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這的確是我同事傳的簡訊。她只是關心我、擔心我，所以發簡訊給我。我同事在美國受教育的，她思想很西化，這就是她說話、表達情感的方式。至於「我的愛」一詞，這只是對我們關心的人的稱呼而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You said that the sender was educated abroad, so her thoughts are quite westernised, and the way she expresses herself is more open, so the word “my love”does not carry any special meaning, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its cultural connotations.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對，這只是一種普遍稱呼好朋友和關心的人的方式而已。
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	misinterpreting cultural context

那她前面那句呢？
And the sentence in front?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
像我說的，她只是關心我，我們是工作夥伴。當我休假兩天的時候，她當然會想我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '像我說的' (As I said) instead of '我說的像' (I said as).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'worried about' is not accurately translated as '只是關心' (just concerned). '擔心' (worried) would be a more appropriate translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the information that they are partners at work.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The translation leaves out the context that the speaker was away for two days.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that because you were off for two days, she sent you such a message, and because without your assistance in the courses, she missed you so much? Is that it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
這就是簡訊內容，並沒有什麼特別的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
And the second message was sent at 11:55 at night on January 13th, 2013 via the same phone number. The content was that “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?”What does that mean? Why did the sender text you such a message?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她只是告訴我作業中的一句中文怎麼寫而已。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Do you mean that she sent you this message only for helping you complete your assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
像我太太剛剛告訴法院的，我在修一個碩士課程。課程中，我必須完成三十個學分才能拿到學位。我當然必須完成一些作業和習題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
 Could you elaborate    what you exactly study for your master’s degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我修的是英語教學，有些課和英語教學有關，有些跟文化和語言能力有關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the specific mention of courses.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of some courses being related to culture and language competence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation uses '修' which means 'to repair' instead of '修的' which means 'to study/take'.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you study a master program on TESOL, and some courses are related to culture communications, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'some' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'study' before the subject 'you' in the translation, which is incorrect.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少有三門課和文化溝通有關
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of courses in their translation.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What kind of assignments were be given by such courses of culture and communication?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通課程的作業因學生而異。以我自己為例。我住在台灣，想要找到教英文的工作。為了達成這個目標，並精進語文能力，我必須有好的中文能力。因此，我有很多作業跟中英翻譯有關。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb phrase '因學生而異' (vary depending on the student) at the beginning of the sentence, which is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'reach this goal' as '達成這個目標' (achieve this goal) instead of '達到這個目標' (reach this goal).
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate 'culture and communication courses' and 'Chinese-English sentence translation'.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Do you mean that because you planned to teach English in Taiwan, this program requires you to prove you have a certain level of Chinese ability? And therefore, you have to complete some assignments give by the courses, which is sentence translation? Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of assignments being given by the courses.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'give' before the subject 'courses', resulting in incorrect word order.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對的，我當然必須精進我的口說和寫作能力。

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
All right, let’s go back to that sentence. You said that was your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我記得這個句子。我剛開始不知道那些中文句子用英文該怎麼說。有些中文字對外國人來說很難認。我需要一些協助，所以請同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯句子，用簡訊傳給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of how they asked their colleague for help.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '請' (ask) after the object '她' (her), which is incorrect in English.
grammar and structure	preposition errors	The user used the preposition '用' (with) instead of '為' (for) when expressing the purpose of asking for help.
cultural transformation	misunderstanding historical or social context	The user mentioned using a text message to communicate, which may not be the most common method of communication in all cultures.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Do you mean that you asked your colleague how to say that sentence in Chinese, and she texted you the answer? Is that the scenario? In other words, the content of the message is only the answer to the assignment, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text by not including the specific sentence in Chinese that the colleague provided the answer for.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
簡訊內容就是我的作業答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the message being a text message.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then please show the contents of all the messages on page 14 to page 16 in the file one. Please verify the messages. Is it because that you has to do your assignments and ask for help from your colleague, asking her to send you messages?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，所有簡訊都是為了幫助我完成作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Your wife just said that you have an affair with your colleague, 王彩燕, what is your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's accusation in the translation.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了！我想她只是不滿意我賺錢的能力。我想告訴庭上，我太太從一開始就完全不支持我念碩士，她並不願意幫助我完成學業。如果她願意支持我一點點，我不會請同事幫忙。我覺得她自己應該為這誤解負責。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the wife is only dissatisfied with the husband's ability to earn money, while the original text mentions the wife's dissatisfaction with the husband's ability to support the family, which includes more than just financial support.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the sentence '我想告訴庭上', where the subject '我' (I) should come before the verb '想告訴' (want to tell).
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the detail that the husband asked his colleague for help, which is mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation leaves out the critical context that the husband is blaming the wife for the misunderstanding, which is mentioned in the original text.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your saying, there are some unpleasant situations between you and your wife?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚的時候，我們的確渡過了一段美好時光，但是問題出在我的工作。我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是授課時數很不穩定，所以我的工作就成了我們之間的問題。我們常常為這個問題吵架。她不相信我已經盡力了，我也無法讓她理解我遇到的挫折和困難。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'good time' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '的時候' (at the time) after '剛結婚' (just married), which changes the meaning of the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'employment' as '工作' (work) instead of '就業' (employment).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'teaching Portuguese' as '教葡萄牙文' (teaching Portuguese language) instead of '教授葡萄牙語' (teaching the Portuguese language).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '的問題' (the problem) after '我們之間' (between us), which changes the meaning of the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'fought' as '吵架' (quarreled) instead of '爭吵' (argued).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'frustration' as '挫折' (setback) instead of '沮喪' (frustration).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'difficult situation' as '困難' (difficulty) instead of '困境' (difficult situation).

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Well, let’s go back to the master program, which you just talked about. When did you start your program, and does it end? Did you receive the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我的碩士課程從2010年春天開始，是兩年的課程，應該要在2012年12月完成課程。但是我沒有完成課程，因為我有兼差，沒有時間完成我的課程作業。像我說的，我太太並不支持我。我覺得是自己一路單獨奮鬥，感覺很累、很有挫折。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of 'supportive'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misinterpretation of 'supportive'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
Do you mean that the program should have lasted for two years, but you did not complete it, and why?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not completing the program.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我無法完成所有的課程要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'couldn't' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
What did it end, the last semester that you registered?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是在2012年秋季。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If as you said, your last semester ended on December 5th in 2012, based on reasonable doubts, you would have no assignments after that, right? How would you continue sending messages with your colleagues even until six months after the program was ended?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'reasonable doubts' instead of 'reasonable inference'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting historical or social context	misunderstanding the context of the conversation

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我也許無法完成課程，但不代表我不想精進語言能力。即使我不能完成課程，我還是很想加強我的中文能力，所以我繼續自我學習。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Do you mean that even though  you failed to complete the master program, you still want to sharpen your Chinese ability and make your Chinese more fluent, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
是，我請同事幫忙。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '請' (ask) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So that colleague plays a role as a tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅是個家教，也是我真正的好友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Have you offered her any pay?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Have you paid her any money?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我想要付她錢，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我想要付她錢' instead of '我想要她付錢'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you had not paid her, why would she like to send you messages to answer your questions even in the middle of the night, when she should go to bed for sleep?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
因此我認為她是非常支持我的，她用自己的時間幫助我學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因此我認為她是非常支持我的'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work as an English teacher at that cram school now?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'work' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'still' in the wrong position in their translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那裡工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is that colleague, 王彩燕, still working there, too?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out the word 'also'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the question

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那裡工作，但我們不再是工作夥伴了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'team up' which is a critical detail in the original text.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any further evidence to be investigated or people to be subpoenaed?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
We would like to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, 王彩燕, as a witness to the court to elaborate her relationship with the defendant and the background as well as the purpose of writing these messages?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague's workplace, which is important for context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'as a witness to the court' in an awkward position in the sentence.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The plaintiff, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I have heard that the cram school has taken some actions because of their relationship. The cram school even tried to persuade Ms. 王彩燕 to leave the job position. I am wandering whether we can verify these facts with the cram school.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'queen' before '彩燕' in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context that the actions were taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the word 'Ms.' before '王彩燕' which was not present in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? The current situation is that your master program was ended on December 5th, 2012, and there are no reasons for you to take completing assignments as an excuse to explain the interaction of texting messages between you and 王彩燕, especially your interactions were mostly after 9 o’clock at night. This behaviour causes doubts. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing comma
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong translation of '希望法庭為你調查的事證'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong translation of '案情'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我無法想到有任何證據是法院可以代表我調查的。如我所說，我和同事間的溝通很簡單。我只是想要精進中文能力，繼續學習中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court date is set at 4:30 in the afternoon on June 9th, 2014 for asking the witness. The plaintiff and the defendant, please do  come on that day. If necessary, the both parties have the right to hire lawyers. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我明白。
 I understand.

I understand.
我明白。

今天庭期到此結束。
Today’s court ends here.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word '期' which means 'session' or 'hearing'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'court' before 'today's' instead of after.

今為偵字1415號 妨害名譽案件之準備程序

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'about' before 'your right and your obligation'.

1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
You have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
The prosecutor, please state the crime.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the crime.

如起訴書所載。
As stated in the indictment.

被告因妨害名譽案件被檢察官起訴，起因是被告涉嫌在中華民國108年12月1日到109年1月20日之間，在網際網路論壇，名為Foreign Land (外國園地)，發表一連串的評論，雖此論壇之主要目的是提供在台居留外國人士交流之平台，但被告卻利用這樣一個平台進行對告訴人公司之批評，致使告訴人公司名譽受損。對此妨害名譽之告訴，有何辯解？
This incident happened on December 1, 2019 to January 20, 2020. The accused post the comments on the internet chat forum, Foreign Land, which provides foreigners in Taiwan to communicate with others. However, the accused used this platform to criticize the accuser’s company, which damaged the accuser’s company reputation, so the accused was prosecuted. What’s your plea?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific charge of defamation in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the fact that the accused is the defendant in the case.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time frame at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'chat forum' instead of 'internet forum' in the translation.

I plead not guilty.
我沒有罪。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. '我沒有罪' translates to 'I am not guilty' instead of 'I plead not guilty.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user's translation lacks the punctuation mark at the end of the sentence. It should be '我沒有罪。' to indicate a complete sentence.

請問你知道「外國園地」這個論壇嗎？
The defendant, do you know the Internet forum, Foreign Land
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific name of the forum, 'Foreign Land'.

Yes, Foreign Land is a forum very popular among foreigners.
我知道這個Foreign Land非常受歡迎，尤其是在外國人當中。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

可以簡要的描述你在這個平台上的活動嗎？
Can you summarize your activities on Foreign Land?

I am a registered member, which means I can read others’ posts and post articles for others to read.
我是有註冊的會員，我可以看到別人發表的文章，同時也可以發表自己的文章給別人看。

你常常在上面發表文章嗎，可以大概抓個頻率嗎，大概多久發表一篇文章？
How often you post comments on the Foreign Land? ...
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'comments' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'comments' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'post'.

I won’t say I regularly post articles on Foreign Land. I only have postings when I want to share some concerns or vent my feelings.
我不會說我常常在上面發文，我只有在我有一些疑慮，還有想要發洩一些情緒的時候才會在上面發文。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

提示偵券(一)65頁。這一頁是取自中華民國108年12月13日在「外國園地」中發表的內容。請你看一下，這是你寫的嗎？
… The page is about your comments on Foreign Land on December 13, 2019. Please take a look. Are these your posts?

It seems to be my posting but it was posted some time ago, I am not sure if the article is in its entirety.
我有發表這個文章，但是是在很久之前發表的，所以我不確定文章的完整性。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about the article being posted some time ago.

As you can see from the copy, I posted some concerns and questions regarding Winwin company, especially about how foreigners were treated by that company.
…我在上面發表了我的疑慮、對公司的一些問題，還有他們怎麼對待外國員工。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the specific concerns and questions mentioned in the original text.

你剛剛講到的某一公司，請問有在任何一篇文章當中，明確指出該公司的全名嗎？
You mentioned the full name of the company. Did you point out its name in any comments?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the company's full name in the translation.

Yes, I am sure I have used the company’s full name, Winwin.
我確定我有在上面用公司的全名，贏贏。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你在65頁的內容中，提到該公司常常在雇用外國人時，沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利，更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況。請問，你這樣講，有證據嗎？
In Page 65, you mentioned this company hired foreign employee without following Labor Basic Law about work time, basic wage and benefits. The company didn’t help foreigners apply for working visa. For this, do you have any evidence?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the company's frequent violation of labor laws and failure to provide basic working hours, wages, and benefits to foreign employees.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the company's failure to assist foreign employees in applying for work visas.

I did mention those issues. I did not have evidence. I heard those issues from some other foreign friends who either worked for that company or had experiences with that company. As a result, I expressed my concerns in the question format, meaning I asked all those questions regarding working hours, basic salary, benefits and ARC application with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions.
我有講過這個問題，但我沒有證據。我是從我一些在那個公司工作的朋友或是在那邊有經驗的朋友聽來的。我有在論壇發表一些問題，包含了工作時數、基本薪資、福利，還有是否幫員工申請居留簽證…。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of expressing concerns in the question format.

你的意思是說，你是從其他外國朋友那邊聽到這些細節，但不是本人的第一手資料，是嗎？
You mean that you heard from you friends, but it isn’t your first-hand information, right?

True. I heard those details from other friends, also the registered members of Foreign Land.
沒錯，我是從朋友還有一些註冊會員那邊聽到這些小細節的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'other friends' in the original text.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'registered members of Foreign Land' in the original text.

那你怎麼可以在一個公開的論壇中，直接把聽來的東西，就做了轉述呢？
How could you repost this information on Foreign Land?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misunderstood the cultural context of the original text.

I didn’t quote others and post the concerns as accusations. Instead, all my comments were questions. I was hoping Winwin would provide some sort of clarifications so that the foreign community would not hold any wrong ideas against that company.
我沒有直接引用，我只是發表言論、提出我的問題。我只是希望贏贏公司可以釐清這些問題，讓外國人不會對這家公司有誤解。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'posting concerns as accusations' in their translation.

什麼叫做你都是用問題的方式來進行批評？可以解釋一下嗎？
What do you mean that you criticize in questions? Can you explain it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

For example, I asked in one posting “Is it true that Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC, the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally?”.
舉例來說，我發表了一個問題，就是那個公司有沒有幫外國人申請居留證，外國人可以合法居留嗎?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of Winwin, the company mentioned in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order should be '外國人可以合法居留嗎?' instead of '外國人可以合法居留嗎?'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses the word '公司' (company) instead of 'Winwin', which is the specific company mentioned in the original text.

所以你發表這一系列文章的目的只是為了釐清所謂的「真相」，是嗎？
So, you posted a series of comments just in order to find out the truth?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '發表' as 'posted' instead of 'expressed'.

Yes, I only wanted to get some clarifications or explanations. However, instead of responding to my questions directly, Winwin chose to file this lawsuit against me.
是的，我只是想要得到一些澄清和解釋。然而，這個公司沒有直接回答我的問題，而是對我提出告訴。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the company's name in the translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'chose to file this lawsuit against me' as '對我提出告訴', which does not accurately convey the meaning of a lawsuit being filed against the user.

雖然告訴人有提供他們自外國園地抓下來文章內容，但他們也告訴檢方，這些內容並不完整。所以就你記憶所及，你大概連續發表了幾篇呢？
Although the accuser provided some comments from Foreign Land and told the police, but the content wasn’t entire. …
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific number of articles the speaker published.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'published' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'Foreign Land' as 'Foreign Land' instead of providing the actual name of the publication.

你的意思是說當這個訴訟開始進行的時候，那個論壇的版主就進行了刪文的動作嗎？
You mean when the lawsuit began, the administrator of the forum deleted all of your posts, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific forum where the posts were deleted.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'of the forum' after 'the administrator', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, that is correct.
是這樣沒錯。

也就是說，你完全沒有辦法確定你一共為此事件發表過幾篇文章？
That is, you can’t assure how many comments you posted, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That’s correct, too.
這樣也沒錯。

那就你記憶所及，你曾經接到過該公司任何希望你停止批評他們的要求嗎？你有照做嗎？
Did you remember that the company asked you to stop criticizing? Did you stop posting comments?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I think towards the end of my postings, I did get a request from Winwin, asking me to stop posting articles about their company. I didn’t stop immediately because, again, I was only asking questions.
我認為如果要我停止發文的話，我應該會收到一些叫我停止發文的請求，我沒有立即停止，因為就像我前面所說的，我只是問問題而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

所以你還是堅持，因為你都是用問題的方式來發表評論，並沒有直接毀謗該公司名譽的事實，是嗎？
So, you mean you insist on posting comments in question, but not libeling the company, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It was never my intention to defame Winwin. I don’t quite understand how a series of questions could possibly constitute “defamation.”
我從來都不是故意要毀謗這個公司，我不懂為什麼問問題會造成毀謗。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那請問告訴人，貴公司是什麼時候開始瞭解到，在「外國園地」當中，有關於貴公司的文章？
Now, I’m going to ask accuser some questions. Accuser, when do you realize that some comments are posted on Foreign Land about your company?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

This issue first came to our attention around December 2019. My wife and I personally were not active in that kind of forums. We were only informed by some friends about the malicious comments on Foreign Land until then.
我第一次知道此事是在2019年12月。我和我老婆在這樣的論壇並不活躍。我們是在那時才被朋友告知有這些惡意評論。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

對於剛剛被告表示他只是提出一連串的問題，希望貴公司回答這些問題，並沒有以陳述方式毀謗貴公司的名譽。你有何意見？
According to the accused, he just posted a series of questions and hoped that the company can respond to him. He didn’t say something directly to defame your company. Did you have any opinion?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical detail that the accused did not make any defamatory statements about the company.

That’s not true. In English, even when comments are made in the question format, they still carry enough force to make readers wonder or question the facts implied by the questions. Even when the defendant said he only asked questions, damage was done to my company.
這不是事實。在英文表達中，即使用問題方式評論，也能讓閱讀的人產生好奇或質疑事實。即使被告說他只是問問題，也足以毀謗我的公司。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'damage was done' is not accurately conveyed in the translation.

你的意思是說，不管對方是否用問題方式提出質疑，你們公司的名譽實際上都有所損害嗎？請解釋一下。
Do you meant that whether the other party posted the questions, the company has been defamed? Can you explain?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when the defendant asked those questions, it caused doubt and suspicion in the circle of foreigners in Taiwan. Foreigners form their own circle here in Taiwan and rumors travel fast. That’s why even the Labor Bureau paid several visits to our company, trying to find out if we were involved in the matters posted on Foreign Land.
是的。當被告問了這些問題，就能讓這些住在台灣的外國人懷疑這間公司。這些外國人在這個論壇裡自成一圈。在這圈子裡，謠言傳得非常快。這就是爲什麼勞工局多次造訪我的公司，來看這些評論中的問題是否真的存在。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

那勞工局前往貴公司瞭解外國人的雇用狀況，以及居留證的申請細節，有發現什麼不符合的地方嗎？
When the Labor Bureau went to the company to understand the situation of hiring the foreigner and their application of ARC, did anything happen which didn’t meet the requirements?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

No, the representatives from the Bureau came but did not find anything wrong with our company or our hiring practice.
沒有，勞工局派的代表並沒有查到任何不符規定的事。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the company and the hiring practice being investigated.

如果勞工局的調查並沒有發現什麼不妥之處，或是違法之處，再加上剛剛被告也解釋，他撰寫這些文章的目的都只是希望貴公司能夠進行自清的動作，有沒有可能雙方進行和解呢？
If the Labor Bureau didn’t find anything which is illegal or not appropriate, just like the accused explained that he wrote these articles only to hope that the company can clarify, can both parties consider settlement?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the Labor Bureau's investigation and the purpose of the accused's articles.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.

We previously tried but failed to reach any conclusion. I would only consider settling this case with two things from the defendant. First, he has to formally apologize to Winwin for posting those inappropriate comments on Foreign Land. Second, as he said he heard all those details from “other foreign friends,” he should provide the names of those people to clear his own name.
我們之前有試著調解，但失敗了。我可以考慮和解，但對被告有兩件事的要求。第一，他必須為他不妥言論，正式向我的公司道歉。第二，如他剛才所說他是從其他外國朋友中聽到這些消息，他必須提供這些朋友的全名
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using '我的公司' instead of 'Winwin'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating 'Foreign Land'

被告，就像剛剛告訴人所指出，如果要進行和解，他希望由你這邊採取兩個行動，第一，正式道歉，對於在外國園地所發表的文章，不論你的文章是否造成告訴人公司實質上的名譽受損，對方都希望你提出道歉。第二，你剛剛前面指出，你是從一些外國友人那邊，聽到告訴人公司有違法對待外國勞工之嫌，你可以提供這些友人的姓名嗎？
The accused, just like accuser said, if you want a settlement, you need to take two actions. First, you need to apologize formally. For the comments you posted on Foreign Land, whether they constituted defamation, you need to apologize. Second, you have mentioned that you heard these things from your foreign friend. The company treated the employees illegally. Can you provide the names of your friends?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation

No, I would not consider these terms. First of all, I don’t know why I should apologize for posting some questions on the Internet. Since when is asking questions a crime? Second, Winwin cannot agree to settle the case with the term of obtaining names from me. This is not right.
不，我拒絕接受這些條件。第一點，我不懂為什麼我要為這些言論道歉，什麼時候問問題也犯法？第二，他不應該要我公開這些外國朋友的全名。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of 'terms'

如果被告堅持因為文章的書寫內容都是以問題的方式進行，並沒有要毀謗告訴人公司的意圖，這顯然在第一個部分，你就是拒絕道歉，是嗎？
The accused, you insist that you wrote the comments in questions, and you didn’t intend to defame the company, so you won’t apologize, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I will not consider making an apology.
對，我拒絕道歉。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

對於告訴人的第二個要求，你也拒絕。是因為擔心告訴人公司會對那些人進行相關的法律訴訟，是嗎？
You also reject the second condition. Is that because you afraid that the company will file a lawsuit against your foreign friends?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the company in their translation.

The thing is that some of the friends used to or may be currently working for Winwin. How could I jeopardize them just for the sake of settling my own case? Why should they suffer the potential harm?
我擔心那些曾在那邊工作或是目前在那工作的朋友受害。我怎麼可以出賣這些朋友，就因為我想達成和解？為什麼他們要遭到這些傷害？
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using '出賣' instead of '危害'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misinterpreting the meaning of 'jeopardize'

如果雙方無法就和解進行任何退讓，那麼法院這邊只能將這一次的準備程序內容進行彙整，以便進行下一次的審理程序。雙方的辯護人，是不是能夠針對和解這個選擇，再跟你們的當事人談一談呢？
The accuser, if both parties cannot reach a settlement, the court will collect the details for preparatory procedure and have next trial procedure. Today both parties have their lawyers. The lawyers of both parties, can you negotiate with your clients about settlement?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'accuser' instead of 'both parties'
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	not addressing the court respectfully

報告庭上，其實之前我們就有跟被告溝通，既然他說他的消息都是聽自其他友人，他大可以直接把那些人的名字提供給我們，而讓這一次的訴訟事件告一段落，但被告的態度一直很不合作，所以我們這邊也就無法進行進一步的和解動作。
Dear judge, I am the lawyer of the accuser. We used to negotiate with the defendant. The defendant said he heard information from his friends. He can provide their full names, so this case will be dismissed here. However, the defendant didn’t want to cooperate so we couldn’t reach an agreement.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the previous communication between the parties.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'here' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'dismissed'.

報告鈞院，其實我的當事人會有這樣的顧慮，最主要是因為告訴人公司雇用很多外國人士，我的當事人不希望因為提供友人姓名一事，而讓過去或目前為告訴人公司服務的外國人士，惹上不必要的麻煩。望請鈞院了解。
Dear judge, I am the lawyer of the accused. The reason why my client has these concerns is because the accuser’s company applies many foreign employees. My client doesn’t want to provide the names of his foreign friends because he doesn’t want his friends to get into trouble. Hope you can understand.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the specific details of the accused's concerns, which are related to the accuser's company employing many foreign employees.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation fails to mention that the accused is concerned about providing the names of his foreign friends.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user's translation skips the sentence mentioning the accused's concern about his friends getting into trouble.

既然告訴人跟被告雙方對於和解都各自有堅持，本庭定中華民國109年8月14日上午11點整進行審理程序。
Because both parties don’t reach a settlement, so the date of the trial procedure will set at 11 a.m. on August 14, 2020.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

 請問被告，有無需要法院進一步調查之證據？
The defendant, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, your honor.
沒有，親愛的法官大人。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

那告訴人這邊呢？
The accuser, do you have any evidence you hope the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the crucial context of the original text.

I will think about it. If anything comes up, I will ask my lawyer to place a request to the court.
如果我有想到任何問題，我會請律師告知庭上。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'request' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '告知庭上' (inform the court) at the end of the sentence instead of after '請律師' (ask my lawyer).

那針對下一次的庭期，我們就不再發傳票，而是直接在庭直接以橘色小卡進行通知。請在簽完今天的筆錄後，領取小卡，再行離開。
About the next court date, we will not issue the subpoena. We will give you orange cards to inform you. Please sign your statement… The court is dismissed today.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the instruction to collect the orange card before leaving.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not use proper punctuation to separate the two sentences.

omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'details' in the original text.

如起訴書所載。
As stated in the indictment.

被告因妨害名譽案件被檢察官起訴，起因是被告涉嫌在中華民國108年12月1日到109年1月20日之間，在網際網路論壇，名為Foreign Land (外國園地)，發表一連串的評論，雖此論壇之主要目的是提供在台居留外國人士交流之平台，但被告卻利用這樣一個平台進行對告訴人公司之批評，致使告訴人公司名譽受損。對此妨害名譽之告訴，有何辯解？
The defendant, you are prosecuted for defamation. The reason is because during umm… December 1st, 2019 to January 20th, 2020, you posted a thread of comments on the social media on the Internet called Foreign Land. This platform’s intention is to let foreigners who live in Taiwan to communicate with each other, but you used this platform to criticize the accuser’s company, and defamed the company. And damaged the company’s reputation. As for the defamation crime, what’s your plea?
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted specific dates and duration of the alleged offense
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect placement of 'umm'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	used 'social media' instead of 'internet forum'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	translated 'Foreign Land' as 'Foreign Land' instead of 'Foreign Land (外國園地)'

I plead not guilty.
我沒有罪。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'I plead not guilty.'

請問你知道「外國園地」這個論壇嗎？
Defendant, do you know the internet platform Foreign Land?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'forum' in their translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '論壇' as 'internet platform' instead of 'forum'.

Yes, Foreign Land is a forum very popular among foreigners.
我知道，因為外國園地在外國人…在我們外國人之間是很受歡迎的論壇。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'Foreign Land' as '外國園地' which means 'foreign garden' instead of '外國人' which means 'foreigners'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在我們外國人之間' (among us foreigners) in the wrong position in the sentence.

可以簡要的描述你在這個平台上的活動嗎？
Can you briefly your activities on this platform?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'describe' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'briefly' after the subject 'you' instead of before it.

I am a registered member, which means I can read others’ posts and post articles for others to read.
我是有註冊的會員，就是我可以看別人的文章，我也可以發布文章讓其他人看。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你常常在上面發表文章嗎，可以大概抓個頻率嗎，大概多久發表一篇文章？
So, do you often post comments on this platform

I won’t say I regularly post articles on Foreign Land. I only have postings when I want to share some concerns or vent my feelings.
我不會說我常常在上面發文，我只有在..我只有在我關心的事情或我想要抒發情緒的時候才會發。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'Foreign Land' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我不會說' (I won't say) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '我只有在' (I only have).

提示偵券(一)65頁。這一頁是取自中華民國108年12月13日在「外國園地」中發表的內容。請你看一下，這是你寫的嗎？
Next, I am going to inform the investigatory paper number 1 page 65. This page is from the comments on Foreign Land December 13th, 2019. Is this the comments you posted?

It seems to be my posting but it was posted some time ago, I am not sure if the article is in its entirety.
這個看起來像是我發的，但是在很久以前，所以我也沒有辦法確定文章的完整度。

你在文中所提到的主要內容為何？請陳述。
Please state what you posted… the content of what you posted.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect placement of words
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong words

As you can see from the copy, I posted some concerns and questions regarding Winwin company, especially about how foreigners were treated by that company.
就像你所看到的一樣，我..我發表了 對於文文公司的問題，然後揭露外國人在這家公司是怎麼被對待的。

你剛剛講到的某一公司，請問有在任何一篇文章當中，明確指出該公司的全名嗎？
You have mentioned the company’s name. Do you remember if you have posted the full name of the company in any of your posts?

Yes, I am sure I have used the company’s full name, Winwin.
恩對阿，我有用公司的本名，文文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你在65頁的內容中，提到該公司常常在雇用外國人時，沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利，更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況。請問，你這樣講，有證據嗎？
As stated in page 65, you stated that this company when hiring foreigners, they didn’t follow the Basic Labor Law of paying basic wage, and the time and rights. And you also mentioned that the company didn’t apply for foreigner’s visa, is this true?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the company's failure to provide benefits.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the critical context of the company's failure to provide basic working hours.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the question of whether there is evidence for the mentioned situation.

I did mention those issues. I did not have evidence. I heard those issues from some other foreign friends who either worked for that company or had experiences with that company. As a result, I expressed my concerns in the question format, meaning I asked all those questions regarding working hours, basic salary, benefits and ARC application with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions.
我的確有聽到這些問題，但我沒有證據。我是從曾經在那家公司工作過的外國人那邊聽到這些消息的。因此我發表了我的意見…我用問的方式發表我的意見，其中提到了這個公司的基本工時、工資還有居留證的問題，希望文文公司可以….看到並且改善。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of expressing concerns in the question format.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention the specific issues they heard from their foreign friends.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention the hope for a response from Winwin.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not in correct English word order.

你的意思是說，你是從其他外國朋友那邊聽到這些細節，但不是本人的第一手資料，是嗎？
Do you mean that you heard this from foreigner friends and this information is not first hand?

True. I heard those details from other friends, also the registered members of Foreign Land.
沒錯，我是從朋友那邊聽來的，還有論壇上註冊的會員他們也這麼說。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那你怎麼可以在一個公開的論壇中，直接把聽來的東西，就做了轉述呢？
Then how can you… how can you post these comments on a public platform which is not first hand information?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the word order

I didn’t quote others and post the concerns as accusations. Instead, all my comments were questions. I was hoping Winwin would provide some sort of clarifications so that the foreign community would not hold any wrong ideas against that company.
我並沒有直接的….ㄟ…直接控告他所做的事情，我都用詢問的方式。我希望文文公司他們可以澄清這些不好的訊息，這樣子外國人也不會對他有不好的印象。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed in the translation.

什麼叫做你都是用問題的方式來進行批評？可以解釋一下嗎？
What do you mean by you criticized by asking questions? Can you explain this?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

For example, I asked in one posting “Is it true that Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC, the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally?”.
舉例來說，我說文文公司他沒有幫外國人申請居留證……也就是在台灣工作的……..
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of 'ARC'

所以你發表這一系列文章的目的只是為了釐清所謂的「真相」，是嗎？
So, the intention of you posting these comments is just to find out the truth?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '文章' as 'comments' instead of 'articles'.

Yes, I only wanted to get some clarifications or explanations. However, instead of responding to my questions directly, Winwin chose to file this lawsuit against me.
是的，我只是希望他可以澄清並且給大家一個交代。然而，文文公司不但沒有直接回答我的問題，反而是對我提起訴訟。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'file this lawsuit against me' is translated as '對我提起訴訟' which means 'file a lawsuit against me' but does not convey the idea of choosing to file a lawsuit instead of responding to the user's questions.

雖然告訴人有提供他們自外國園地抓下來文章內容，但他們也告訴檢方，這些內容並不完整。所以就你記憶所及，你大概連續發表了幾篇呢？
Although the accuser provided some comments from Foreign Land, they have said that these comments are not a whole. How many posts did you post on this platform?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '文章' as 'comments'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misinterpretation of '自外國園地' as 'Foreign Land'

As I stated before, it has been some time already. I cannot recall exactly how many articles I posted on Foreign Land, perhaps eight to ten? The problem is when this lawsuit began, the administrator of Foreign Land decided to delete my postings to avoid trouble.
 就像我說過的，我偶爾會發，但是我沒有辦法確切記得我到底發了幾篇，我想大概是在8~10篇的範圍內，問題是當文文公司提起訴訟的時候，外國園地的版主決定刪掉我寫的那些文章來避免麻煩。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of 'Foreign Land'

你的意思是說當這個訴訟開始進行的時候，那個論壇的版主就進行了刪文的動作嗎？
Do you mean after the lawsuit was filed, the administrator of Foreign Land just deleted all the posts?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the forum 'Foreign Land' in their translation.

Yes, that is correct.
沒有錯。

也就是說，你完全沒有辦法確定你一共為此事件發表過幾篇文章？
This also means that you cannot be sure that you posted… how many comments you posted about this incident, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'comments' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'comments' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'posted'.

That’s correct, too.
恩，你說的沒錯。

那就你記憶所及，你曾經接到過該公司任何希望你停止批評他們的要求嗎？你有照做嗎？
As far as you can remember, did the company tell you to stop your comments? And did you do so?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the company in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'tell' before the subject 'the company' instead of using the correct word order.

I think towards the end of my postings, I did get a request from Winwin, asking me to stop posting articles about their company. I didn’t stop immediately because, again, I was only asking questions.
沒錯，文文公司確實有要求我停止再發布這些文章，但我並沒有馬上停止這麼做，就像我說過的阿，我只是問問題而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

所以你還是堅持，因為你都是用問題的方式來發表評論，並沒有直接毀謗該公司名譽的事實，是嗎？
So, the defendant, you mean you only criticized the company by asking questions and do not admit that you libeled the company, right?

It was never my intention to defame Winwin. I don’t quite understand how a series of questions could possibly constitute “defamation.”
妨害文文公司的名譽從來不是我的目的，我真的不能理解這些我問的問題會構成妨害名譽
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那請問告訴人，貴公司是什麼時候開始瞭解到，在「外國園地」當中，有關於貴公司的文章？
Then I am going to ask the accuser some questions. So, the accuser, when do you realize that the accused post some articles on the Foreign Land about your company?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

This issue first came to our attention around December 2019. My wife and I personally were not active in that kind of forums. We were only informed by some friends about the malicious comments on Foreign Land until then.
這個事件，我們公司第一次注意到這件事是在2019年的12月。我和我的老婆並沒有在那個論壇裡面很活躍。我們當時是被朋友告知有這些惡意的言論在該論壇上。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'Foreign Land' in their translation, which is a critical detail in the original text.

對於剛剛被告表示他只是提出一連串的問題，希望貴公司回答這些問題，並沒有以陳述方式毀謗貴公司的名譽。你有何意見？
Just.. as what the accused mentioned, he said that he just… he just post the article by asking questions instead of statement… instead of…instead of post the article in the form of statement.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That’s not true. In English, even when comments are made in the question format, they still carry enough force to make readers wonder or question the facts implied by the questions. Even when the defendant said he only asked questions, damage was done to my company.
在英文裡面，即使是問問題的形式，文字也有足夠的力量可以讓閱讀的人覺得或懷疑那些事實。所以當被告說他用問問題的方式，也足以妨害我們公司的名譽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是說，不管對方是否用問題方式提出質疑，你們公司的名譽實際上都有所損害嗎？請解釋一下。
Do you mean that, no matter…whether the accused use the …use the …the accused use …asking question form. Your …still be damage….
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed in the translation.

Yes, when the defendant asked those questions, it caused doubt and suspicion in the circle of foreigners in Taiwan. Foreigners form their own circle here in Taiwan and rumors travel fast. That’s why even the Labor Bureau paid several visits to our company, trying to find out if we were involved in the matters posted on Foreign Land.
是的，當被告她提出這些疑問的時候就在我們外國人的圈子裡面造成非常大的懷疑和不信任。外國人在台灣有自己的圈子，然後在這個圈子裏面有很多流言和消息都傳得很快。這就是為什麼台灣的勞工局多次造訪我們，也想要知道我們是否有捲進這起事件裡面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'foreigners' as '被告她' is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of 'Foreign Land'.

那勞工局前往貴公司瞭解外國人的雇用狀況，以及居留證的申請細節，有發現什麼不符合的地方嗎？
So when the Labor Bureau come to your company, do they found out that your…the hiring conditions, ARC application is not reasonable?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, the representatives from the Bureau came but did not find anything wrong with our company or our hiring practice.
沒有，當勞工局的代表來的時候，他們沒有發現任何的問題。僱人方面也沒有任何問題。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'our company' in the translation.

如果勞工局的調查並沒有發現什麼不妥之處，或是違法之處，再加上剛剛被告也解釋，他撰寫這些文章的目的都只是希望貴公司能夠進行自清的動作，有沒有可能雙方進行和解呢？
So if the…if your hiring conditions and ARC application is…are nothing wrong. And the accused just hope that you can give a self-clarification. So will you consider to settle with him
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

We previously tried but failed to reach any conclusion. I would only consider settling this case with two things from the defendant. First, he has to formally apologize to Winwin for posting those inappropriate comments on Foreign Land. Second, as he said he heard all those details from “other foreign friends,” he should provide the names of those people to clear his own name.
我們之前已經嘗試過和解了，但我們沒有達到任何的協議。要我跟被告人進行和解，我有兩個條件。第一，他必須對文文公司提出非常的道歉。第二，他說他都是從其他外國朋友得知這些消息，所以他想要自清的話就需要提供這些人的全名。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

被告，就像剛剛告訴人所指出，如果要進行和解，他希望由你這邊採取兩個行動，第一，正式道歉，對於在外國園地所發表的文章，不論你的文章是否造成告訴人公司實質上的名譽受損，對方都希望你提出道歉。第二，你剛剛前面指出，你是從一些外國友人那邊，聽到告訴人公司有違法對待外國勞工之嫌，你可以提供這些友人的姓名嗎？
The accused, just as what the accuser said, if you wan to settle, you need to take two actions that he requested. First, you need to apologize formally. According to your article, no matter…no matter the company…the company’s reputation was damaged, you need to apologize to them. Second, you said that you heard your friends tell you that the company…the company is illegal of the hiring rules. Can you provide those people’s name?

grammar and structure	pronoun errors	incorrect pronoun usage
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	incorrect translation of terms
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	failure to translate 'accuser' and 'accused'

No, I would not consider these terms. First of all, I don’t know why I should apologize for posting some questions on the Internet. Since when is asking questions a crime? Second, Winwin cannot agree to settle the case with the term of obtaining names from me. This is not right.
不，我拒絕接受這兩個條件。第一，我不知道為什麼我只是發表一些評論就要道歉。從什麼時候開始問問題是一種罪? 第二，文文公司想要進行和解的方式是要公開我外國朋友的全名，我覺得這樣不合理。

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of 'settling the case'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of 'Winwin'

如果被告堅持因為文章的書寫內容都是以問題的方式進行，並沒有要毀謗告訴人公司的意圖，這顯然在第一個部分，你就是拒絕道歉，是嗎？
The defendant, the accused, you insist that you just asking questions instead of Libel, so you refuse to apologize, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

No, I will not consider making an apology.
對，我拒絕道歉。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'consider' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

對於告訴人的第二個要求，你也拒絕。是因為擔心告訴人公司會對那些人進行相關的法律訴訟，是嗎？
The reason why you refuse the second condition is because you afraid that the accuser will take a legal action against those foreign friends, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the company in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'you' before the verb 'refuse', resulting in incorrect word order.

The thing is that some of the friends used to or may be currently working for Winwin. How could I jeopardize them just for the sake of settling my own case? Why should they suffer the potential harm?
我擔心的是因為目前有人曾經或現在都還在文文公司工作。我怎麼可以出賣他們，就為了這個案子? 為什麼他們必須受到波及呢?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

如果雙方無法就和解進行任何退讓，那麼法院這邊只能將這一次的準備程序內容進行彙整，以便進行下一次的審理程序。雙方的辯護人，是不是能夠針對和解這個選擇，再跟你們的當事人談一談呢？
The accuser…if the both parties cannot settle, we will consider…we will consider to…collect the information of this court and…have the next court. Today the both parties have their lawyers, so the lawyer of both parties, can you talk to your…clients about settlement?

報告庭上，其實之前我們就有跟被告溝通，既然他說他的消息都是聽自其他友人，他大可以直接把那些人的名字提供給我們，而讓這一次的訴訟事件告一段落，但被告的態度一直很不合作，所以我們這邊也就無法進行進一步的和解動作。
Your honor, I am the accuser’s lawyer. Your honor, we have actually negotiated with the accused. As he said, he only heard all these information from his foreigner friends, he could just provide the full names of these friends and the case would be closed. But the defendant is very uncooperative, so we cannot take a further step to settle this case.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of previous communication with the accused.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'Your honor' in the middle of the sentence instead of at the beginning.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate the term '被告' (defendant) into the target language.

報告鈞院，其實我的當事人會有這樣的顧慮，最主要是因為告訴人公司雇用很多外國人士，我的當事人不希望因為提供友人姓名一事，而讓過去或目前為告訴人公司服務的外國人士，惹上不必要的麻煩。望請鈞院了解。
Your honor, I’m the accused’s lawyer. The reason why my client is concerned is because there are many foreigners work in the company. My client didn’t…my client isn’t willing to provide his friends’ name just because he didn’t want those foreigners work in the company get into troubles. Please understand.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the accused's concern about potential trouble for the foreigners working in the company.

既然告訴人跟被告雙方對於和解都各自有堅持，本庭定中華民國109年8月14日上午11點整進行審理程序。
Since both parties have their own concerns and stances, the next court will be set at 11 o’clock on August 14th 2020. We will have a trial procedure

 請問被告，有無需要法院進一步調查之證據？

No, your honor.
沒有。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence.

那告訴人這邊呢？
How about the accuser? Are there any evidence you want the court to investigate?

Saying as in the indictment.

被告因妨害名譽案件被檢察官起訴，起因是被告涉嫌在中華民國108年12月1日到109年1月20日之間，在網際網路論壇，名為Foreign Land (外國園地)，發表一連串的評論，雖此論壇之主要目的是提供在台居留外國人士交流之平台，但被告卻利用這樣一個平台進行對告訴人公司之批評，致使告訴人公司名譽受損。對此妨害名譽之告訴，有何辯解？
The defendant, you are prosecuted of violating an internet defamation. On December 1, 2019 to January 20, 2020, you were at an internet chatroom and you posted some comments. Although the purpose of this platform is to let some foreigners staying in Taiwan to exchange their thoughts. However, you posted some comments to criticize the accuser’s company, to damage the accuser’s reputation. What’s your plea?

I plead not guilty.
我沒有罪。

請問你知道「外國園地」這個論壇嗎？
I’m going to inquire the accused.The accused, do you know the forum of “Foreign Land”?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外國園地' as 'Foreign Land' instead of 'Foreign Forum'.

Yes, Foreign Land is a forum very popular among foreigners.
對啊，因為外國園地在外國人間是很受歡迎的。

我不會說我有一個發文的頻率。我只在我關心些議題或想抒發感受的時候才會發文。

提示偵券(一)65頁。這一頁是取自中華民國108年12月13日在「外國園地」中發表的內容。請你看一下，這是你寫的嗎？
Now I’m going to read the investigation procedure page 65.This page describes a content from Foreign Land on December 13, 2019. Is this post written by you?

It seems to be my posting but it was posted some time ago, I am not sure if the article is in its entirety.
這篇好像是我寫的但是因為已經是一段時間以前的了，所以我不太確定這篇的完整性。

你在文中所提到的主要內容為何？請陳述。
Could you please state the main idea to the court?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the main idea of the original text.

As you can see from the copy, I posted some concerns and questions regarding Winwin company, especially about how foreigners were treated by that company.
就像你們可以看到的這篇貼文，我在上頭寫了一些我的疑慮以及問題，關於雙贏這個公司它們是怎麼對待外國人的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific concerns and questions mentioned in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb phrase '它們是怎麼對待外國人的' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject '雙贏這個公司'.

你剛剛講到的某一公司，請問有在任何一篇文章當中，明確指出該公司的全名嗎？
You just mention company’s name, and did you state clearly of the company’s full name on any posts?

Yes, I am sure I have used the company’s full name, Winwin.
是的，我很確定我有用雙贏公司的全名。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你在65頁的內容中，提到該公司常常在雇用外國人時，沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利，更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況。請問，你這樣講，有證據嗎？
You mentioned in page 65 that when the company is hiring a foreigner, they often violate the Basic Labor Law, the basic labor hour, and wage and welfare.Moreover, you mention that, from time to time when the company isn’t applying the working VISA for the foreign, do you have any evidence regarding this?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the company not providing basic working hours, wages, and benefits to foreign employees.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the company not applying for work visas for foreign employees.

I did mention those issues. I did not have evidence. I heard those issues from some other foreign friends who either worked for that company or had experiences with that company. As a result, I expressed my concerns in the question format, meaning I asked all those questions regarding working hours, basic salary, benefits and ARC application with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions.
我有提到這件事情但我還沒有證據。我有從一些外國朋友口中聽說，而那些朋友都是在公司工作或是和那些人交手過的。所以我用問問題的方式來表達我的想法，我的意思是我的問題都是有關勞基法、基本工時、基本薪資以及福利，以及雙贏公司是怎麼對外國居留證申請的方式，所以我希望他們可以出面澄清這個問題。

你的意思是說，你是從其他外國朋友那邊聽到這些細節，但不是本人的第一手資料，是嗎？
So you mean that you obtain this information from other friends, and these details are not firsthand information, right?

True. I heard those details from other friends, also the registered members of Foreign Land.
沒錯我就是從其他外國朋友那邊聽來的，以及從外國園地的註冊會員。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'registered members' in the Foreign Land.

那你怎麼可以在一個公開的論壇中，直接把聽來的東西，就做了轉述呢？
So how can you in such public forum and directly state what you have heard on the post?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I didn’t quote others and post the concerns as accusations. Instead, all my comments were questions. I was hoping Winwin would provide some sort of clarifications so that the foreign community would not hold any wrong ideas against that company.
我並沒有引述其他人說的話在我的貼文當中，也不是控告的形式，我只是用問題的方式呈現。我只是希望雙贏公司可以提供某些形式的澄清，所以在我們的社群當中，才不會給外國人有錯誤的印象。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'comments' in the translation, which is a critical detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '引述' (quote) before the noun '其他人說的話' (what others said), resulting in a word order error.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'post the concerns as accusations' as '控告的形式' (accusatory form), which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做你都是用問題的方式來進行批評？可以解釋一下嗎？
What do you mean by asking questions? Could you explain further?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

For example, I asked in one posting “Is it true that Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC, the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally?”.
舉例來說，我曾在一篇貼文問說，雙贏公司是否真的沒有幫助外國人申請居留證，也就是他們可以合法在台工作的權利。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of Winwin as the company in question.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order, placing the mention of Winwin at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the question.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses '雙贏公司' instead of 'Winwin', which may not accurately convey the specific company being referred to.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user's translation does not include the translation of 'ARC' (Alien Resident Certificate), which is a critical term in the original text.

所以你發表這一系列文章的目的只是為了釐清所謂的「真相」，是嗎？
So your purposes of this post are finding out the truth, right?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '釐清所謂的「真相」' as 'finding out the truth', which is not an accurate translation. '釐清' means 'clarify' or 'clear up', and '真相' means 'truth'. So a more accurate translation would be 'clarifying the so-called 'truth''.

Yes, I only wanted to get some clarifications or explanations. However, instead of responding to my questions directly, Winwin chose to file this lawsuit against me.
是的，我只想要得到他們的澄清或解釋。然而，他們並沒有直接的回應我，雙贏公司選擇了控告我的方式。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of what they wanted clarification or explanation on.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'file this lawsuit against me'.

雖然告訴人有提供他們自外國園地抓下來文章內容，但他們也告訴檢方，這些內容並不完整。所以就你記憶所及，你大概連續發表了幾篇呢？
Although the accuser provide some articles contents, they have informed that these informations are not complete. How many post have you posts?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific number or range of posts mentioned in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'have' before the subject 'you' instead of after.

你的意思是說當這個訴訟開始進行的時候，那個論壇的版主就進行了刪文的動作嗎？
What you meant was when the lawsuit came to effect, the administrator will delete all the post?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that is correct.
沒錯。

也就是說，你完全沒有辦法確定你一共為此事件發表過幾篇文章？
That is you still aren’t that sure how many post you have posted upon this issue?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

That’s correct, too.
也沒錯。

那就你記憶所及，你曾經接到過該公司任何希望你停止批評他們的要求嗎？你有照做嗎？
In your memory, did the company send you any requirement or warning to stop posting?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of the company's name in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'send' before the subject 'the company' in the translation.

I think towards the end of my postings, I did get a request from Winwin, asking me to stop posting articles about their company. I didn’t stop immediately because, again, I was only asking questions.
在我停止發文之前，都沒有收到任何要我停止發文的消息。我沒有立即停止發文，因為就像我之前所說的，我只是在問問題而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of receiving a request from Winwin to stop posting articles about their company.

所以你還是堅持，因為你都是用問題的方式來發表評論，並沒有直接毀謗該公司名譽的事實，是嗎？
So the defendant, you still insist that you are posting in the form of posting questions, instead of directly libeling the company to damage their reputation. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It was never my intention to defame Winwin. I don’t quite understand how a series of questions could possibly constitute “defamation.”
我從來就沒有想過要妨害雙贏公司的名譽。我還是不太了解一連串的問題會構成妨害名譽或毀謗。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那請問告訴人，貴公司是什麼時候開始瞭解到，在「外國園地」當中，有關於貴公司的文章？
Next I will ask the plaintiff some questions. Plaintiff, when did you find that there are some comments about your company?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'foreign' in the phrase 'foreign field'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'about your company' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'comments'.

This issue first came to our attention around December 2019. My wife and I personally were not active in that kind of forums. We were only informed by some friends about the malicious comments on Foreign Land until then.
這些問題主要首次是在2019年12月我們有意識到。我跟我老婆一開始並沒有在這個論壇上很活躍。我們是在朋友跟我們告知有這些惡意的評論之後才意識到這件事情。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'Foreign Land' in their translation, which is a critical detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect in the phrase '我跟我老婆一開始並沒有在這個論壇上很活躍', where the subject '我跟我老婆' should come before the verb '一開始'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '意識' to translate 'informed', which does not accurately convey the meaning of being informed by someone.

對於剛剛被告表示他只是提出一連串的問題，希望貴公司回答這些問題，並沒有以陳述方式毀謗貴公司的名譽。你有何意見？
The defendent said that he didn‘t he just wrote the comment in the form of asking questions instead of statements. About this, what’s your idea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That’s not true. In English, even when comments are made in the question format, they still carry enough force to make readers wonder or question the facts implied by the questions. Even when the defendant said he only asked questions, damage was done to my company.
這不對。這在英文裡面，即使是用問題的形式，它也是有強力的作用去質疑事實。也就是說，當被告問了這些問題的時候，他對我們的公司就造成了毁謗、造成我們的名譽受損。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你的意思是說，不管對方是否用問題方式提出質疑，你們公司的名譽實際上都有所損害嗎？請解釋一下。
Can you make a further explanation that no matter the defendant used the question or not, your company...the reputation of your company is still damaged?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, when the defendant asked those questions, it caused doubt and suspicion in the circle of foreigners in Taiwan. Foreigners form their own circle here in Taiwan and rumors travel fast. That’s why even the Labor Bureau paid several visits to our company, trying to find out if we were involved in the matters posted on Foreign Land.
沒錯，被告的確造成了一些質疑。公司的確受到損害了，因為這些謠言都已經傳遍了。台灣的勞工局也有來造訪我們，去試圖找出我們是否牽涉其中。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of foreigners forming their own circle in Taiwan.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of rumors traveling fast.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the matters being posted on Foreign Land.

那勞工局前往貴公司瞭解外國人的雇用狀況，以及居留證的申請細節，有發現什麼不符合的地方嗎？
So when Labor Bureau went to visit your company and asked you about the your hiring and applying for ARC, are there any violations of your rule?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, the representatives from the Bureau came but did not find anything wrong with our company or our hiring practice.
沒有，他們有過來探視但沒有發現任何問題，在申請上面都沒有問題。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the Bureau representatives' visit to the company.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在申請上面' (in the application) at the end of the sentence, which changes the intended meaning.

如果勞工局的調查並沒有發現什麼不妥之處，或是違法之處，再加上剛剛被告也解釋，他撰寫這些文章的目的都只是希望貴公司能夠進行自清的動作，有沒有可能雙方進行和解呢？
If the Labor Bureau did not find anything wrong in your company. Furthermore, the aim of the defendant’s asking your question is to want to get your self-clarification; as a result, is there any chance for you to make a settlement?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

We previously tried but failed to reach any conclusion. I would only consider settling this case with two things from the defendant. First, he has to formally apologize to Winwin for posting those inappropriate comments on Foreign Land. Second, as he said he heard all those details from “other foreign friends,” he should provide the names of those people to clear his own name.
我們之前有試過，但最後都沒有達到任何共識。我只對這個被告要求兩件事。第一件事情，我只希望他能公開道歉，說明他對外國園地的毀謗。第二，就像他說的，他是從其他人那邊聽到這些消息細節的，他應該要提供到底確切是從哪些人聽到的。

被告，就像剛剛告訴人所指出，如果要進行和解，他希望由你這邊採取兩個行動，第一，正式道歉，對於在外國園地所發表的文章，不論你的文章是否造成告訴人公司實質上的名譽受損，對方都希望你提出道歉。第二，你剛剛前面指出，你是從一些外國友人那邊，聽到告訴人公司有違法對待外國勞工之嫌，你可以提供這些友人的姓名嗎？
Defendant, as the accuser required, if you want to reach a settlement, you have to take the following two actions...the above mentioned two actions. First, you have to apologize formally. Regarding your posts on the Foreign Land, no matter you had caused damage to their reputation... As you mentioned before, you have heard these rumors from your foreign friends, and could you please provide those friends’ names, since you are suspected of violating defamation.

grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'rumors' instead of 'articles'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating 'Foreign Land'

No, I would not consider these terms. First of all, I don’t know why I should apologize for posting some questions on the Internet. Since when is asking questions a crime? Second, Winwin cannot agree to settle the case with the term of obtaining names from me. This is not right.
不，我不會考慮以上兩個方式。首先，我還是不懂為什麼我只是問一些問題就要受到處罰。從什麼時候開始問問題變成一種罪？第二，雙贏公司並不同意要和解，若是我提供這些人的姓名。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'settle the case' is not accurately translated.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'apologize' in the translation.

如果被告堅持因為文章的書寫內容都是以問題的方式進行，並沒有要毀謗告訴人公司的意圖，這顯然在第一個部分，你就是拒絕道歉，是嗎？
The defendant you insist that you are writing these posts in the form of asking questions, so you refuse to apologize, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I will not consider making an apology.
不，我並不考慮要道歉。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'consider' in the translation.

對於告訴人的第二個要求，你也拒絕。是因為擔心告訴人公司會對那些人進行相關的法律訴訟，是嗎？
As for the second request of the accuser, do you worry that your foreign friends will be filed a lawsuit against?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the company in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'your foreign friends' before the verb 'will be filed', resulting in incorrect word order.

The thing is that some of the friends used to or may be currently working for Winwin. How could I jeopardize them just for the sake of settling my own case? Why should they suffer the potential harm?
重點是，有些友人是曾經或是現在正在雙贏工作的。我怎麼忍心讓他們暴露在危險當中，只是為了要和解？為什麼他們要暴露在這些潛在的危險當中？
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'settling my own case' in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of 'jeopardizing friends' who work for Winwin.'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'suffering potential harm' in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of 'friends suffering potential harm.'

如果雙方無法就和解進行任何退讓，那麼法院這邊只能將這一次的準備程序內容進行彙整，以便進行下一次的審理程序。雙方的辯護人，是不是能夠針對和解這個選擇，再跟你們的當事人談一談呢？
The accuser if you don’t want to make any compromise against this settlement, we will gathering this information together to be the next court’s evidence. Today, the accuser and the defendant both have their lawyer. Regarding settlement, can both the lawyer talk to your client?

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'accuser' instead of 'defendant'
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	not using appropriate legal terminology

報告庭上，其實之前我們就有跟被告溝通，既然他說他的消息都是聽自其他友人，他大可以直接把那些人的名字提供給我們，而讓這一次的訴訟事件告一段落，但被告的態度一直很不合作，所以我們這邊也就無法進行進一步的和解動作。
Your Honor, I am the lawyer of the accuser. Your Honor, actually we have talked to the defendant before. Since the defendant obtained those details from his friends, Therefore, he can provide us the names of his friends and let the court to come to an end. However, the defendant is unwilling to cooperate with us, so the settlement cannot be made.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the previous communication between the parties.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'Your Honor' in the middle of the sentence instead of at the beginning.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the crucial information that the defendant's attitude was uncooperative.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence about the inability to proceed with further reconciliation due to the defendant's uncooperative attitude.

報告鈞院，其實我的當事人會有這樣的顧慮，最主要是因為告訴人公司雇用很多外國人士，我的當事人不希望因為提供友人姓名一事，而讓過去或目前為告訴人公司服務的外國人士，惹上不必要的麻煩。望請鈞院了解。
Your Honor, I’m the lawyer of the defendant. Actually, the concerns... the main concerns of my client is that your company has hired many of his friends. My client doesn’t hope to provide those names since those friends are...used to work in your company or currently work in your company, so he doesn’t want them to get into trouble. Your Honor, hope you can understand.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the defendant's concerns regarding providing the names of his friends who work or have worked in the company.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the critical context that the defendant's concerns are related to potential trouble for his friends who work or have worked in the company.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'the main concerns of my client' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'is'.

既然告訴人跟被告雙方對於和解都各自有堅持，本庭定中華民國109年8月14日上午11點整進行審理程序。
Since that both parties are hold their own insistence, so we will set the next court, the trial procedure on at 11 AM on August 14, 2020.

 請問被告，有無需要法院進一步調查之證據？
The dependent, do you need any further investigation, the court can help you.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'dependent' before the verb 'do' instead of the other way around.

No, your honor.
不，沒有。

那告訴人這邊呢？
How about the accuser, do you want the court to help you investigate any evidence?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the location where the accuser wants to be informed.

I will think about it. If anything comes up, I will ask my lawyer to place a request to the court.
讓我們再思考一下，如果需要的話我會請我的律師再跟庭上詢問。

被告，你被檢察官起訴在民國109年3月8日於新北市樹林區學府路與大學路交叉口、7-11門口前，盜取他人摩托車一輛，車牌號碼為BL-1234，經由摩托車持有人報案後，警方於柑園路一段25號附近尋獲。經警方調閱7-11門口監視器，確認摩托車為你所竊，有何辯解？
The defendant, you are prosecuted by the prosecutor that on March 8th 2020, on the door of a 7-11 at the intersection of Xuefu Rd and Daxue Rd you stole a motorcycle which had the plate number BL-1234. After the owner of the motorcycle reported the case to the police, the police found the motorcycle around Ganyuan Rd, Sec 1. After the police checked the CCTV clip…
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the location of the incident (新北市樹林區)

 I did not steal the motorcycle. On that day, it was rainy very hard. My friend and I did not bring an umbrella and we were in a hurry to get home. So, we decided to borrow the motorcycle. Our plan was to give it back, you know, we planned to put the motorbike back to the original place the second day. We didn’t mean to steal it at all.
我沒有偷那輛摩托車，那天，雨下得很大，我和我的朋友沒有帶傘，但是我們急著回家，所以我們決定「借用」一下那輛摩托車，我們有打算要還回去，真的，我們想說隔天把摩托車放回原來的地方，我們真的沒有要偷的意思。

No, but I was in a hurry to go home that day. My plane was leaving on the second day to go back to my country. I am really sorry. That was a terrible mistake.

At that time, I just came out from the convenience store. It was raining and I saw that motorcycle. I realized the owner must have forgotten to take out the key. I thought I could use it briefly and bring it back soon.

Yes, the key was left in the ignition, so I just rode the motorbike away.

After we rode the bike away, I first gave my friend a ride home. Then I went back to my apartment. I was very tired and went to bed directly. I was thinking to return the motorbike the next day. But, on the second day, my plane was leaving so I totally forgot about this plan.
我們騎走摩托車後，我先把我的朋友載回他家，然後我再回去我的公寓，那時我已經很累，所以我就直接去睡覺，隔天我就想要把它還回去了，但是，我隔天忙著要處理回國的事，所以我就完全忘記這件事了。

You know that the owner of the motorcycle call for the police, right? In our country, the theft is a criminal brought to the court only when a lawsuit is filed. Which means that if the owner file a suit for you, this case can be removed. Then, did you try to communicate with the accuser?

Today is the preparation procedure. We will set the date of the next proceeding. Please bring the original copy of the settlement letter with you the next time.

沒有帶傘就可以偷人家車子嗎？
You didn’t bring your umbrella, so you stole the motorcycle?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by changing the action of stealing a car to stealing a motorcycle.

No, but I was in a hurry to go home that day. My plane was leaving on the second day to go back to my country. I am really sorry. That was a terrible mistake.
沒有，我只是想要趕快回家。我要搭隔天的飛機回我的國家。我很抱歉犯了這麼大的錯誤。

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'motorcycle' and 'was'.

你知道後來摩托車主人報警了吧？在我們的法律上，竊盜罪是告訴乃論，也就是說，如果摩托車的主人願意不告你的話，那這個案子就可以撤掉，那你後來有跟對方有任何的溝通嗎？
Did you know the owner of the motorcycle reported the case to the police, right? As our law, theft is a case that is substantiated when you file a lawsuit. That is, if the owner of the motorcycle doesn’t sue you, the case can be dropped. Did you try to communicate with the other party?

我們今天的程序是準備程序，會訂下一次的庭期，請你把和解書正本帶過來，那你還有沒有什麼要請法庭幫你調查的證據呢？那天跟你在一起的朋友，你希望法庭傳喚他做證人嗎？我的意思是，你需不需要他來幫忙你說明這個案情？
Today is the preparatory procedure. We will set the date next time and please bring the settlement here next time. Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate?

我朋友現在在台灣。他應該可以幫忙解釋這一切。他知道我要還這機車，他真的知道。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '他知道我要還這機車' instead of '他知道我要還這機車，他真的知道。'

那這樣子，我們下一次開庭的時候，會請你的朋友，也就是Mark Alison到庭，說明當天的情況，也會請摩托車所有人，也就是當事人到庭，說明和解的細由。
Okay, so in next court, I will ask your friend to come here to help you figure out the situation.We will also invite the accuser here to file the case.

The motorcycle’s license plate is 1234. According to someone’s... according to someone who called the police, the motorcycle was found at No.25 Gan-Yuan Road Section 1.

 I did not steal the motorcycle. On that day, it was rainy very hard. My friend and I did not bring an umbrella and we were in a hurry to get home. So, we decided to borrow the motorcycle. Our plan was to give it back, you know, we planned to put the motorbike back to the original place the second day. We didn’t mean to steal it at all.
我沒有罪。我沒有偷那輛摩托車。那天雨下得非常大。我和我的朋友都沒有帶傘然後我們都很想要趕快回家。所以我們打算借這台摩托車。我們有打算要把它放回去，我們原本的計畫是隔天把摩托車放回原位。我們無意偷竊。

沒有帶傘就可以偷人家車子嗎？
Can you steal the motorcycle just because you didn’t bring your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, but I was in a hurry to go home that day. My plane was leaving on the second day to go back to my country. I am really sorry. That was a terrible mistake.
不是阿，啊我就很急著要回家。我隔天要搭飛機回去我的國家，我對我的犯錯我很抱歉。

為什麼會偷那部車子呢？我的意思是為什麼是那部，而不是別部車呢
Then why did you steal that motorcycle, I mean… why is it that motorcycle, instead of other motorcycles?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At that time, I just came out from the convenience store. It was raining and I saw that motorcycle. I realized the owner must have forgotten to take out the key. I thought I could use it briefly and bring it back soon.
當時我剛從便利商店出來。那時候在下雨然後我剛好就看到那一台摩托車。我發現摩托車的主人忘記把鑰匙拔出來了。我想說可以快速的使用一下這個摩托車然後還回來。

Yes, the key was left in the ignition, so I just rode the motorbike away.
對，因為車鑰匙忘了拔，所以我就直接把摩托車騎走了。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那你剛剛說，原來的計畫是要把車子還回去，那你有這樣做嗎？

After we rode the bike away, I first gave my friend a ride home. Then I went back to my apartment. I was very tired and went to bed directly. I was thinking to return the motorbike the next day. But, on the second day, my plane was leaving so I totally forgot about this plan.

那為什麼車子後來會跑到柑園路去了呢？

I don’t know. I talked to my landlord. He told me that he didn’t know whose motorbike that was. He didn’t feel comfortable about having it parked in front of our apartment building. Maybe the motorbike was moved there.
我不知道，但我跟地主談過了。他告訴我她不太知道那台摩托車是誰的。他覺得把這台摩托車停在我們租的這棟大樓前面感到很不舒服。所以也許這台摩托車被他移動到那了。

你知道後來摩托車主人報警了吧？在我們的法律上，竊盜罪是告訴乃論，也就是說，如果摩托車的主人願意不告你的話，那這個案子就可以撤掉，那你後來有跟對方有任何的溝通嗎？
Do you know that the owner of the motorcycle have called the police? According to our law, theft is a crime is brought to the court only when the lawsuit is filed. That is to say, if the owner of the motorcycle decided not to sue you, and the case will be….will be …..dropped. Do you have.. Do you try to communicate with the other party?

Yes, when I returned to Taiwan after that trip, the police told me about this case. I met with the motorbike owner. I said sorry to him and agreed to offer him some money.
有的，我回台灣的時候警察有告知我關於這個案件的詳情。我和摩托車車主見了面。我跟他說了對不起然後同意提供金錢賠償。

那調解的過程怎麼樣，對方願意接受你的道歉嗎？
Then how was the mediation? Did the other party accept your conditions?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	rearranging the sentence structure

We reached an agreement at the amount of NT$6,000. The owner accepted my apology. He brought the motorbike to the shop to have a check. The bike was not damaged and just needed a small tune-up.
我們達成了共識，決定我要賠他6000元。而摩托車的車主接受了我的道歉，他把他的車子帶去檢查，摩托車並沒有壞掉，只是需要一點小小的維修。

雙方有達成和解金的數字嗎？

Yes, NT$6,000 and I gave the money to the owner already.
有阿，我們決定和解金是6000元，我也把錢給他了。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '已經給錢給他了' as '我也把錢給他了', which changes the meaning from 'I gave the money to the owner already' to 'I also gave the money to him'.

那你們什麼時候要簽和解書呢，還是已經簽了呢？
Then when are you going to sign the settlement paper? Or have you signed it already?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

We signed the settlement letter.
我們已經簽了和解書了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我们簽了和解書' instead of '我们已经簽了和解書了'.

我們今天的程序是準備程序，會訂下一次的庭期，請你把和解書正本帶過來，那你還有沒有什麼要請法庭幫你調查的證據呢？那天跟你在一起的朋友，你希望法庭傳喚他做證人嗎？我的意思是，你需不需要他來幫忙你說明這個案情？
Our case today is a preparatory procedure. We will set the date of the next court, and please bring the settlement paper with you next time. Do you need other…investigation that need court to help you? Do you hope to…do you hope that we supo… supone your friend? I mean that do you need … do you need your friend to help you explain the case?

我朋友現在在台灣，也許他可以一起解釋那天發生了什麼。他知道我打算要把車子還回去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The plaintiff…the plaintiff…the plaintiff wanted to file the case against his… her husband for… for the suspect that he is having an affair with his coworkers. Because she has found some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphones, and, sometimes, her husband would make up reasons for extra hours for the… his work. Also, he would have tele-conference with his coworkers, so the plaintiff is suspect that her husband has a relationship with his coworker beyond coworker’s relationship. The defendant, your wife sue you with the adultery case, what’s your plea?

Not guilty, of course.
當然無罪。

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, first, we are going to examine the text messages between the defendant and his coworker, and we will…we will decided whether this message would constitute adultery case. Does the plaintiff…Do the plaintiff and the defendant fully understand today’s procedure?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical details of the procedure, which is to clarify if the defendant and his coworker are involved in an extramarital affair.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. Instead of 'Does the plaintiff...Do the plaintiff and the defendant fully understand today’s procedure?', it should be 'Do the plaintiff and the defendant fully understand today’s procedure?'

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for 4 years, and we didn’t.. and we don’t have kids.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'already' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
So…did you and your husband get married in Taiwan, or you get married in foreign country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
My husband and I met in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he was here to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is from Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '4 years ago' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'met'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '想要' as 'was here to' instead of 'wanted to'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Then, during the past few years, is his job in Taiwan teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a teacher to teach Portuguese. Then, after we get married, he still teaching Portuguese. However, in Taiwan, Portuguese is not a popular language to learn from, so, sometimes, he didn’t have a… his teaching hour is not stable or regular, and sometimes, there are a period between jobs that is as long as a month or even two month. Then , in order to have a steady and stable incomes, he decided to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree on English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. It means that he seek an advanced degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in the translation.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wanted to teach English, so the degree of his seeking has to be about English teaching. He found an Internet courses about distance learning program in the University of California, and this course is that he doesn’t have to go to America to learn, but he can have a distance learning in Taiwan about English teaching. So after he finishes all the credits of the internet courses, then he can get a master degree. Therefore, he can use this American advanced degree to English teaching job in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then... What is his relationship with the person he had affair with?

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are the coworkers in the cram school. And in the cram school, they have a program that a Chinese teacher would partner up with an foreign teacher, so the woman is his partner.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So… in his phone, did you find anything unusual?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
First, I look up his phone book. Then I found out that there is a same number that calls over and over. And then I found out that the texts he got are all from the same person, the same woman. Then I realize that he and that woman text every single day.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even though they are texting, it is alright. It is not a big deal. The context is fine. It’s not horrible, right?

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it was a very normal and regular text, it would be fine. But he is a married man, and in the texts, there are some intimate message, and those message I have already filed to the court as the evidence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
As you can see the exhibit 1, there was the context of the message, and I would like to ask the defendant, are those messages from your cellphone?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機裡的訊息。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
If that’s so, I would like to ask you some questions about these message. The first, I would like to ask the text from the cellphone number 0958932123 on December 21st, 2018. The time was 9:50 p.m. And in the context, it was written, “I really miss you my love.” What did it mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那個簡訊是從我的同事那傳給我的，那時候我請了兩天假，然後他就覺得有點小擔心，然後傳簡訊來關心我一下而已。我的同事是在美國受的教育，所以他才會這麼的開放，那這些說話方式也只是她表達他自己的一些說法，那剛剛提到的那個my love，也就只是我們稱我們關心的人的親暱的名字。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So what you mean is that, the person was educated in the west, so her mind is westernized. And therefore, the way she express her emotion and feelings are more open? And so…the phrase “my love” is not a big deal and didn’t mean anything.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its cultural significance.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user fails to understand the cultural significance of the phrase '我的愛' and its importance in expressing emotions in the original language.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
是的，那只是我們在比較親密的朋友之間會稱呼彼此的方式而已。
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	not accurately translating the cultural context of the expression

那她前面那句呢？
How about the first part of the message?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛說的阿，他就只是擔心我而已，因為那時候…我們兩個是工作上的搭檔。所以在我請兩天假的時候，他就是非常的擔心我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們兩個是工作上的搭檔' instead of '他就只是擔心我而已'
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation omits the critical context of the speaker being away for two days, which is important for understanding the situation.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So what you mean is that the person…when you are away, she needs your assistance during the teaching, so she sent you the message to express her worries and concerns,. Is that what you mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，那就是這簡訊的意義，所以這封簡訊根本就沒有什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	The user added the phrase '所以' (so) which is not present in the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Then, we will examine the second message. It was sent by the same cellphone. And the time was on December 29th, 2017 at 11:55 p.m. It was written, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this text mean? Could you explain?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他寫這個訊息就只是想要問我說，在我的中文文本中要怎麼翻成英文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean is that she sent you the message in order to help you to accomplish your homework? What does it even mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of the original text

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛在前面的時候跟法庭告知的，我現在在上一堂就是碩士的課程，那這整個課程有三十個學分，那為了要完成這三十個學分，裡面難免會有些作業跟一些練習，那我當然要完成這些東西。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added unnecessary information

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you first explain what did you major in for your master degree?

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的主修是在英語教學，那在其中的一些課程安排上，就是有些英語教學的課程沒錯，那來有另一個部分是關於文化以及語言能力的一些課程，那就當然其中有一些...這些東西。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you mean that the field you choose is TESOL, there are some culture and language communication in the course?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我印象中是起碼有三堂課跟文化語言溝通有關的課。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what is the assignment which is related to the cultural and language communication?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這堂課程的作業在每個學生身上都不太一樣。那以我為例的話，因為我現在在台灣，然後想要取得英文教學的工作，那為了要達成這個目標，那勢必我是一定要有能力去掌握中文。所以我有很多的作業是要怎麼中翻英或是英翻中。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Therefore, in order to fulfill the plan that you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to finish and complete the assignment or translate English into Chinese, or Chinese into English?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，而同時間我也被耀球說我要精進我的口說及寫作的能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, then we will go back to the texts we have been presenting, so the text was your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，那就是我的作業，那在當時的時候，我拿到句子的時候，我完全不知道要怎麼翻，你也知道，就是中文有些詞彙就是很難翻譯成英文，所以在當時我拿到作業時，我完全不知道該怎麼翻譯，所以我就是向我的同事求助，那我就請他在翻完之後，將翻譯傳簡訊給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Well, according by your claim, that this text message was only the question of your assignment. And the college is only translate the assignment for you and give you the answer. Is that what you claim?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical context of the original text, which mentioned asking a colleague in Chinese and receiving an answer in English via text message.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect and does not convey the intended meaning.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那個內容只是我功課的答案而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the homework assignment.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Okay, now the defendant please read the exhibit 1, page 14 to page 16, are all these messages the answers of your assignment for your master degree?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊內容都只是為了要完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the messages being referred to.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Well… what’s your explanation about your wife suspect that you are having an affair with your coworker. What’s your explanation?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我太太真的是在這件事情上想太多了，我一直知道他一直很不滿意我養家活口的能力，而在我一開始要在去進修，取得碩士學位的時候後，他就完全沒有表現出支持我的舉動或是…沒有任何支持。因為她一直沒有就是表現出任何支持，所以我就沒有想要去問他，或是請他幫我完成這些作業，而我就覺得說，他就是這整個誤解的罪魁禍首。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your explanation, it seems that there are some unhappiness between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在一開始新婚的時候，我們的確過得很愉快，但是就是主要問題就是我的工作，因為在我一開始在這裡教授葡萄牙文，但是一直碰壁又碰到困難，就變成了我們主要的問題。所以就，我的工作就變成我們吵架的問題，我們就時常為了這種問題吵架，然後這整個狀況，造成我非常的沮喪、非常的洩氣、非常的挫折。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, then we’ll go back to your master degree. When did you start your master degree? Do you finish it? And when will you get your diplomat?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年的秋天註冊的，就開始這個課程那他預計是兩年的課程，那我應該會是在2017年的五月的時候畢業，但是我一直沒有完成這個學位是因為我一直都有一些兼職工作，所以我就沒有時間去完成我的那些作業。就像我剛剛提到的，就我太太一直都沒有很支持我的這個決定，所以在整個求學過程中我一直覺得很沮喪，而且很累，所以我就還沒有拿到這個學位。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So you just mentioned that this program is designed for 2 years, and you didn’t finish it, so what is the main reason of that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成所有的課程作業，還有一些課程的要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out 'all' in 'I couldn’t finish all the course assignments'

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So when is the last semester you register?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後一個學期是在2017年的春天註冊的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So if it is true, as you just mentioned, that the course has already finish in May, 2017. So it is reasonable that after the course you didn’t have any assignment. But after the semester has ended, during the 7 months you have the text message with your coworker, what’s the purpose.

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'purpose' instead of 'reason'

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我沒有完成我的學位，也不代表說我就不要再精進我的語言能力，所以在這個課程結束後，我就還是做一些作業、一些練習，就是我是自學啦，自修這樣子。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that despite you didn’t finish the course, you still want to improve your language competence, so you continue to write this text?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'learning Chinese' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'so you continue to write this text' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'language competence'.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是為什麼我會向我的同事求救。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '是的' (Yes) at the end of the sentence instead of the beginning.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'colleague' as '同事' (colleague) instead of '朋友' (friend).

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So this coworker you have, she is like tutor, Chinese tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'Chinese tutor' instead of 'tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不是我的家教而已，他更是一個很好很好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'tutor' is translated as '家教' which means 'private tutor' instead of 'tutor'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'true friend' is translated as '很好很好的朋友' which means 'very good friend' instead of 'true friend'.

你有付錢給她嗎
So… do you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the pronoun 'you' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我原本說要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我原本說要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why she answers your texts in the middle of the night? Doesn’t it exceed the relationship of being a coworker?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the original meaning.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就是為什麼我會說他是個非常好的朋友，因為他是利用他自己的時間在教我中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in the cram school as a English teacher?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那邊工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does the coworker still worker there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，他還在那邊工作，但我們現在已經不是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any other witness or other evidence that you wanted to provided to the court or the person you want to subpoena further?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like the court to subpoena the coworker, Rong-er Huang as witness to clarify the evidence of the texts and to clarify and explain the relationship of the defendant and her.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the details of the coworker's job at Mei Er Mei tutoring center.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase 'the evidence of the texts'. It should be 'the evidence of the texts'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The plaintiff, do you have any other evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in their translation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I have heard that the cram school trying to fix the relationship with my husband and the coworker, and they’re trying to convince the coworker to leave, to quit the job. So I wanted the court to ask the cram school for further statement or subpoena them as witness.

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any other evidence the you want the court to investigate for you. Now the situation is that, because your degree program have already finished in May, 2017, so it cannot be the evidence or explanation for your relationship with your coworker. And most of your message is sent at 9 p.m. Therefore, it is a very suspicious movement or relationship between you and your coworker. Therefore, do you have any other evidence that you can prove that you and your coworker are only the relationship of college or friend to clarify that. Do you have any other evidence to clarify that?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase '希望法庭為你調查的事證' (evidence that you want the court to investigate for you).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'the defendant' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'have'. The correct word order should be 'Do you, the defendant, have any other evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我目前想步道法院可以幫我調查的證據，就像我所說的，我跟我同事之間的關係非常的單純，我們倆之間的訊息就只是為了要增進我的語言能力以及我的中文能力而已。

Same as the indictment.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure, and the case is prosecuted by the accuser Yu Han Wang. The incident is caused from the accuser’s husband Edward Papayashi. The defendant, Edward Papayashi… so her husband is prosecuted with a crime of adultery case and her husband Edward Papayashi had sent an intimate message with her co-worker and they had too close reaction. And they often work overtime, and in the late night they had tele-conferencing. And it seems that this relationship is beyond co-worker’s relationship. The defendant, your wife Yu Han Wang think that you have an affair with your co-worker, and you are prosecuted with a crime of adultery. What’s your plea?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the judge will mainly ask the defendant and to understand the details and the relationship between the defendant and his co-worker to clarify whether the defendant and his co-worker have affairs and constitute adultery case. Do the both party understand the procedure today?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical detail that the judge will be asking the defendant and his co-worker about their communication details.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context that the purpose of asking about the communication details is to determine if there is an extramarital affair.

我明白
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
是的，我了解

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
the accuser, first I want to ask you, how long have you and your husband been married, and do you have children with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
Oh, we have been married for four years, and we don’t have children.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out the mention of 'my husband'

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Well, so you too got married in Taiwan or in foreign countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
My husband and I met in Taiwan, and four years ago, my husband just came to Taiwan, and he wanted to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is also from Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'just' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'my husband' instead of 'he' to refer to the speaker's husband.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past years, has he taught Portuguese in Taiwan for four years?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he taught Portuguese. And after we got married, he continued teaching Portuguese. However, you know that Portuguese in Taiwan is not a popular language, and it’s not common, so the teaching hours is not stable, and sometimes will even have a period between jobs. And sometimes, the period between jobs could last for one to two months. And because my husband wants to have a stable income, so he wanted to …tended to teach English. And however, his mother tongue is not English, so he sought an advanced degree and want to polish his English.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the husband's teaching hours for Portuguese were unstable and sometimes had gaps of one to two months.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'And sometimes, the period between jobs could last for one to two months.' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'And however' at the beginning of the sentence, which disrupts the flow and is grammatically incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after 'And however' to separate it from the rest of the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'sought an advanced degree' instead of 'decided to go for further studies' which changes the meaning.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned your husband wanted to polish his English, and does it mean that he wanted to seek an advanced degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'polish his English' instead of 'seek an advanced degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he wanted to seek an advanced degree which is about TESOL. So my husband have a distance learning program, which is provided by… which is taught from California, America, and had a distance learning program. And he only has to learn on distance learning and do not have to come to America. In this way, after all the credits he got from the distance learning program, he can get a master degree and after gets a master degree, he can be an English teacher and teachs English in Taiwan.

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'husband' instead of 'he'
cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	misinterpreting the intention of the original text

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with in this adultery case?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
My husband and the person he has an affair with is his colleague. Because the distance learning program have an arrangement of both… Chinese and foreign teacher. And in the distance learning program, they are colleague and have to partner with each other.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have affairs and beyond co-worker’s relationship?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of '外遇' as 'affairs'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
so, did you find any unusual messages in his cellphone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'did' before the subject 'you' instead of after.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In my husband’s phone book, there is always the same phone number, so I found it stranger and I checked his message. I found he always has messages with the same woman every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of what they found in their husband's phone book and messages.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide any context or background information about their suspicion or concern.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
And even though he always has text message with the same woman, does it… why would you think it’s strange? It seems fine. Or did you see any strange message in her cellphone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If the message is just some common words, and I won’t find something strange, and will prosecute adultery case. and it is because the message is very intimate, and just before today’s proceeding, I had provided some of the messages to the judge, and I think all the contents are in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the text.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the critical context of providing the messages to the judge.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Exhibit evidence1 and page 13: here is the message content that your wife provided to the court, and the defendant you can check whether the message content is true.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些是在我手機裡面的簡訊內容。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
well, so I will ask you some details in these messages. And the first message, the time is on December 21st, 2018. And the time is at 9:50 pm. The phone number is 0958932123. This phone number sent a message to your cellphone, and the contents of the message is 我非常想你. So what’s your plea? What’s your reaction to this intimate message?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那是我一個同事傳給我的訊息，那當時我放了兩天假，因為我的同事很擔心，所以他傳了這封訊息給我。我的同事是在美國長大的，所以她是非常心胸寬大的，他講話一直都是這麼直接這樣子如此，那我們兩個在稱呼彼此親近的人的時候，會直接稱我的寶貝、我的愛。我們一直都是用這樣的說詞，所以我並不覺得有任何的不妥。
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	adding unnecessary information
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
so what you mean is that the people who sent the message…because she has stayed in the foreign countries for several years, so her thought is westernized, and she is kind of open-minded. So even she said my love to you don’t have any other special meanings?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love to you' instead of 'my love'.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user fails to understand the cultural significance of the phrase '我的愛' and its meaning in the context.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
哦對啊，這並沒有任何的意義，這只是我們對於親近的朋友，關心的說詞而已，表達我們是好朋友、彼此關心的意思。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user translates it as 'Oh, right, this doesn't mean anything, it's just a phrase we use for close friends, expressing that we are good friends and care for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
So what about the previous message she just sent to you? I really missed you, this sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
正如同我剛剛所說過的，那是因為她擔心我，我們彼此是夥伴關係，那當時我請了兩天假，她自然而來會關心我，所以才發了這則訊息給我、表達他的關心。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added unnecessary information

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Well, so you mean that it is just because you had two days off, and do not go to work, and because she is your partner in the distance learning program, without you she has no assistance, so she sent this message to you, it’s that right?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，所以這個訊息就是這樣子來的，這並沒有什麼了不起、很特別或是很奇怪的事情。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about the message not being a big deal.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'no big deal' as '沒有什麼了不起、很特別或是很奇怪的事情', which does not convey the same meaning.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Let’s move to the exhibit evidence two. The message happened at 11:55pm, on December 29th on 2017. And the message is also sent from the same phone number, and the content is 我想要在你身旁，我們什麼時候才可以再一起呢？ So I want to by your side, and when we can truly be together? So what does it mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I want you by my side' as '我想要在你身旁' is incorrect. The correct translation should be '我想要你在我身旁'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們什麼時候才可以再一起呢？' instead of '我們什麼時候才可以再一起呢？'.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
當時她是想學著如何用中文來表達意思，所以她傳了這封訊息給我？
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
so you mean that she, your colleague, sent this message to you, and the purpose is to help you do the homework. So what does it mean, I don’t really know…I don’t really get you.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the meaning of the original text

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
當我老婆有起訴我們通姦這件事的時候，我正在修遠距課程，並想要得到碩士學位，在這個課程當中，我需要修30學分。那自然地，為了完成這30個學分，我必須完成一些作業跟練習，那我的夥伴就協助我完成這些作業。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by introducing the topic of adultery and mentioning a partner helping with assignments, which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in several sentences.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the information about completing assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
I want to ask…so what do you really study in your master program? I don’t understand, can you explain to me?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the assistant's master program.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是關於英語教學。那裡面就有關於英語教學、以及文化相關以及語言能力的培訓。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the specific mention of courses in the program.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation does not mention that some courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation uses '碩士學位' (master's degree) instead of 'program' to refer to TESOL.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So what you mean is that the TESOL that you studied in your master program, and in the master program, it contains some of courses about culture and communication, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the meaning of 'contains'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of 'TESOL'

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，然後我記得在這個碩士學位當中，有三堂課是關於文化以及溝通的課程。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the master's degree in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在這個碩士學位當中' (in this master's degree) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '我記得' (I remember).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'related to culture and communication' as '關於文化以及溝通的課程' (courses about culture and communication) instead of '文化和溝通相關' (related to culture and communication).

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So the courses about culture and communication, what’s the common assignment that the teacher will assign you?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
在這些文化課程當中，每個人的作業都會依照每個人在讀這個碩士學位的目的而有改變。那像我呢，我在讀這個碩士學位，是想要得到之後能在台灣教英文，因此我必須要展現我對中文有優秀的掌握能力。也是因為這樣，所以我的作業很多都是關於中文跟英文句子的翻譯。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean that because you plan to teach English in Taiwan, and you have to show that you has a good command of Chinese, so in order to complete your assignment, you have to translate the English sentence into Chinese, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of completing assignments as part of the course requirements.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'has' before the subject 'you' in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'prove' as 'show' instead of 'demonstrate'.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，此外我還需要去磨練我的口說以及寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, let’s move back to the exhibit evidence two, the message. Do you mean that this message is one of your assignments?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，這就是我當時的作業，我記得當初我看到這句話中文的時候，其實我並不了解它的意思，畢竟中文很多用字對外國人來說是很難了解的，因為我不懂，所以我去找我的partner幫忙，請他幫忙把這句話翻成英文，再把答案傳給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of asking the colleague to translate the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '當初' (initially) after the verb '記得' (remember), which is incorrect in English.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'partner' instead of 'colleague' to translate '我的partner'.
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user did not include any greetings or polite expressions in the translation.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Well, so that sentence, I want to by your side, kind of this sentence, is the situation just you wanted her to translate the Chinese sentence, and at that time, you asked her to send the correct answer to you. So it’s the total situation at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
是的，那句話就只是我作業的解答而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the homework assignment.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
The defendant, let’s move to the exhibit evidence one, page 14 to16. Please… so now you can browse all the messages in this evidence, so you mean that all the messages are part of your assignments?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's request for help in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'let's move to the exhibit evidence one' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '因為要做作業' as 'part of your assignments' instead of 'because you were doing homework'.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，這些訊息都是為了完成作業，才有這些訊息。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about what the messages were for.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
and your wife just said that you and your colleague have the adultery, and what do you want to explain?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
關於外遇這件事，我覺得一直以來都是我老婆想太多。我知道我在這個家庭中，我其實沒辦法支撐家庭的很多重擔，不過在這個課程當中，我的太太就也沒有…從我的課程開始到現在，我的妻子也沒有給我任何的協助。在我上碩士課程當中，我太太一直都不願意來協助我完成任何作業，要不是他這樣子不支持我，我也不需要請求我的中文夥伴來協助我，所以我覺得現在發生的一切，都不能怪到我頭上。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation completely changes the topic from the wife's dissatisfaction with the husband's ability to support the family to an extramarital affair.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has several word order errors that make the sentences unclear and confusing.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation omits the critical context of the wife's lack of support for the husband's education.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, it seems that you and your wife have something unhappy and do not get along well with your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們剛結婚的時候，我們確實過得很幸福、也很開心，但是呢後來的問題就開始出現了，因為我在台灣教的是葡萄牙文，那工作的時數不穩定，也沒辦法帶來穩定的收入，所以我們就開始出現了狀況。在此之後，我們針對就業工作這件事情，我們時不時的在爭吵同件事，她並不相信我的努力跟堅持，我也不知道如何讓他了解我所面對的挫折跟困難之處。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Well, let’s move back to your master program. Until now, do you still study in the master program? And when will you get the degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2016年四月開始讀這個碩士學位，那照理來說這個課程需要兩年，那原則上我應該在2017年五月完成。因為我一直沒有穩定的工作，所以沒有足夠時間唸書，所以我後來就放棄這個學位。正如我剛剛所說的，在我讀碩士學位的過程中，我的太太完全沒有支持我，我在讀書過程完全都是靠我自己，過程中我覺得很疲累、很挫折，我不知道該怎麼辦。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
you just mentioned the degree program… the period is two years, and you don’t complete the program, and I want to know the reason that you failed the program.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the degree program in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect in the sentence 'the period is two years'. It should be 'the program is two years'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question word 'why' in their translation.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成所有在課程上要求的作業，還有其中一些課程的要求。

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
so in the last semester that you registered, and when did the semester end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我在學註冊的最後一個學期，最後是在2017年春天。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'registration' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '在2017年春天' at the end of the sentence instead of after '最後一個學期'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If all the things are just as you stated, the course should be end at May, 2017. And after you finished and stopped the program, you wouldn’t have any assignments. However, you still had text messages with your colleague after the course ends, and the period is for seven months, and what’s your explanation?

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然我沒辦法完成我的碩士學位，但不代表我不想要改善我的中文能力，因此在我結束這個課程之後，我就靠自己想要改善我的中摁能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean even though you didn’t finish the master program, you still wants to improve your Chinese, and wants your Chinese become influent, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是為什麼我找我的女同事幫忙我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '我' (I) at the end of the sentence instead of at the beginning.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
so, … your colleague kind of plays the role of your tutor?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
對我來說，她所扮演的角色並不單單只是家教，更是我的好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
And did you pay money to your colleague for her teaching?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我有說想付她錢，可是她沒有接受
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'offered' in the translation.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If she is not your tutor, and you do not pay her money, why did she work so hard, and at midnight, is the time that she go to bed, she still sent the messages to you. And the content of the message seems to beyond the co-worker’s relationship.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text and changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order and lacks clarity.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是我為什麼說她真的是我很好的朋友，他都會在空閑時間幫助我，協助我精進中文能力

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Did you still teach English in the school?

Yes, I am still working there.
是的我現在還在那邊工作
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
And this colleague is still work in the school now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，她現在也在那個地方工作，不過我們現在不是同事關係，也沒有一起合作到。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不過我們現在不是同事關係，也沒有一起合作了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
rosecutor, do you need to subpoena anyone that can help you investigate the case or investigate any evidence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena the defendant’s colleague, Rong Er Huang. And I want her to act as an witness and help the court to clarify all situations and all the background and the purposes of these messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's colleague's job at Meimei Tutorial Center.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide any context or explanation for why the defendant's colleague's testimony is important.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' before the object 'the defendant's colleague', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'subpoena' instead of 'summon' to request the defendant's colleague's presence in court.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you want the prosecutor investigate any evidence for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'the accuser' after the verb 'do you want', which is incorrect.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard the cram school they worked in,… I heard that the cram school just took some action, and they intended to persuade the colleague Huang Rong Er to quit the job. So I want to confirm with the cram school and clarify the situation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention the relationship between the two individuals involved.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the intention of the cram school to persuade Huang Rong Er to quit the job, which was not mentioned in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you want the court to investigate for you any further evidence? The current situation is that you have finished your master program in May, 2017. There is no reason that you make up reasons for finishing the assignments and sent messages with your colleague Huang Rong Er. And especially the time you two sent messages is almost after 9pm, it’s very possible for people to think there is a strange relationship between you and do you have any evidence that can help you clarify all the situation in this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'There is no reason that you make up reasons for finishing the assignments and sent messages with your colleague Huang Rong Er.' The correct word order should be: 'There is no reason for you to make up reasons for finishing the assignments and sending messages with your colleague Huang Rong Er.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after the introductory phrase 'The defendant' in the beginning of the sentence.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我實在想不到任何可以就我的立場幫我調查的事情。就如同我剛才所說，我們傳訊息這件事情非常簡單，只是單純我想要增進我的中文能力，然後我想要把中文學習的更好。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the…adultery case. The defendant wife accuse his husband Takayashi, for he find the intimate message in his husband’s cellphone. And his husband often find reasons for extra work, and moreover have the tele-conference with his co-workers, which is beyond the co-worker relationship.

Not guilty, of course.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today procedure, we are going to see the detail of the defendant and his co-worker’s message to see whether they have an affair that beyond the co-worker relationship.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical context of the procedure being a preparation procedure and the purpose of clarifying if there is an extramarital affair.

我明白

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user forgot to include a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
Me and my husband have been married for 4 years. We didn’t have any children.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Where did you get married? In Taiwan? Or in your husband’s country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan 4 years ago. He came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker being the wife.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'came' before the subject 'he', which is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '認識' as 'met' instead of 'know'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '我先生' which means 'my husband'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in a period between his jobs, is his job teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mention that he seek for an advance degree. Do you mean that is a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in the translation.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he want to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he need is an English teaching degree. He found a distance learning program in California. In that, he can have a distance learning in Taiwan, and he didn’t need to go to the America. After program, he can have the master degree, and he can teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship with he and his affair person?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They were co-workers in his cram-school. They are partnered with my husband.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they are having an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'they' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user translated the sentence in a different word order.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you see something strange in his phone

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I found a phone in his phone book. So I check the message about that phone call, and I found there are many intimate messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the phone number and the frequency of the messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even is the text it is okay…is the text no appropriate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it is the regular text, that okay. But he is married, why a married person have intimate messages with other woman in his phone? I have some evidence in the file of the court.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的簡訊' as 'regular text' instead of 'ordinary text'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '已婚的人' as 'married person' instead of 'married man'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing evidence to the court in the translation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Exhibition 1 page 13, is this message from your phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific content of the text messages.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的這些是在我手機裡的訊息。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '是的' (yes) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb '是' (to be).

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I would like to ask some question about this message. The first message was sent by number 0958-532123 on 9:50 p.m. December 21, 2017. It is the “ I really miss you, my love.” What that mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封簡訊是我同事寄給我的，我記得當時我請了2天的假，所以他才發那一的簡訊給我，我的同事在美國讀書的所以思想比較開放，至於親愛的這個詞只是我們表達對朋友的稱呼。

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that the person who send the message was studied in foreign, so she has westernized and express her emotion open mind. So the word she send ‘my love’ didn’t mean nothing?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
是的，那只是對她所關心的人都有的稱呼。
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural meaning of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
Then what about the previous one?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the previous sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我所說的，她只是很關心我而已，因為我當時請了2天的假，而我們是互相之間的夥伴。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you meant that she sent the message because you just didn’t go to school for two days?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對的就是那個意思，那簡訊沒什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent on the 11:55, December 29th 2017, the context is “I want you to be my side, when can we be truly together?’ What’s that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I want you by my side' as 'I want you to be my side', which changes the meaning.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳那簡訊給我是為了要告訴我要如何在中文句子中表達自己的情感。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'express a Chinese sentence' is not accurately translated.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So do you mean that she sent this message to help you with your homework? What was that meant?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我妻子所報告的，我正在攻讀一個碩士學位，而這個課程需要完成30學分，所以我自然會想要在平時所做練習。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what’s your master degree study for?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是英語教學，它其中最主要包含了語文教學，那它也有部分是包含了文化以及語言能力的部分。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So your program is a TESOL but it is include some cultural and language competence course?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'include' in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the word 'language' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得我至少選修了3門有關於跨文化溝通的課程。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of courses being related to culture.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '選修了' (selected) before the number '3門' (3 courses), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '跨文化溝通' (cross-cultural communication) instead of '文化與溝通' (culture and communication), which changes the meaning.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what’s the assignment of these cultural courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing question mark

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通的課程作業對每個人都不太一樣，以我為例，因為我在台灣，所以我的課程作業的目標是需要增進我的中文語言能力。因此我的作業多半是中英句子的翻譯。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '以我為例' (taking myself as an example) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'reach this goal' as '增進' (improve) instead of '達成' (achieve).
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate 'culture and communication courses' and 'assignments'.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So do you meant that those assignment for translate sentences in Chinese and English….have relationship with your tend teaching English in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the assignment, specifically that it involves translating sentences.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the critical context of the assignment, which is that it is part of a master's course and is meant to demonstrate the student's Chinese language proficiency.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence structure should be 'So, do you mean that these assignments for translating sentences in Chinese and English have a relationship with your intention to teach English in Taiwan?'

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，當然我也被要求了增進我的口說以及寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Then let’s focus on the sentence we mentioned. Is that your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的我記得當時我還不太理解一些中文句子的翻譯，所以我向我的同事請求幫忙，我把中文句子傳給她並希望她把它翻譯成英文句子給我看。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the specific sentence that was mentioned in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses different words that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Do you meant that she sent that message because you ask her for translate it in English, and that message was the answer of your homework?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user made a word order error in the translation.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
沒錯那封簡訊只是我作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '只是' (only) in the wrong position in the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
That’s start in exhibition 1, page 14 to 16. Is all this message is for your assignment? I mean all the content of this message the answer of your homework?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對的這些簡訊都來自幫我完成作業的人。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the details of who sent the messages and their purpose.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then what’s your plead for you have an affair with the other woman.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我太太只是想太多了，我知道她對我目前分擔家計的能力不太滿意，而我也希望法院知道她從一開始就不太支持我攻讀這個碩士學位。她也不太願意對我的課程上有所幫助，所以我才只好找我的同事完成這些作業，所以我認為她應該為這件事情負責。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'blamed' instead of 'responsible'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting social context	misunderstanding the dynamics of a marital relationship

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your explanation, you don’t have a happy marriage life between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
一開始我們相處得很愉快，但之後因為我的工作關係，因為我教葡萄牙文的關係，所以在台灣不太有穩定的工作時間，因此我的工作常常成了我們的爭吵議題，她不認為我真的盡了我的全力了而我也因此常常很受挫。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay. Let’s go back to your program of your master degree. When did it start? Did you finish your program?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年的秋天開始我的碩士課程的，這課程本來應該是要在2017年的5月結束的，但我沒有完成它，因為我必須在工作及學位間做選擇，而這碩士學位影響了我的工作。就像我說的，我妻子從來就不支持我，而我感到很孤獨很沮喪；來攻讀這個學位，因此我覺得我非常的疲倦。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mention that the program is set for 2 years. Why didn’t you finish that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我無法完成那些課堂作業，以及一些課程的必修。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So what is the last semester of your registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後註冊的一個學期是2017年的春天。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '的一個學期' (one semester)

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As your mention, your program is finished on May 2017. However, you continual connect with your co-worker. How did you explain that you have the assignment after you finished the program?

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
或許我沒完成那個學位，但這不代表說我不想精進我的中文能力，我依然非常想增進我的中文能力，因此我找同事來做這些練習。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even if didn’t finish that program, you still want to learn Chinese by yourself?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
沒錯，那就是我找我同事幫忙的原因。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the role of your colleague, co-worker is like your tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'co-worker' was translated as '家教' which means 'tutor', but it should be translated as '同事' which means 'colleague' or 'co-worker'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是個家教，而是我真心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the pronoun 'her' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我原本想要的，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我原本想要的，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you did not pay, why she response your answer in midnight when she is going to sleep? Is this relationship beyond your co-worker’s relationship?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我所說的，她是位非常支持我的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teaching English in that school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Are you still teaching English in that school?'

Yes, I am still working there.
是的我還在那邊工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is this colleague still works there?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'works' should agree with the singular subject 'colleague'.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any person you want to ask, or some exhibition you want to show?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena his colleague, 蓉兒黃, who works in 美而美 school. For the investigate the details, and background of those messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague's name, 黃蓉兒, in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the purpose of subpoenaing the colleague as a witness in the translation.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Accuser, did you need anything ant to investigate for?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical context of the question.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Accuser' after the verb 'did', resulting in incorrect word order.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the美而美school have took some action for my husband and蓉兒黃for their relationship. And I would like to hear the explanation of the school.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word '補習班' (school) in their translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context of the school trying to persuade 蓉兒黃 to resign.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The situation now is your program has ended in May 2017, and you don’t have any reason to contact with your colleague in December. And your message often sent in 9 p.m. It is weird for your relationship.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我並沒有任何法院需要調查的證據，就像我所說的，這些簡訊都只是我想用來增進中文能力的方法而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The court will have ask the details 4:30 p.m. June 24 2017…..

 我明白。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for an adultery case. The accuser’s name is Yu Han Wang. She accuses Edward who were in a cram school…She accuses because Edward not only has intimate message with his coworkers, but also find some reasons for working late in the cram school, also will have some tele-conferencing that is beyond their relationship of the coworkers. So, the accuser Yu Han Wang accuses Edward for adultery. The defendant, your wife sued you for adultery, what’s your plea?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the information that the accuser's husband's name is Edward Takayashi.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user fails to mention that the accuser found intimate messages in her husband's phone records.

omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user does not mention that the accuser has collected communication evidence that goes beyond normal coworker relations.

grammar and structure	tense errors	The user switches between present and past tense in the same sentence.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First I want to ask the accuser, how many years have you and your husband married? Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How many years have you and your husband been married?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for four years and we have none child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'we have' instead of 'we have'.
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after 'married for four years' to separate the introductory phrase.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the information about not having children.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
And did you married with your husband in Taiwan or at the broad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan for years ago. He came here to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past four years, your husband’s job in Taiwan is teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
Before we met, he was a Portuguese teacher and after we married he is still teaching Portuguese. However, learning Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan so there are one or two months period between jobs that he didn’t have student to teach. In order to make the income more stable, he wants to learn English. However English is not his mother tongue so he spent more time on this language and study it… and seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You have mentioned he decided to seek an advanced degree, is that mean he wants to study a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advanced degree' instead of 'study further'

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, he wants to teach English in Taiwan so the degree he gets is about the English teaching. He found an online learning which was located in the California USA, so he can use this distance learning to finish his degree. So after that he finished online-leaning he can get the master degree of the USA. He can find a job to teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
The cram school will have a Chinese teacher and a Western teacher and my husband and that girl are partners
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair with each other?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'each other' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'with each other' at the end of the sentence instead of after the verb 'have'.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
What did you see in the cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
After I checked his cellphone, I found that there is a same number in the phone book, so after that I checked his message and found that he send message with same woman almost every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of being curious about the content of the messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'I checked his messages' instead of 'I checked his message'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'send message' instead of 'exchange messages', which changes the meaning slightly.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even they text with each other…it’s fine? Or the content is not proper?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
I also want it is not an appropriate text, but he was married but still send some intimate messages with that woman. I have provided some investigation messages in the file, maybe there are in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the person in question is married and is sending intimate messages, while the user's translation only mentions that the person is married and sending messages, without specifying the intimate nature of the messages.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation omits the critical context of the original text, which is that the person in question is sending intimate messages despite being married. This omission changes the meaning and impact of the message.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Let’s look at the investigation page 13. It’s about the message. The defendant, please look at the message. Are the messages you send to others?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是地這些是我手機上的簡訊
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the word '是地' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '地' in the wrong position in the sentence.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
And I want to ask some questions about the messages. The first message is sent at 9:50 on December twenty-first 2017, from the phone number 0958932123 to your cellphone. And the content of message is “I really miss you”. So what is this mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封簡訊是我同事傳來的，那時候正好請…兩天沒有去上班，她是關心我，所以才傳這封簡訊，我的同事在美國受高等教育，她也是非常能接受新思想的人，至於說”my love”我的摯愛這個詞的話，是一種對關心的人表達的方式而已。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect translation for 'my love'
cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	misinterpreting the meaning of 'my love'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So what you mean is that your college is educated so she was westernized…so her…so…she will be more open-minded toward relationship. So “my dear love” is just a kind of concerning about you?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
那句話就是對老朋友表達關心的方式
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, while the user's translation simply states that it is a way to express care for old friends.

那她前面那句呢？
So how about the line?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific line that was mentioned in the original text.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就如同上面所述，她當時是非常擔心我，因為我們是工作上夥伴關係，她只是想要表達她的關心而已
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Since you have two days off the work, so she text you for…missing you to work each other and cooperate with each other and work, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對~那就是我想表達的意思，簡訊內其實沒甚麼大不了的
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'message' in the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was at 11:55 at night. It is on December 29th ,2017. And it is from the same cellphone… number of the cellphone. The message is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” So what’s this mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這封簡訊是要教我如何…用中文來表達…中文的一個作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the specific details of the assignment.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'express a Chinese sentence in my assignment'.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you have mentioned that she texts you this message is just to help you with this assignment? What’s this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我老婆在庭前所說，碩士學位是需要修滿30學分，除此之外還需要完成許多作業與題目
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the specific mention of 'exercises' in the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
 So would you please explain first, what’s the content of your master degree? What did you learn in it?

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我是先英語教學的碩士學位，她除了包含英語教學以外，還有關文化、有些語文能力的訓練
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you have achieved the master degree of TESOL… and your leaning has included the cross-cultural communication, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The translation misinterprets the meaning of 'cross-cultural communication'.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得三門課是有關文化與溝通的
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of 'at least' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '記得' (to remember) instead of '提到' (to mention), which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what’s the assignment of the course of culture and communication?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這門課的作業是因人而異的，舉一個例子，像我在台灣想成為英文老師，我是要展現對中文的能力，所以我的作業是以中英翻譯為主。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of culture and communication courses in their translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of the assignments being related to proving competence in Chinese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect in the sentence '我是要展現對中文的能力' (I am to show competence in Chinese).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '展現' (show) instead of '證明' (prove) in the sentence '我是要展現對中文的能力' (I am to show competence in Chinese).
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate 'culture and communication courses' in their translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean that you have to approve your Chinese ability. Due to the assignment, you have to translate many sentences into Chinese? Right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific assignments given in the course.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Due to the assignment, you have to translate many sentences into Chinese, right?'

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，除此之外還需要潤飾口說與寫作能力
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'required' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '需要' (need) before the noun '口說與寫作能力' (speaking and writing skills), which is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s go back to the context of the message. You said it’s your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，那是我作業的一部分，中文有許多困難的字，對初學外國人來講，所以我請求同事幫我翻譯再把答案傳給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So what you have said is that you asked your colleges to translate sentences so she translated into then sended to you. Is this the situation at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
簡訊的內容就只是我作業中的部分而已
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
So let’s look at page 14 to 16 about the investigation. The defendant, so know you can see all the messages. Are they all for the assignments? Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的這些簡訊都是為了尋求幫忙的內容
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So what’s your plea about your wife cused you having affair with colleague?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific accusation made by the wife.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'cused' instead of 'accused'.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
對我認為我太太是想太多的，我也知道她可能認為我，對於支持這個機庭並不是那麼盡責，但當時我在完成碩士學位期間她也沒有給予任何幫助，因為她之前沒有給予任何幫助，所以我才會去尋求同事的幫忙，而她也要為此負責任…為這次的誤會負責任
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your explanation, you have not a very good relationship with your wife?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們開始的婚姻其實還蠻美好的，後來變質的原因為我工作的緣故，我是教葡萄牙，但是工作並不是那麼穩定，後來由於工作的議題有許多的爭吵，她認為我沒有盡力…對於工作沒有盡力而為，但我其實有許多挫折與苦衷是沒有說出來的。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So let’s go back to your master degree. When is your master degree? Has it ended? Have you gotten the master degree yet?

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這個碩士課程是在2015四月開始的，為期兩年，應該要在2017年的五月結束，然而我沒有完成碩士學位，因為當時兼職了…做了很多打工而沒有完成作業，就像我說的，我太太在碩士學位研習沒有給予任何的幫助，所以我覺得我是獨自一人奮鬥，奮鬥道非常的淚雨很大的挫折感。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong term
cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	misinterpreting the tone

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You have mentioned the degree lasted for two years, and you didn’t finished, why is that?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the reason for not completing the degree.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我無法完成所有的作業，還有課堂上的特定要求
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out 'course assignments' and 'course requirement'

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When was your last semester of your last registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊最後一學期是2017年春天
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'registration' from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '2017年春天' at the end of the sentence instead of after '最後一學期'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you have mentioned, your last semester of course ended at 2017, so it is no reason that you’ll have assignment after the semester, and your colleagues still send you the translation of the assignment seven months after your last semester?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
並不是我沒有完成學位就代表我不想精進中文的能力，在課程之後我仍然自學中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of failing the program.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So what you mean is that even you didn’t get master degree, you still want to approve your Chinese ability, so you continue learning, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是我請同事幫助我的原因
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' from the translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'why' from the translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'asked' from the translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'my' from the translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' from the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleagues played a role like a tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'home tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教也是非常好的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay for her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the pronoun 'you' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
原本想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'I offered to pay her' instead of 'I wanted to pay her'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
So if you did not pay her the salaries，why did she have to send you messages at midnight? And this behavior is beyond co-worker’s relationship.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of not paying the salaries.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'the salaries' after 'her', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '不辭辛勞' as 'beyond co-worker's relationship', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是我之前說她是非常持我的朋友，她花費自己的時間讓我英文更好
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'Chinese' as '英文' which means 'English' instead of '中文' which means 'Chinese'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Did you teach English at that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'teach' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的我還是在那邊教書
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word '教書' which means 'teaching' in the translation.

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is this colleagues work there also?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她還在那邊工作，但我們已經不是合作得關係
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是合作得關係' instead of '但我們已經不是合作得關係'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have to…any person to subpoena or investigate any…
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of who the prosecutor needs to subpoena or investigate.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena the colleagues of named Ron Er Huang and as a witness to tell the court what’s the purpose of the texts and explain the texts as well.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant's colleague's name, Huang Rong Er, and the specific context of their relationship.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase 'colleagues of named Ron Er Huang'. It should be 'colleagues of Ron Er Huang'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user's translation does not include the term 'subpoena', which is essential for conveying the legal action being taken.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Accuser, do you have anything to investigate, the court may help you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the court's assistance in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Accuser' after the verb 'do' instead of before it.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has put some actions about the relationship between two people, and also persuade the person to resign her job. So I want to investigate this evidence to prove it’s right or not.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific actions taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the necessary context for the actions taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention the specific action of persuading the woman to resign her job.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the necessary context for the woman's decision to investigate the evidence.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have anything to investigate the court may help you? As your master degree ended at 2016, so that’s an excuse of your interaction with your colleagues, by sending texts mostly after nine pm, that is doubtable… Do you want to provide any evidence to prove that…your…you are not guilty.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'colleagues' instead of '黃蓉兒'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting 'excuse' as 'an excuse of'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating '案情' as 'case'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
對於庭上，我沒有想要庭上調查的事項，我們的關係真的是…很一般，我只是想要增進中文能力，並持續學中文而已
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court is set at 16:30 on April, June 22nd 2018, for asking the witness of the procedure. And all of you, the defendant, the accuser have to participate the court and you can hire a lawyer. Do you fully understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the date is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '107年6月24日' is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of the witness examination procedure.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The translation does not mention that both the plaintiff and the defendant should attend the court.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The translation does not mention that both parties can hire a defense lawyer if necessary.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The translation is missing a comma after 'all of you'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of 'the defendant, the accuser' is incorrect.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of 'the court and you can hire a lawyer' is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '明白嗎？' is incorrect.

 我明白。

請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
Prosecutor please describe the fact of the crime.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the request for the prosecutor to summarize the charges.

如起訴書所載。
As stated on the indictment.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the adultery case. The defendant’s wife Yu-Hen Wang is intend to accuse his..her husband because she finds in her husband cell phone that there were some intimate messages with her…his coworker. And that the accuser finds that her husband often come back home late from work, contacting with his coworker during midnight and the content of the conversation has gone beyond merely coworker relationship. The defendant, your wife has suspected that you have commit the crime of adultery. What is your plea?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	incorrect translation of 'accuse' as 'intend to accuse'
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	inaccurate translation of '你太太' as 'his...her wife'

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯，當然
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, we are going to ask the defendant the detail of his conversation with his coworker. So that we could determine  whether the defendant has committed the crime of adultery.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the critical detail of asking the defendant about his communication with his coworker.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation incorrectly states that the purpose is to determine if the defendant has committed the crime of adultery, while the original text only mentions clarifying if there is an extramarital affair.

我明白

I understand.

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, the accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have any kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
Me and my husband have been married for 4 years. We do not have any children.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Does you… do you marry with your husband in Taiwan? Or do you marry with your husband in foreign country?

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met 4 years age in Taiwan. He came to Taiwan primarily for teaching Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker being the wife.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '4 years ago' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'met'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'teaching' instead of 'learning' to describe the husband's purpose.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the previous years, his main job is teaching Portuguese, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, after we got married, he is still teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan. There are not many students waiting to learn Portuguese. So, his teaching hours is not that stable. Sometimes he wouldn’t have any classes for 1 or 2 months. After a while, he hoped that he could have a stable income. So he would like to teach English. However, English is not her native language. So he decides to go on further education and seeks for an advanced degree.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the husband's desire for a stable income.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the husband's decision to pursue further education.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'her' instead of 'his' when referring to the husband's native language.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he would like to seek for an advanced degree. Do you mean that he would like to study a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of studying in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he would like to teach English in Taiwan, so he would need to have a TESOL degree. He found a distanced learning program in California, so he do not have to go to United States to earn a degree. After the online program, he could receive a master degree and he planned that after earning the degree, he could find a teaching job in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then, what’s his relationship with this so-called adultery…adultery person?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the order of the words in the sentence

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They were colleague in cram school. Because in that cram school, they offer teacher both in Chinese and foreign country. They are partners.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they are committing adultery?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'committing' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'committing' before the subject 'they' instead of after.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So, do you see any unusual messages in the phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
There is a phone number that keep coming up all the time in his dialing record. And then I check his message box, I discovered that he has been messaging with the same girl all the time.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was curious and checked the messages.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the speaker checked the messages after being curious about the phone number.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'check' before the object 'his message box', which is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'dialing record' instead of 'communication record', which changes the meaning.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even is just texting… text message, it’s nothing. Are the text content inappropriate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it’s just regular texting, how come the text message is so intimate? Why a married person would text like that? I have submitted the text log to the court. I believe the contents are already in the folder.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Present Exhibit 1 page 13. The defendant, is this the message in your phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the content of the text messages.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些是在我手機裡的訊息。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '在' (in) after '手機' (cell phone) instead of before it.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then, I would like to ask some questions regarding these messages. The first message come from 9:50 P.M. 12/21, 2017 from the phone number 0958932123. The content of the message is “I really miss you, my love.” What does that even mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封簡訊是我同事傳給我的。我記得那時我請了兩天的假，因為她有點擔心，才傳了那樣的簡訊，我的同事在美國受教育，他思想比較開放，而至於”親愛的”這個詞呢，只是我們表達我們對於我們關心的人的一種方法。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of taking two days off from work.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of the colleague being concerned or worried.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague being educated in the US and being open-minded.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'my love' being a way to refer to people we care about.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '那封簡訊是我同事傳給我的' (That message was sent to me by my colleague) at the beginning of the sentence, which is not the correct word order in Chinese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我記得那時我請了兩天的假' (I remember at that time I took two days off) in the middle of the sentence, which disrupts the flow of the sentence.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '他思想比較開放' (he is open-minded) in the middle of the sentence, which disrupts the flow of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '而至於”親愛的”這個詞呢' (as for the term 'my love') in the middle of the sentence, which disrupts the flow of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '只是我們表達我們對於我們關心的人的一種方法' (it's just a way we express our care for people we care about) in the middle of the sentence, which disrupts the flow of the sentence.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that because your coworker is more westernize so that she is more open-minded so that she expressed her emotion in that way. The word “my love” does not have any special meaning.
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural nuances of the original text. The phrase '我的愛' is not simply a casual expression, but rather a term of endearment that carries a deeper meaning.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對的，這是好朋友之間或者是對關心的人所表達的一種方法。
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural meaning of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
Then, what about the previous sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，他只是比較擔心我而已，因為我當時請了兩天的假，而我們也是工作中非常要好的同事。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that because you just took two day off and that she express her concern to you on the work?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對的，那就是情境。這個簡訊沒有什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in the translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message came from 11:55 P.M. 12/29 2017 from the same message, same cell phone, with the same number. The content is “ I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What was that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他傳這個簡訊是告訴我如何用中文表達這樣的訊息。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that she sent this message is to help you with your own assignment. What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of the original text

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
正如我妻子所提到的，我正在修讀碩士學位，這個課程需要我完成30個學分，那麼當然的，這其中就包含了一些作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you please explain what your master degree is about?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Can' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'please' at the end of the sentence instead of before the verb 'explain'.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程主要是跟英語教學有關，其中包含了語文教學還有部分是跟文化以及語言能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific courses that were related to culture and language competence.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide enough context about the program and its courses.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence structure should be '其中包含了語文教學，還有部分是跟文化以及語言能力有關的課程。'

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So, you are study for TESOL program, and that the program constituted with some culture related courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'some' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'study' before the preposition 'for', which is incorrect in English.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '文化溝通' as 'culture related', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'cultural communication'.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得我至少是有三門課是和跨文化及溝通有關的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of courses.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '是有' in an unnatural position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '跨文化及溝通' to translate 'culture and communication', which is not an accurate translation.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What are the assignment for these so-called culture and communication courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing question mark

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通的課程的作業會依個人而定，像比方說，因為我在台灣所以我的課程會需要我能擁有良好的中文能力。因此，我的課程有很多跟作業有很多是關於中文英文句子之間的翻譯。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '因為我在台灣所以' (because I am in Taiwan)

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, do you mean that your course require you to have some Chinese ability so that you have the assignment of translating Chinese and English. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the assignment, specifically that it involves translating sentences.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'require' before the subject 'your course', resulting in incorrect word order.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the singular verb 'require' instead of the plural verb 'requires' to match the subject 'your course'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，沒有錯，當然，我也被要求要有精進我的口說以及聽力還有寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of listening skills.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Then, let’s go back to that sentence. You say this is your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的沒有錯。那個句子是我的作業。我記得我當時還不斷的理解一些中文字句的翻譯，所以我向我的同事請教。畢竟中文和英文的結構以及字非常不一樣。我把中文的句子傳給他，並且希望他能幫我把這個句子翻譯成英文。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was mentioned in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not in the correct order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'translate' instead of 'recognize', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	The user mentioned that some Chinese words can be difficult for foreigners to recognize, which implies humor or sarcasm, but this was not conveyed in the translation.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So do you...did you mean that you send the Chinese sentence to your coworker and the coworker help you translate it in English and send it to you? So the message is just only for homework. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'that one sentence in Chinese' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect in the sentence 'So do you...did you mean'.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
是的，那個訊息僅僅是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Ok. Then let’s go to Exhibit one, page fourteen to sixteen. So, are these all messages for your homework? Please take a look.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'Exhibit one' in their translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of 'messages' in their translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'for your homework' in their translation.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些所有簡訊都是為了幫助我完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then, what’s your explanation toward your wife’s claim of you having an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我的太太只是想太多了，我知道他對我不能協助分擔家計感到不滿。而我希望法院可以知道，他從一開始就不支持我工讀我的碩士學位。因為他不支持我，所以我才必須問我同事這些課程上的問題。所以我覺得，這個整起誤會的責任在他身上而不是我。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, there are some issue between your relationship with your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
一開始我們相處得非常好，但之後因為我的工作遇到了一些問題，在台灣葡萄牙語的教學時間並不是非常穩定。因此我們的工作造成了我們之間一些爭吵的原因。他不認為我有付出足夠的努力來找工作。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
OK. Let’s go back to your master degree program. So do you finish the program? Have you received the degree yet?

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年的秋天開始了這個課程。這個課程為時兩年，我應該在2017年的五月取得了我的學位，但是我並沒有完成我的學位。因為我必須時常做兼職工作。因此這影響了我的我的讀書時間。就像我說的，我妻子並不支持我攻讀這個學位，我只能孤身一人的攻讀個學位，漸漸的我感到非常的勞累及挫折。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mentioned that the program is for two yearlong but you did not finish the program. Why...why did you do not complete your program
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我無法完成所有的課堂作業以及一些課程的畢業要求。

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So what… What’s your last registration date?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後註冊的時間是2017年春天。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '時間' (time) which is not in the original text

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you stated, the last...the program finish on May 2017; however, you continue have texted message with your coworker. What do you explain that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我結束了我的課程，並不代表我放棄精進我的中文能力，我仍然非常想精進我的中文能力，所以我才持續的傳送這些訊息。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	adding unnecessary information

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Are you saying that even you did not finish the program, you still want to enhance your Chinese ability?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the meaning of the original text

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，因此我才會尋求我同事的協助。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'why' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the role of your colleague is like your tutor, correct?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'private tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅僅是我的家教，而且還是我一個好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject 'you' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我原本想要付錢給他，但是他拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我原本想要付錢給她' instead of '我原本想要付錢給他'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' is used in the translation instead of '她', which changes the gender of the person being referred to.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you did not pay her, then how come she reply your message in the middle of night? Does that has formed a relationship beyond merely coworker?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我說他是一個非常支持我的朋友，他用他自己的時間來協助我學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still teaching in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'English' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的我仍然在那裏工作
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'there' in the translation.

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does this colleague still working there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的她仍然在那裏工作，但我們不再是工作上的搭檔
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們不再是工作上的搭檔' instead of '但我們不再是搭檔工作上的'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any evidence would like to investigate or would like to summon any other witness?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope that we could summon the defendant’s colleague 蓉兒黃 to understand what’s her relationship with the defendant, and the content of the message.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the colleague's workplace, which is important for understanding the context of the text.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have any other evidence that you would like the court to help you investigate?

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has taken some actions between the relationships of my husband and 蓉兒黃. They even ask 蓉兒華 to leave her job. I would like the court to help me investigate whether this is true or not.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word '美而美' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the order of '蓉兒黃' and '華' in the translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user mistranslated '黃蓉兒' as 'my husband' instead of '蓉兒黃'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'the court'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user added the phrase 'I would like the court to help me investigate whether this is true or not' which is not present in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence that would like the court to help you investigate to? The situation now is that you have finished your master program in May 2017. So that it is highly unlikely that you ask your colleague to help you with your assignment. And also the text message were sent during midnight, this raise suspicious… a suspicion on your relationship with your coworker.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'colleague' instead of '黃蓉兒'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting '疑竇' as 'suspicion'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我並沒有任何證據希望法庭為我調查，就如我所說的，我和我的同事只是好朋友，這些簡訊只是我為了精進我的中文所傳送。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory case of an adultery case. The accuser, Wang Yu Han. She filed the sue against the defendant, Edward Takayashi. The defendant was charged with having an intimate message with his employee in the cram school. And the accuser also found some intimate message through his cellphone while the defendant was having a night shift and also have a video tele-conferencing with ZonER- Huang.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory case, we are here to discuss….talk about the detail about the defendant and his employee of the…. We are having to discuss the.. whether the person has an affair with the others. Do you two understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

我明白

是我瞭解了.

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, the accuser, do you have the child with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for four years. But we don’t have the child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'have been married' instead of 'have married'.
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	The period at the end of the sentence is missing.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The phrase '小孩' should be translated as 'children' instead of 'the child' to indicate the possibility of having more than one child.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
So, did you marry your husband in Taiwan, or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about how they met in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'each other' after the verb 'met' instead of before.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'for teaching' instead of 'to teach', which changes the meaning.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past years, does your husband teach Portuguese as his work?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met the first time, he was a Portuguese teacher. And he has keep teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese isn’t a popular language in Taiwan, and…so the teaching hours are usually short, and there are periods between jobs. In order to earn a stable living, he started to learn English in Taiwan, since his mother tongue isn’t English, so he choose to seek an advanced degree.

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
Do you mean that he wants to earn a degree in Taiwan? And get a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of studying in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wants to teach English. So the degree he gets is to …for English teaching. My husband found…that..found a distance learning program in California, it’s an online learning, he doesn’t need to go to there for learning. After he gets all the credits, then he can get a master degree. What he is planning is to have an American degree, so that he can has a qualification for English teaching in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'So the degree he gets is to …for English teaching.'

omission or addition	omission of details	omission of the specific details about the credits required for the master degree
omission or addition	omission of details	omission of the specific details about the qualification for English teaching in Taiwan

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So, what the relationship between the person he has an affair with this time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are the co-workers in the cram school, there will be a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher, so they can cooperate with each other in the… in class. The person he has an affair with was a Chinese teacher.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'affair' instead of 'colleague'

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'did' before the subject 'you' instead of after.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I was suspecting and ask him why he had to have a night shift after the school? Because it’s just an American cram school, and he has to cooperate with the Chinese teacher, so they had to have the further communication on teaching. At first, I didn’t suspect that… anything about him, but ….when he was having a phone call in….at home, he wouldn’t talk in front me, but he choose to talk through the phone in his… study room….instead.

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'suspecting' instead of 'noticing'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So did you found anything strange in his cellphone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'anything' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'found' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
And I checked through his phone book, and I saw there was a same number, then I checked his phone message, and I found that he was messaging with a girl he chatted every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the curiosity that led them to check the phone messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'there was a same number' in an unnatural word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'chatted' instead of 'messaged', which changes the meaning slightly.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even though…. It was a…. Even though, texting messages is not..doesn’t have anything wrong or are there any something weird during the communication?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
So it’s just a regular message, but however there are..they have some intimate messages between each other, and I have files some intimate messages to the court. Maybe it’s inside the file already.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please show the exhibit 1 of Page 13. The defendant, please see the content, are these the one on your phone?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機裡的訊息內容。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'messages' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'were'.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then, I will ask you some questions with these messages. The first message, it was sent at 9:50, December 21st, 2017, the phone number was 0958932123. It was sent to your… the message was sent to your cellphone, and it was written “I really miss you very much”, 我非常想念妳。….親愛的，我非常想念妳。 what does that mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'my love' as 'very much'
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversal of subject and verb in '我非常想念妳'
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	addition of '親愛的' (dear)

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那是我同事…我同事發給我的，那天我請兩天的假，那是我朋友非常緊張有焦慮的事情。那是我…她是在美國接受教育的，所以她是一個非常開放，然後她思想開放，很勇於表達她自己想法的人，那封訊息內容，I really miss you so much, my love. 那只是她.. 我們互相表達關愛的方式。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that the girl was educated in foreign country? So she is westernized, and what she expressed is open-minded, and the message” I really miss you so much” is how she expressed her care?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿。那是朋友之間表達關心的方式。或是更好朋友之間互相表達的關心
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '那是朋友之間表達關心的方式' does not capture the idea of 'a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
So how about the previous message?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the previous message.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，她是來….她是傳簡訊來問我東西。我那天請兩天假，所以她有點想念我
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the woman was worried about the speaker.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context that the woman and the speaker are partners at work.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the woman missed the speaker when they were away for two days.
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	The user added unnecessary information about the woman sending text messages to ask about something.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So you mean that …since you have seem just drop two days from your work, and she messaged you that she really missed you a lot. Which means she wanted you a help for her, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，這就是那個..這內容所要表達的。那並沒有什麼。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'The message' which is a critical detail in the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent at 23:55. December 29th, 2017. And it was sent by the same person. The message was written” 我想要你在我旁邊，我們什麼時候可以在一起？” What does that mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I want you by my side' as '我想要你在我旁邊' is accurate, but the translation of 'when can we be truly together?' as '我們什麼時候可以在一起？' is not accurate. The original text implies a desire for a deeper level of togetherness, while the translation simply asks when they can be together.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳的那則簡訊，是要問我說要怎麼在中文怎麼表達豐富的情感。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed in the translation.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that she sent you the message just for…just asking help with her work?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我之前跟法庭所說的，我現在有那個碩士學位要修，而且有30學分去完成這個學位。正常來說，我有功課，我一定有功課要做，所以這就是我當時我要所提問的問題
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about completing assignments and exercises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you further explain, what are you studying in your Master program?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'further' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'explain', resulting in incorrect word order.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是屬於英語教學，除了英語的教學之外，還有那個…文化上跟語言能力的課程。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you mean that you are getting a mater degree for TESOL, and there are some cultural communication inside the course right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得有至少三門課程是有關文化溝通的課程。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the courses.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '課程' (courses) instead of '課程' (related to) in the translation, which changes the meaning.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what are the assignments for the cultural and communication?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
文化溝通不只是就是增加我的經驗之外，還有爭取教學的工作在台灣，除了當一個老師要有一個目標之外，還要一個有語言能力在中文上。所以我的作業有很多是有關中英上的翻譯。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '增加我的經驗之外'
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '還有'
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '爭取教學的工作'
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '在台灣'
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '除了當一個老師要有一個目標之外'
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '還要一個有語言能力在中文上'

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean that you want to…you plan to teach English in Taiwan, but you have to get a master degree, and there are courses about Chinese. So the assignments you are assigned are translating the sentences right? In Chinese and English right?

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，我同時還要精進我的口說跟寫作能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'required' in their translation.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So that go back to the words, are these your assignments?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對的。那的確是我的，我之前在學中文所翻譯到的句子。你知道吧，對外國人來說，有些中文句子的確很難分辨。那剛好那個句子我就請我同事翻成中文給我看….請她翻成英文給我看。然後再請她傳送我過來。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of asking the colleague to translate the sentence into Chinese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'translate' before the object 'that sentence' instead of after it.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'translate into Chinese' instead of 'translate into English'.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you mean that ask your colleague to send the message into English to you. And those sentences of messages in English was just your assignments?

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那句話就只是我作業中的一個中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the message being an answer to homework.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
So the defendant, please see the Exhibit 1, P.14-16. As we see the message context Are these all context were the assignments was for seeking help with your homework?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的。這些都是我要拿來做功課做作業用的
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, what’s your explanation about the… about your wife filing the sue against you for…you are having an affair with other?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'filing the sue' instead of 'filing a lawsuit'
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	lack of appropriate greeting or introduction

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我覺得太太真的有點對此太焦慮了。我知道她其實並沒有對我感到對我照顧這個家庭感到很滿意，從我一開始要唸碩士學位的時候，她就沒有支持我。如果在她一開始支持我的攻讀進修的話，我就不需要尋求我同事的幫忙了。所以她應該要為這一整件的誤會付起最大的責任吧。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'thinks too much' as '太焦慮了' which means 'too anxious' instead of 'overestimates'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb '真的' after the verb '覺得' instead of before it.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'of supporting the family' in the sentence 'she is not satisfied with my ability'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of the speaker asking their colleague for help.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '最大的責任吧' which means 'the biggest responsibility' at the end of the sentence.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your words, there seem to be some dis….between your both?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
一開始我跟我太太結婚其實相處蠻愉快的，但問題出現在我要開始找工作，因為我當時要教葡萄牙文，但是我並沒有辦法拿到任何授課時數。所以因為這樣子我已經跟我太太吵了很多次了。她就是不相信我在這教學上做的努力，她也不知道我其實在教學上面臨了許多的挫折。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, let’s go back to your master course. Are you finish with your courses, or still keep going?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我從2015年的秋天開始進行我兩年制的課程。原計畫是訂定在 2017年五月完成我碩士學位。但是因為我的打工因素，還有我作業沒有辦法完成。所以我就沒有拿到碩士學位。就像我說的，我太太並沒有支持我，我感覺像我自己一個人在追求這個學位，我真的感到很累也感到非常的挫折。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that the courses was for two-year program, but you didn’t finish. Why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒有辦法完成所有課程的功課。那還有一些課程的必修我也沒有辦法完成。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'course assignments' and 'course requirement' in their translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So, what is your finish date for the registering your…courses?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊在學的最後一個學期是在2017春天的時候。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
Like you said, you should finish your courses on May, 2017. And there will be no assignments for your courses. However, you have been texting messages with your colleagues for seven months after you finish your courses.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我今天沒有完成我的課程。我還是想要增加我的…精進我的中文能力。所以我就還是有持續自己在自學，然後就都會詢問有中文上的困
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就算我今天沒有完成我的課程，我還是想要增加我的中文能力。'

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '精進' is not the correct translation for 'improve'. The correct word should be '提升' or '改善'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'Even when I failed the program' in their translation.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that even though you didn’t finish your Chinese courses, you still want to enhance your Chinese ability, is that right?

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是為什麼我尋求我同事的幫忙
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague is just like a tutor teaching you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，也是我真心地朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay for her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the pronoun 'you' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'did' instead of 'have' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有耶，我本來想要付錢給她但她拒絕了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'No' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '沒有耶' (No) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she texting you during the midnight, and it’s not the right time, isn’t that beyond the co-worker’s relationship?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她真的是我的好朋友。她都利用她所有的花時間來幫助我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '她利用她所有的時間' instead of '她都利用她所有的花時間'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school？
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'still' at the end of the sentence instead of before the verb 'teach'.

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the cram school in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'in that cram school' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'working with you'.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她還是在那裡工作，但我們並沒有再合作了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們並沒有再合作了' instead of '但我們並沒有再合作了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have anyone to subpoena, or anything to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena the witness which means the colleague… the defendant’s colleague to the court. I want her to be the witness of the background and the message, and explain the context
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the witness's name and the name of the tutoring center.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'which means the colleague' in an incorrect position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'subpoena' instead of 'request' or 'summon' to convey the idea of calling the witness to court.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you want the court to help you subpoena anyone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of any specific evidence or witnesses that the accuser wants the court to help subpoena.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the Mei-Er-Mei Cram School has taken some actions, one of these is to let Zong-Er Huang to get off …. to leave her work. I would like to subpoena the principle for the… to respond this message.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the actions taken by the Mei-Er-Mei Cram School.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Zong-Er Huang' before the verb 'to get off', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the context of why Zong-Er Huang was asked to leave her work.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence about the actions taken by the Mei-Er-Mei Cram School.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase 'I would like to subpoena the principle for the... to respond this message', which is not present in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you want the court to help you investigate any evidence? The defendant, your master courses have ended in May, 2017. However, the action between you and your colleague is beyond co-worker’s relationship. And it’s weird that to text the messages after 9:00 p.m. just for asking for the….having with the assignments, do you have any evidence to…for the court to investigate? And verify your suspicion?

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
基本上，我沒有要法院再進一步調查的證據了。我跟我同事真的就是單純之間的朋友互動。我就只是想要增進我的中文而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the communication between the user and their colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '真的就是單純之間的朋友互動' in the wrong position in the sentence.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the next proceeding will be set on June 24th, 2018. The time is 4:30p.m. We are going to have a witness questioning procedure. For both parties, you have to be here, and you can have your own lawyers. Do you understand?

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of adultery case. The accuser is Yu-Han Wang. She filed a lawsuit against the defendant Edward Takayashi. He works in a cram school. He had some intimate messages with his coworker Rong-Er Wang. The defendant often worked overtime… He often made up a reason working overtime and he even had some tele-conferencing with Rong-Er Wang. They had beyond coworker’s relationship.The defendant, the accuser Yu-Han Wang filed a lawsuit against you for adultery. What’s your pledge?

omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase 'They had beyond coworker’s relationship' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not accurate. For example, 'The defendant, the accuser Yu-Han Wang filed a lawsuit against you for adultery' should be 'The defendant, Yu-Han Wang, the accuser, filed a lawsuit against you for adultery'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after the defendant's name in the sentence 'The defendant Edward Takayashi'.
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	The user used 'the' before 'preparatory procedure' and 'adultery case' when it should be 'a'.
grammar and structure	repetition of phrases	The user repeated the phrase 'He often' in the sentence 'He often made up a reason working overtime and he even had some tele-conferencing with Rong-Er Wang.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'tele-conferencing' instead of 'video call' or 'video chat'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '從往過密' as 'had some intimate messages' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long you have been married with your husband? Do you have child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married with your husband?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun 'you' should be used instead of 'the accuser'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The question does not include the part about having children.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years. We don’t have any child.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'husband' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the plural form 'we' with the singular verb 'don't'. It should be 'we don't have any children'.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
You two got married in Taiwan or in other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. He wanted to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker being married to the person they met in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'wanted' before the subject 'he', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '認識' as 'met each other' instead of 'got to know'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the last four years, he was always teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met each other, he was a teacher teaching Portuguese. Now he is still teaching.Because not many people really want to learn Portuguese in Taiwan, his teaching hours are not stable. There is even a period of one to two months between jobs.To have a more stable income, he wants to teach English but he… his mother tongue is not English so he decided to seek advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he wants to seek advanced degree. Does he want to seek a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English so he needed to seek a degree of English teaching.He found a distance learning program of … in California in US. So he can learn English through distance learning. So he can get the degree just through distance learning and he can have the US degree to teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between he and the person he has affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'What's the relationship between him and the person he has an affair with?'
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are coworkers in cram school. There is a rule in cram school that a Chinese teacher has to partner with a foreign teacher, so the person he has affair with is his partner.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '同事' as 'person he has affair with' instead of 'coworker'.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'did' before the subject 'you' instead of after.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, he just often worked overtime. I asked him it’s just an English cram school, why did you need to work overtime. He said he had to communicate with the Chinese teacher to prepare the courses.I did not doubt him at first but he gradually… uhh.. when he went home, he always got some phone calls and he did not answer the phone calls in front of him. He always picked up the phones in study room so I started to doubt him and I check his phone.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the husband stays at the school after work.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'just' in the wrong position in the sentence.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the context that the wife checked her husband's phone because of her suspicions.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything wrong in his phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'unusual' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
He often called the same person and he sent messengers with the same one almost every single day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about checking the text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'sent' before the noun 'messengers', which is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'called' instead of 'sent messengers', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
I think it’s fine with the messages? Or the messages are inappropriate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
I am fine with the normal messages but the contents are too intimate and I have given some of the messages to the court. I think the messages are attached to the file.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not accurately translate the phrase '在卷夾裡面了' which means 'attached to the file'.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Exhibit one, page 13, the records of the messages. The defendant, please check the exhibition. Are they messages in your phone?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
對，這是我手機裡的簡訊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I’m going to ask questions according to the messages in your phone.The first message was sent at 9:50pm on Dec 21st, 2017. It was from 0958-932123. The content is “I really miss you, my love.” What does it mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事發給的，因為那時候我休假兩天，她有點擔心，所有才有這個簡訊。我的同事在美國念書，她講話比較開放，那就是她表達方式，至於my love，那就是我們稱呼我們在乎的人的方式。

omission or addition	omission of details	incorporating superfluous words or phrases
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that because the person who sent you the message is educated in a foreign county, she is more open-minded. So “my love” doesn’t mean anything. Right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its cultural connotations.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿，這就是一個很普通的稱呼方式。好朋友之間就這樣。
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural significance of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
what about the previous message?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我說了，那就是她關心我的話而已。我們是工作上的搭檔，所以她關心我也很正常。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the part about the speaker being away for two days.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean that because you took two days off, she didn’t have the assistance during the classes so she sent that kind od message to you?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對，所以才有那樣的簡訊，沒有什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of '簡訊' (message) in their translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent at 11:55pm on Dec 29th, 2017. It’s from the same person. The content is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does it mean?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這樣的簡訊告訴我怎麼樣用中文表達一件事情，那是我的功課。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她寫這樣的簡訊告訴我怎麼樣用中文表達一件事情，那是我的功課。'

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
She sent you this message to help you with the assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太所述，我有在進修，我需要修滿30個學生，所以我需要做點功課和練習也是很正常的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the specific mention of a Master's program and the requirement to complete 30 credits before receiving a degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order, which affects the clarity and accuracy of the sentence.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you explain on you master degree? What’s it about?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the master's degree.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是關於TESOL 英文教學，它除了包含教學課程以外還有包含一些文化還有本身語言能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of 'courses' in the translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user left out the mention of 'English teaching' in the translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not include the mention of 'culture and language competence' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'TESOL 英文教學' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '我的課程是關於'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user did not place the phrase '它除了包含教學課程以外還有包含一些文化還有本身語言能力' in the correct position in the sentence.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include any punctuation marks in the translation.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So the master degree is about English teaching but it includes some… cultural communication, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得至少有三堂課是有關於文化和溝通。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'courses' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'three'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '堂' which means 'class' instead of 'courses'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
For these courses of cultural communication, they gave you what kind of assignments?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通課程給的功課，會因為不同的人而不一樣。就我來說，我在台灣，我想要一個教英文的教職，那我就必須要證明我的中文能力很好。所以我有很多功課是關於中英的翻譯。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb phrase '證明我的中文能力很好' (prove my Chinese proficiency) before the subject '我' (I), resulting in incorrect word order.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb phrase '一個教英文的教職' (a teaching position as an English teacher) before the subject '我' (I), resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '教職' (teaching position) as '教英文的教職' (a teaching position as an English teacher), which changes the meaning of the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '中英的翻譯' (Chinese-English translation) as '中英的翻譯' (Chinese-English sentence translation), which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove your Chinese competence. That’s why the course give you the Chinese translation assignments?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of completing assignments as part of the course.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'give' before the subject 'the course', resulting in incorrect word order.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對，當然我也有被…也有被訓練一些寫作和口說方面的能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, the messages are your assignments?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，那就是我的作業，你知道中文句子很多時候對外國人很難，我就請我的同事把句子翻譯成英文，然後再用簡訊傳給我。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '然後再用簡訊傳給我' which means 'and then sent it to me via text message', which was not present in the original text.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you asked your colleague about the Chinese sentence and she translated it into English and sent it to you. This is the situation at that time? That is only the sentence of the assignment?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical context of the original text, which mentioned asking a colleague for a translation and receiving it via text message.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the first sentence, where the subject and verb are reversed.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那句話只是我作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Exhibition 1, page 14 to 16. Please check the messages. Are these messages only for the assignments? They are only the answers to the assignments?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，這些簡訊都是我的功課而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So about your wife mentioning you have an affair with your coworker, what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我覺得我的太太真的想太多了，我知道她一直嫌我不夠專注在家庭。我想要庭上知道，她打從一開始就沒有支持我，關於我對碩士學位的進修。如果她當初有在我進修的時候幫忙我，那我也不需要問我的同事，我覺得她要對她的誤解負責。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, I think there are some unpleasant moments between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們一開始結婚的時候是很快樂，但問題是我的工作，我教葡萄牙文，授課時數不穩定。所以工作成了我們爭吵的重點，我們常為這個在吵，她不相信我已經很盡力了，我也無法讓她知道我多沮喪。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s come back to the Master program. When did this program start? Do you get the degree?

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我從2015年秋天開始修這個碩士學位，我預計在2017年五月修完，但是我沒有拿到這個學位，因為我有一些兼職，我沒有時間去做作業。就像我剛剛說的，我的太太從來沒有幫忙過我，我一直都是一個人在做這件事情，我真的很累也很沮喪。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You said that this master program is a two-year course but you did not finish, why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成課程的所有作業還有一些課程要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out 'all' in 'all the course assignments'
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out 'also' in 'also the course requirement'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我沒辦法完成課程的所有作業'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '還有一些課程要求'

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When is your last semester of registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後日期是2017年的春天。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'semester' from the translation.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
According to your last registration date, that is May 2017. After that, you wouldn’t have any assignment but the massagers with your coworker last 7 months after that. Why?

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成課程不代表我不想學好中文，我還是想要精進我的語言能力，所以我就自學了
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that even though you did not finish the Master program, you still want to learn Chinese ad sharpen your Chinese ability, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
對，這就是為甚麼我請我的同事幫忙?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' at the beginning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'that' after 'why'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'I' before 'asked'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'my' before 'colleague'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'for' before 'help'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question mark at the end of the sentence.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the role of your colleague, she is like your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'tutor' does not accurately convey the meaning of '家教' which refers to a private tutor who provides academic assistance.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是家教，她是一個很好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject 'you' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我原本想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'offered' in the translation.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you did not pay her, why she still send you the message during bed time? Is it beyond coworkers’ relationship?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why did she still send you the message during bed time if you did not pay her?'

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
我說過她是一個很支持的朋友，她用她自己的時間來幫我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '她用她自己的時間來幫助我'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'English' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我還在那工作。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does the colleague still work there too?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她還在那工作，但我們不再是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們不再是搭檔了' instead of '但我們不再是了搭檔'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, is there any witness you want to subpoena or any evidence you want to investigate?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'want' before the subject 'prosecutor', which is incorrect in English.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena the coworker in cram school, that is Rong-Er Wang in May Er May cram school. She can come to court as witness and explain the details of this case.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the relationship between the witness and the defendant, as well as the background and purpose of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
About the coworker in cram school… I heard that people in cram people had taken some action on this matter. They tried to convince the coworker to quit. I would like to verify this matter.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the relationship between the two people in the cram school.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'in cram people' instead of 'in cram school', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '補習班' as 'cram people' instead of 'cram school'.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? Your course had ended in May 2017. You cannot say that your messages are just for assignments. Furthermore, your interaction of messages is over 9:00pm. It cannot really be explained. So do you have any evidence you want to investigate?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有任何想要法庭代為調查的證據，我和同事的關係真的很簡單，我只是想要精進我的中文能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next proceeding is at 4:30pm June 24th, 2018. We will have the procedure of questioning witness. The defendant and the accuser both need to show up. Both parties can hire a lawyer if necessary. Do you understand?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of the court proceeding being a witness questioning procedure.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the mention of the court being involved in the proceeding.

 我明白。

Same as the indictment.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparation procedure of an adultery case. The accuser is yu-han Wang. Sha prosecuted her husband, Edward Takayashi, for getting too close with his coworker, 蓉兒-Huang, in the school where Takayashi works. Yu-han Wang found many pieces of intimate message in the defendant’s cellphone. The defendant often works overtime by making up reasons, and he usually make tele-conferencing with his coworker, 蓉兒-Huang. And the accuser thinks that’s beyond coworkers’ relationship. The defendant, your wife doubts that you have an affair. What’s your plea?

grammar and structure	preposition errors	The user used 'in the school' instead of 'at the school' to indicate the location of the coworker's employment.

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯，當然。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In the preparation procedure today, we will ask the defendant about those messages and see if these messages constitute an adultery. Do everybody understand the procedure?

我明白

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Accuser, how long have you married with your husband? And do you have a child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after 'Accuser'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'Accuser' should be translated as '告訴人' instead of '妳'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'how long have you married with your husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years and we don’t have children.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Did you get married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. At that time, my husband came to Taiwan and wanted to teach Portuguese here
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the duration of their relationship.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase 'at that time' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'here' instead of 'in Taiwan', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past few years, is his job teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
He was a Portuguese teacher when we get married, and he kept teaching Portuguese after we married. There are not many people in Taiwan that want to learn Portuguese. As a result, he has an unstable teaching hours and often has a period between jobs for about one or two months. Since he wanted to have more fixed income, he decided to start to teach English. Since his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'get married' instead of 'know each other'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misinterpreting the meaning of 'mother tongue'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just said he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean he wanted to earn a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan as the location for earning the degree.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Since he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he needed to get a degree of TESOL. He found a distance learning program established in California, USA. With this program, he can do online learning at home without going to the U.S. after he earned all the credits, he can get the degree and teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then, what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are coworkers in the same cram school. The program in the cram school, they will have a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher at one class. And they are partners in the class.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have an affair?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'know' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
In the beginning, I found my husband often stay in the school, working over time. I ask him why he had to work overtime just working in cram school. And my husband said he partnered with another Chinese teacher, so they need a lot of communications about the class. First, I didn’t doubt him at all. However, later I found that my husband often receives several calls after work. When he received the call, he didn’t speak in front of me. Instead, he went to his study room. So I decided to check his phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find any unusual in the defendant’s cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
First, I checked his record, and found there is always a same number. Then I checked his mail. I found that he nearly every day contact a woman by mail.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific information about the content of the messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'contact' before the object 'a woman', which is incorrect in English.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
That’s not so unusual sending a mail. Or is there anything strange?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they are just ordinary messages, then I won’t care about them. But the woman sends some intimate words or sentences to my husband. He’s a married man! I have provided some contents to the court. I believe it’s in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
We are presenting file 1, page 13. The defendant, please check. Are these contents of messages the ones in your cellphone?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
對，這是我手機裡面的簡訊。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then I will ask some questions according to this. First messages. The time was 21st December, 2017 at 9:50 p.m. the message’s from 0958932123. The content was, “I really miss you, my love.” What does that mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這個嘛，她是我的同事。那時候我休了兩天的假，她非常擔心我，所以傳訊息問我發生什麼事。我同事是在美國受的教育，所以她心胸很開放，她講話一直都是這樣子的，至於”my love”，這是我們在叫自己在乎的人、關心的人的方式。

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean your colleague is educated in the US, so her thought was westernized, so the way she talks are more open, and “my love” doesn’t mean anything. Is that correct?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its cultural connotations.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user fails to understand the cultural significance of the phrase '我的愛' and its implications in the context.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
沒錯。這就只是很好的朋友，互相關心的朋友之間會講的話而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation does not capture this meaning.

那她前面那句呢？
What does the first sentence mean? “I really miss you.”

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，我們是同事，我們是工作搭檔。我請了兩天假，她當然會非常擔心我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was away for two days.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我請了兩天假' (I took two days off) before the subject '她' (she), resulting in incorrect word order.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean just because you take two days off, she sent this kind of message to you to tell you without your assistance in the class, she really miss you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using 'miss' instead of 'want'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
沒錯，事情的背景就是這樣子。沒什麼大不了的。

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message. The time was 11:55 p.m., on 29th December, 2017, from the same number. The content was, “I want you by my side, when can we truly get together?” Why do you have this kind of message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'be truly together' as 'truly get together' changes the meaning slightly.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她是在教我要怎麼，她是在教我作業，她在教我這句話該怎麼用中文表達。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of the message being written.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of the assignment.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of the purpose of the message.
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	The translation includes unnecessary repetition of '她是在教我'.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The translation adds the phrase '這句話該怎麼用中文表達', which is not present in the original text.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
She sends this message to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我妻子剛剛提到的，我正在攻讀碩士學位，我必須要修滿30個學分才能拿到學位，所以，我自然需要做一些作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'exercises' in their translation.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you explain what on earth are you learning in your Master degree program?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'on earth' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我在修TESOL學位，這個學位主要是關於英語教學，也包括一些文化及語言能力的課程。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
You mean you are studying for an TESOL Master’s degree, and the program also includes cultural communication?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'TESOL' in their translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context of 'studying for' in their translation.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
沒錯，我記得至少有三堂課就跟文化溝通有關。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of courses in their translation.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What kind of assignments do these culture and communication program give?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通課程的作業，會針對每一個學生而有不同，像是我的話，我想要在台灣找到一個教英文的工作，所以為了達到這個目標，並加強我的語言能力，我必須顯示我有很好的中文能力。所以我的作業有很多需要翻譯中文句子。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean since you want to teach English in Taiwan so you need to show that you have good Chinese competence. And so you will have the assignments like translation, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the assignments given in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，除此之外我還需要增強我的口說跟寫作的能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '需要' (need) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s come back to this question. Is this your assignment? The message in your phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我記得我的這個作業，我需要將這個句子翻成英文，但是你也知道，有些中文字對我們來說，是很難詮釋、很難了解的，所以我請我的同事翻譯這個句子，並將答案寄給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by their colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not in correct English word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'recognize' instead of 'understand' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user did not include any greetings or polite language in their translation.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You ask your colleague how to translate this sentence to English, so your colleague type this sentence in English and send to you. This message is just the answer of your assignment, correct?

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就只是我作業的解答而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Page 14 to 16 in file 1. That’s all message contents in your cellphone. Are they all your answers of your assignment?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，這些簡訊全部都是為了完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'messages' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '全部' (all) before '簡訊' (messages), which is incorrect in Chinese word order.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Your wife accuse that you have an affair with your colleague. What’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我妻子真的想太多了，我知道她一直對我沒辦法穩定地養家這件事情很不滿意，她從我一開始修習這段課程開始，就沒有對我任何的支持。她完全不想協助我得到這個學位，如果她能多支持我一點，我就不用為了完成作業，向我的同事求助，所以她該為這整件事情負責。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, it seems that you two are not getting along with each other, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚的時候，我們相處得很不錯，但是我的工作一直是個問題，我想要在這裡教葡萄牙語維生，但是我的授課時數一直都不穩定，我的工作問題一直成為我們吵架的話題，我的妻子不相信我已經盡力了，而我也沒有辦法讓她了解我所面對的挫折以及困境。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Alright. Let’s go back to your Master degree. When di
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation is missing the question about when the Master degree program started and ended, and whether the user has obtained the degree.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2015年秋天開始課程，這是一個兩年的課程，所以我原本應該在2017年的5月就可以修習完畢，可是我在這期間也一直有在做兼職的工作，沒有時間完成我的作業，所以我還沒有得到學位。像我剛剛說的，我的妻子完全沒有給我任何支持，讓我覺得我是很孤獨地在攻讀這個學位，我非常的疲憊和挫折。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You said this is a two-year program, and you didn’t finish it. Why is that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成所有的課程作業。我也沒有達到一些課程的要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not being able to finish the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When is your registration of the last semester?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後一個學期是到2017年的春天為止。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'registration' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '到2017年的春天為止' (until spring 2017) before the phrase '我註冊的最後一個學期' (the last semester of my registration), resulting in a word order error.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
Like you said, your last semester was until May, 2017. Your messages should have been over after you finished that semester. However, your messages…you two kept sending messages to each other after 7 months…what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
即使我的課程已經結束，可是我還想要繼續增進我的語言能力，所以課程結束之後，我還是想要自學。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean even if you didn’t get a Master’s degree, you still want to keep learning Chinese and want to speak fluent Chinese, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
對，所以我才繼續找我的同事求助。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'continue' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So this colleague is playing a role of your tutor, correct?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，也是一位真心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject 'you' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我想付費給她的，但是她拒絕了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'offered' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我想付費給她的' (I want to pay her) before the negation '沒有' (no), which changes the meaning of the sentence.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay for her, why she sends message to you at the time when she should go to bed. It’s not the thing just a coworker would do.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the original meaning

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個非常支持我的朋友，她願意犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我才說她是一個非常支持我的朋友'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the detail that the friend was helping the user learn Chinese. The correct translation should include '她願意犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學中文'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in this cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'teach' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'still' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'work'.

Yes, I am still working there.
是，我還在那裡工作。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is this colleague still work there, too?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Is this colleague still working there, too?'

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她也還在那裡工作，可是我們不是工作搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '可是我們不是工作搭檔了' instead of '可是我們不是工作搭檔了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any evidence that want to investigate further or other witness you want to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena this colleague, 黃蓉兒, in 美而美cram school as a witness and ask her about the relationship between she and the defendant and the context and purpose of those messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Accuser, do you have any evidence that need the court to investigate further?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the court in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'Accuser' and 'do you have any evidence'.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that 美而美cram school has taken some actions based on their relationship and even pursue 蓉兒-Huang to quit her job. I want to verify if this is true.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word '黃' before '蓉兒-Huang'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'pursue' before the object '蓉兒-Huang', which is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'pursue 蓉兒-Huang'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '美而美' as '美cram school', which is not an accurate translation. '美而美' should be translated as 'Mei Er Mei' or 'Mei and Mei'.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
Defendant, do you have any evidence that you need the court to investigate for you? According to the situation now, you have already finished your program in May, 2017. You have no reason to send messages with your colleague by the excuse of doing assignment. Furthermore, you send messages to each other after 9 p.m. You need more evidence to help you with this case.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master's degree and the suspicion raised by the timing of the messages.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context of the defendant's interaction with Huang Rong'er and the suspicion it raises.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence about the defendant's master's degree and the lack of reason for the messages.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到其他能請法庭代表我調查的證據，我和我同事之間的對話真的很單純，我只是想要增進我的語言能力，想要把中文學得更好。

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next proceeding is set to be at 4:30 p.m. on 24th June, 2018. Both parties should appear in the court. You both can have a lawyer with you. Do both parties understand?

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure preparation procedure, we will umm examine the details of the Edward’s the defendant’s messages, and try to see whether this constitutes the crime of adultery. Does Do both parties understand… today’s procedure? Have any problem?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我明白
I understand.

I understand.
我明白

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, the accuser, how long have has your marriage been? Do both of you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject and verb agreement is incorrect in the question.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married four years, and we don’t have any children.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Then, are both of you married in Taiwan? Or in other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
Both of us were met in Taiwan. Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan umm to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past four years, is his job is to teaching to teach Portuguese? Or, does he have other jobs?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the question

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
Umm, at first when we got married, he was still a Portuguese teacher. Umm After we married, he was still teaching Portuguese. Umm However, Portuguese isn’t a very hot uh very… many people want to learn Portuguese…there are not many people want to learn Portuguese, so his teaching hours is not stable, and sometimes he has a period between jobs. Umm After that, he wants to make his income more stable, so he wanted to teach English instead of Portuguese. However, English is not his mother tongue, so he has to he has to seek an advanced degree umm on English.

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'uh' instead of 'um'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting 'hot' as 'many people want to learn'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating 'mother tongue'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree umm. Does this mean that umm he wants to umm another degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	rearranging the sentence structure

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, I he he wants a degree on English because he wants to teach English and his degree is should… should be about English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California, USA, so he don’t have to go to the school. He can uhh use this terms of learning to learn English. After he finished all the credits, he can get a umm master degree in USA, so he might can find a teaching job in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'I he he wants a degree on English'

omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	inserting the word 'umm' in the sentence 'After he finished all the credits, he can get a umm master degree in USA'

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then, what’s the relationship between the husband and the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
Umm The woman is his co-worker in the cram school. The cram school will arrange a Chinese teacher and an English teacher uh for English teaching, and umm the woman is partner with my husband.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'know' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
In the cell phone, did you find any umm weird part?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
Umm, I found umm I found umm the same number which frequently appeared in his phone book umm which is really weird, so I just find who the girl is, and I found is Ms. 黃.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker checked the text messages.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context that the speaker was curious and checked the text messages.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the unnecessary detail of the girl's name.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user inserted the information about the girl's name, which was not mentioned in the original text.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even it’s just messages, it sounds okay. Umm Is there anything weird? Is there any intimate message in there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it’s just a normal messages, I would think it’s fine. But my husband is a married man, how could he sent…how could that woman send so intimate messages to him?Umm, I already I already offered some evidence. It should already be in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '已婚的人' as 'married man' instead of 'husband'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the intimate messages.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context of providing evidence to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Umm Just as We will show some evidence about this case. We will display some pic..pictures in the investigatory file page three. Umm is this message in youy cell phone? Is this the message which you sent to the woman?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing period at the end of the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'pic' should be 'pictures'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The phrase 'investigatory file' should be translated as 'investigation file'.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的, 這些是在我的手機上的簡訊
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '是的' (yes) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb '這些是' (these are).

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then, so, then I will I will umm ask some questions according to your messages. Umm on the date of December twenty-one, 2017, at the time twenty-one fifty p.m., there was a messages sent by the number 0958932123. The content was umm I really miss you my baby. Is this sent by the woman?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	baby instead of love
grammar and structure	word order errors	repetition of 'umm' and incorrect word order in the sentence

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
恩, 這個是我的同事傳給我的, 我記得那個時候我請了兩天假, 她很擔心我的質狀況所以傳這封簡訊給我, 恩, 我的同事是在美國受教育的, 所以她的思想是開放的, 恩, 這種訊息只是我們關心對方的一種方式, 所以並沒有什麼不妥之處
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	omission of details	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs
omission or addition	omission of details	inserting content not present in the original text
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So you’re meaning that umm your co-worker studied in foreign country, in US., so she is westernized and open-minded, so “my love” sisn’t mean anything special or intimate. Is that right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the meaning of '我的愛' as not having any special or intimate meaning, which is incorrect.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
恩, 沒有, 這沒有什麼特別的意思, 這只是單純朋友之間的訊息, 或者是你傳給你在意的人的一種很普通的訊息罷了
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user states that the expression has no special meaning and is just a simple message between friends, which is not consistent with the original text's explanation that it is a common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.

那她前面那句呢？
Then what… what about the previous sentence?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛的一樣, 我們是很好的同事, 痾, 我請了兩天假, 她只是很擔心我, 所以才傳了這封訊息給我
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was away for two days.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '痾, 我請了兩天假' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '很好的同事' to translate 'partners at work', which does not accurately convey the meaning.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So, you are meaning that her message is just to express that she reallycared about you, and without your assistant in the cram school, she was hard in the job. Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text suggests that the sender of the message expressed missing the user's assistance in class, while the user's translation implies that the sender cared about the user personally.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的, 這就是那封簡訊的內容, 恩這個根本就沒有甚麼大不了的
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the message being a text message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
So, next I will we will talk about the next the second message. It was at the time 11:55 p.m. on the date 2017 December 29th from the same person. Umm, the context is “I want you to by my side, when can we truly be together.”
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	to by my side
grammar and structure	word order errors	to by my side

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳…當時她傳這封簡訊只是想要表達恩這句英文..這個中文要怎麼寫, 在我的功課範圍之上
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'express' is translated as '表達恩' which is not the correct translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation does not include the context of the message being about a Chinese sentence in the assignment.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So, you are saying that the the woman sent you this message just to help you with your assignment? What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misinterpreted the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我老婆剛剛所告告知法官的, 我當時正在修一個碩士課程, 需要修完30學分, 這個是我必須做的功課之一,
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about completing assignments and exercises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '這個是我必須做的功課之一' in the wrong position in the sentence.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you please explain what did you learn…what did you learn in your master degree?

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
恩我的碩士學位是有關於英語教學的, 只要是關於怎麼教英文, 其他部分還有關於文化還有一些語言能力的部分
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the specific courses mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation does not mention that some courses were related to culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So, you are meaning that your master degree is related to TESOL, and in this program also have some courses related to language competence. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of cultural communication courses in their translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context of the courses being related to cultural communication.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的, 我至德..記得至少有3門課是和文化還有溝通有關係的
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'courses' at the end of the sentence instead of the beginning.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '至德' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'remember'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So, what’s your assignment in this kind of culture and communication courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這個文化與溝通課程會依每個學生的狀況不同而有所變化,就以我自己為例子, 我想要在台灣尋求教英文的一職, 恩 為了達成我的目標, 並且顯是我的語言能力, 恩所以才會有這樣子的功課, 所以很多我的功課內容都是關於中英翻譯
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	not adapting greetings and etiquette

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, you’re telling me that you want to find a teaching position in Taiwan; umm to reach this goal, the culture courses includes some Chinese translation, and also this translations is part of your assignment. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the master's degree program and the requirement to prove Chinese language proficiency.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'umm to reach this goal' in an incorrect position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'culture courses' instead of 'master's degree program' in the translation.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的, 恩 我還需要增進自己的會話和寫作的能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
OK, let’s go back to your pre previous sentence. Umm Do you mean that this is your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的, 當我收到個功課的時候, 恩, 你也知道外國人對學中文這件事情是非常難的, 所以我不知道要怎麼翻譯, 我就把這個句子傳給我的同事, 請求她的協助, 希望她能幫我翻譯這句話
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So your meaning is umm because you don’t know the sentence the translation of this sentence, so you sent this message to your co-worker, and asked her to send the Chinese translation back umm. It is just for your assignment only? And didn’t have other special meanings?

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the meaning of the original text
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the cultural context

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是我的作業答案
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the message being an answer to homework.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Ok, then let’s show some evidences. See the file from the p.14 to p.16, the content of the message. So, all of the messages are only related to your assignment and didn’t have other special meaning?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的, 這些所有的訊息都只是為了完成我的作業
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then, according to your wife, about you have love affair with your co-worker, what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'love' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'about' in the wrong position in the sentence.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
恩我覺得我的老婆只是想太多了, 她就是不滿 對於我的工作能力不能滿足, 恩覺得我沒辦法支持這個家庭, 但從一開始, 我學這個碩士課程的時候, 她也沒給我任何的協助, 恩因..因為她不願意幫我, 如果她願意幫我的話, 或是就是幫那麼一點點忙, 我也不用去拜託我的同事, 所以我覺得她就是這件..誤會的罪魁禍首

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
Just as what you mentioned, umm both you and your wife are not getting well with each other?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
恩在我們的婚姻一開始我們確實相處得很好, 而且有很多甜蜜的時光, 但是在這之後, 她對我的就業狀況感到不滿, 我一開始是教葡萄牙文, 但是我的工作時數不穩定, 然後這個就變成我們爭執的原因, 她不相信我曾經為了這件事情努力過而且掙扎過, 然後個就變成我們之間的問題並且會常常為了這事情而爭吵不休

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Well, let’s go talk about your master degree. When did the master degree begin, and how was it going? Did the master degree end or not?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
恩這個碩士學位是在2015年開始的一個兩年學程, 它應該要在2017年結束, 但是因為我自己個人的打工工作, 所以我最後沒有如期地完成, 就像我剛剛所說的, 我的老婆並沒有就是為我幫我完成這個學位, 痾我覺得我從頭到尾都是孤軍藝人在學這個學位, 這讓我覺得非常地挫折和非常地疲倦

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
Then, when is your your.. the last.. the final semester that you registered?

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我的最後一個註冊學期是在2017年的春
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'semester' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the year '2017' before the phrase 'spring' instead of after.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If what you just mentioned are true, then your courses and your program should be ended in May 2017. You shouldn’t have any assignment of this program. Then why did you have this kind of messages...this kind of assignment with your co-worker even after you end your program for 7 months? What’s your explanation?

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'assignment' instead of 'messages'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of 'assignment'

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然我的我的碩士課程已經結束, 但這不表示我不想再精進我的中文, 就算課程結束, 我還是想練習中文翻譯, 所以我才傳訊息給她

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'program' as '碩士課程' (master's program) instead of '課程' (program).
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate 'language ability' in the sentence.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So, you are telling me that even this program already ended, you still want to polish your Chinese ability. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的, 這就是為什麼我請我的同事來幫我
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, in this whole situation, the co-worker that you mentioned is acted like a tutor of yours…tutor.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'acted' is not an accurate translation for '所扮演的角色'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅是一位家教, 她對我而言更是我朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
Then did you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the pronoun 'you' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the past tense 'did' for the verb 'pay', but the original text does not indicate past tense.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有, 我曾經提議要付她錢, 但是她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經提議要付她錢, 但是她拒絕了'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her for money, then why did she send you the messages at midnight? Normal people will sleep at this time. Umm Isn’t this beyond co-worker’s relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這件是為什麼我說她是一個非常幫助我的朋友, 她會犧..使用自己的時間來教我中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她使用自己的時間來教我中文'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'supportive' which is an important detail in the original text.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still teaching in that cram school?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的, 我還在那裏工作

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
So, this co-worker, is she still working in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的, 她仍在那裏教書, 但是我們並不再是拍檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是我們並不再是拍檔了, 她仍在那裏教書'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, so do you still have any evidence or any witness that needs the court to help you subpoena or gather?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
Umm I want the court to help me subpoena the witness, the co-worker, 黃蓉兒, who is working in that cram school,美而美. Umm, I want her to describe the details of the messages and the relationship between her and the defendant.

The defendant, do you want any evidence that the court help you to investigate?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the 'informant' or 'complainant' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'defendant' before the verb 'want', which is incorrect in English.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I have heard that the cram school, 美而美, already took taken some actions on this issues, and tried to persuaded the woman not to do so. Umm can I have more details about this?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about the actions taken by the cram school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you need any evidence that want the court to help you investigate? Umm Now your master degree should ended in May 2017. You have no reasons to send messages with umm that woman. This shouldn’t be an excuse to do so. Moreover, most of your messages were sended at 9 pm, which is very suspicious. Do you need any evidence that want the court to help you investigate?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'umm' instead of 'any'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我並沒有任何證據需要法官痾法庭幫我查, 恩因為就像我所說的, 我跟我的同事的對話都是非常簡單, 我只是想要精進中文, 並持續練習我的中文
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'improving language ability' and 'continuing to learn Chinese'.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparation procedure for an adultery case. The accuser, 王宇涵, sued his husband, Edward Paparazzi for his relationship with his colleague, which is more intimate than usual. When the accuser checked his husband’s, Edward’s phone message, she found that his husband sends some intimate message with his colleague, and his husband often find an excuse for working late, or going out at midnight, and she found that his husband has an intimate relationship with 黃蓉兒, his colleague, so she sued the case that his husband has some relationship beyond co-worker… and he has an affair beyond co-worker’s relationship with his colleague.The defendant, your wife wants to sue you for adultery, what’s your plea?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparation procedure, we will ask the both parties some questions to confirm if the defendant really reach the level of adultery and we will check the message detail today to see if the defendant reach the level of adultery. Do the the both parties understand today’s procedure?

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, the accuser, how long since.. have … since you married to your husband? How many childrens do you have?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'do you have' instead of 'have you'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for four years, and we don’t have any children.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'husband' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'have' instead of 'has' to match the singular subject 'husband'.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Where did you marry? In Taiwan or in other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that they themselves are also from Taiwan.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So…Does your husband teach Portuguese for the past several years? Or is there any other language he taught?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Does your husband teach Portuguese for the past several years?'

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
He has taught Portuguese for the four past years, and after we got married, he still taught Portuguese. Because Portuguese isn’t an popular language in Taiwan, so he doesn’t have many teaching hours, and he doesn’t have a steady income. So maybe sometimes he will have up to one or two months period between jobs. So to have a steady income, he wants to teach English. But English isn’t his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wants to seek an advanced degree, do you mean that he’s looking for a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating '進修' as 'seeking an advanced degree'

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, I mean that because he wants to teach English, he has to have a degree of TESOL. He found a course on the Internet, and the course is from California, America, and the course provide distant learning program which is distance learning, so he doesn’t have to go to the US and he can enjoy the courses. So after he finished his distance learning program, he can gain a master degree, so he planned to get TESOL and to gain a license to teach English in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'enjoy' instead of 'complete'

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what’s the relationship between he and his adultery partner?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
In the courses, there is an English teacher and a Chinese teacher, and they are colleague relationship. That girl is his Chinese teacher in his company. And they are partner relationship.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '補習班的同事' as 'colleague relationship' instead of 'they are colleagues in the cram school'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '中師' as 'Chinese teacher' instead of 'Chinese teacher in the cram school'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '外師' as 'English teacher' instead of 'foreign teacher in the cram school'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '搭檔教學' as 'partner relationship' instead of 'teaching in partnership'.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you that your husband has an affair with his colleague?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the husband and his colleague having an affair.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses 'how' instead of 'that', resulting in a different meaning.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At the beginning, I only found that he often worked late in the cram school, but after that, I started to think that it is only a cram school, why do you have to work this late? But he explained that because he is an English teacher, he has a lot to communicate with the Chinese teacher so he have to stay in the cram school to communicate with his colleague. At first, I didn’t suspect him. But after I found that when he got home, he often got some phone calls, and he doesn’t want to pick up the phone in front of me. Instead, he went to his study room to talk in the phone. I wonder why he did this, so later I checked his phone.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the part about the wife's suspicion and checking her husband's phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything unusual in his cell phone
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
So later I went to check his dial record, and I found that there’s always a same number on his phone, so later I went to check his phone message, and I found that every night he messaged the same woman…every night.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is messaging a woman every day.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'later' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'dial record' instead of 'call log' to refer to the person's phone records.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
It is not that serious if he sent a message to a woman? Or you found some inappropriate message in his cell phone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it is only some ordinary messages, it’s ok for me. But he’s married, how can he let a woman send some intimate message to him? Before, I have sent some message to court, they are in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
The displayed evidence one. Here is some message from the phone. The defendant, please check if it is the content of your message.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機裡的簡訊。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then I’ll ask some questions based on the messages. The first message which is sent on nine fifty pm, twenty first December, 2017, from the phone number 0958932123, to your cell phone. The message said, 我真的很想你，what does that mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這個是我的一個同事傳給我的。那個時候，我請了兩天的假，他非常擔心我，所以他才傳了這封訊息給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，所以他的思想非常開放，他講這些話都很正常，而我很想你，這些都是因為他關心我所以才會說的話，我們都是這樣溝通的。至於My love，我的愛，那只是因為我們很熟，所以我們都這樣稱呼對方。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added unnecessary details and explanations that were not in the original text
minor categories of grammar and structure	word order errors	rearranged the sentence structure and word order
minor categories of semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	used incorrect translations for certain terms and phrases

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So you mean that because your colleague is educated in the foreign country, so she is westernized, so the message “my love” is because she is open-minded and it doesn’t mean anything, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly interprets the phrase '我的愛' as having no special meaning, when in fact it does.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
沒有啊，那沒有什麼意思，那就只是很好很好的朋友之間會互相稱呼的一個名字而已，或者是非常關心對方的朋友也會這樣講。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, while the user's translation suggests that it has no meaning or is simply a name that friends use to address each other.

那她前面那句呢？
Then what’s the previous sentence in this message?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我講的一樣，我們兩個是非常好的朋友，而之前我請兩天假的時候，他非常的擔心我，所以他才傳了那些訊息給我。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	朋友 (friends) instead of 合作夥伴 (partners)
grammar and structure	word order errors	Subject-verb order is reversed in the sentence
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	Adding unnecessary information about sending messages

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So do you mean that because you took two days off, so she didn’t have your help when she is having a class so she missed you a lot, is that your meaning?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對啊，那就是簡訊的內容，我覺得沒有什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the message being a text message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
So the second message is sent on eleven fifty-five pm, on twenty nine December 2017, from the same cell phone to your cell phone, and the context is “I want you to by my side, when can we be together?” 我想要你待在我的身邊，什麼時候我們才能在一起呢? Why does the message have this context? And what’s your explanation? Why do you have this message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
當初他傳這封簡訊只是想要教我一句我不會的中文，然後他只是要教我這句話要怎麼講。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that your colleague sent this message to you is to help you to learn Chinese, what does that mean? What do you mean she helped you to do your homework?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太之前有提到的，我現在正在進行一個碩士課程，所以我必須要完成三十個學分才能拿到這個學位，那當然我要完成這個學位我必須完成一些作業還有練習，這就是為什麼。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you please first explain what do you learn in your master degree?

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是關於英語教學的。然後這個計畫是教你怎麼去教英文還有一些文化上的問題，所以這其中也包含了語言能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you mean that you’re having TESOL classes in your master degree, and it includes some cultural communication, is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
沒錯，我記得至少有三門課都是有關文化，還有語言溝通的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'related to' in the translation, which changes the meaning and leaves out important details.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '還有' (and) in the wrong position in the sentence, resulting in incorrect word order.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So the so-called cultural communication classes, what assignment you have to accomplish in this course?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
我的們文化還有溝通作業是因人而異的，每個學生都不一樣，就像拿我自己來說好了，因為我在台灣想要尋找一個英語教學的職位，所以我必須要證明我自己的語言能力，我必須證明我的中文能力是好的。所以我有很多作業都是中英文翻譯。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '好了' (okay) at the end of the sentence
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我的們文化' (our culture)

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So do you mean that you want to teach English in Taiwan, so currently you’re studying a master degree to cultivate your Chinese competence…ability? So you have to finish some assignments which is related to Chinese-English translation, is that right?

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，所以此外我還必須加強我的會話、口說還有寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok so let us be back to the sentence we just mentioned. So is it a part of your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我還記得這些句子。這些句子我必須要把它翻譯成中文，然後，這些中文我必須把它翻譯成英文，而且你知道有的時候這些中文的句子對於外國人來說是非常難理解的，所以我才尋求我的同事幫忙。拜託他幫我翻譯成英文然後拜託他把答案傳給我。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added unnecessary details and information that were not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure and word order are incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used incorrect word choices in their translation.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you mean that you typed a Chinese sentence to her and she sent back the answer which is an English sentence to you, is it the situation at that time? So you mean that it is only your assignment, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就是我作業的答案而已，就這樣。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the homework assignment.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Ok, let us take a look at the displayed evidence, page 14 to 16, these are all contexts of your messages. So in these pages, are the messages all your assignment which is the assignment you asked your colleague for help?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯啊，這些都是幫助我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So according to your wife, your wife just said that you have an affair with your colleague, so what’s your explanation on that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我覺得我的太太真的是想太多了。我知道他一直不滿意我對家庭沒有什麼幫助，但在一開始在我學習中文的時候，他也一樣就是也沒有給我什麼支持。他後來完全不支持我完成這個學位，而且如果他有給我支持的話，我也不會找我的同事幫忙。所以我覺得他應該要對整件事情負責，他不應該誤會我，而且他也沒有給我支持。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, there’s something unhappy between you and your wife?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們婚姻一開始的時候，我們也是有一些美好的時光的，但是問題就是在我的職業。我原本一開始是教葡萄牙文的，但是這並不能給我一個穩定的收入，我不能獲得足夠的教學時數。後來因為工作不穩定，成為了我們兩個常常吵架的原因，我們常常吵架，而我的太太不相信我有盡我最大的努力去找工作或學習英文，然後我也沒有辦法讓他理解我的挫折還有我面臨的困難。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Well let’s get back to the issue of your master degree. When did you start your master degree? And did you finish it? Did you get the degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question word 'when' in the translation.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我的碩士在2015年的秋季開始的，原本他應該是一個兩年的計畫，預計在2017年的五月結束，但我並沒有完成這個碩士課程，因為我一邊做我的打工，還要一邊上課，我沒有辦法兩邊兼顧。就像我之前說的，我在讀我的碩士學位的時候，我太太並沒有給我支持，我覺得在讀碩士的一路上我都是一個人，所以我開始覺得很累也覺得很挫折。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So you just mentioned that it is a two-year program, but in the end you didn’t finish it. Why didn’t you finish it?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the reason for not finishing the program.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
因為我沒有辦法完成我課程所有作業。還有一些課程的要求我沒辦法達到。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So when is your registration of your last semester? When did your register end of your last semester?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the second sentence is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後一個學期的期限是2017年的春季。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '2017年的春季'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So if what you said is true, then your course finished in May 2017, so it is reasonable to say that you won’t have any assignment if your courses are finished. But you and your colleague still have sent message to each other for seven months after your course is finished.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
嗯…我的課程結束了不代表我就不想要精進我的中文，我還想精進我的中文，然後完成一些我自己的作業，所以我才傳那些訊息給我的同事去精進我的作文。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of sending messages to colleagues to improve their composition.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '然後完成一些我自己的作業' (and then complete some of my own assignments) in the wrong position in the sentence.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So do you mean that you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that what you mean?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the subject and verb in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是為什麼我要找我的同事幫忙。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So you mean that you colleague is playing a role of your home tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'home tutor' instead of 'role model'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是我的家教，他還是我很好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject 'you' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我本來想付她錢的但他拒絕我了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我本來想付她錢的，但她拒絕了我。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, then why did she sent messages at the midnight to you, which is the time you should go to bed, and she didn’t say anything and she’s not afraid of tiredness to send messages to you? Is it the relationship beyond co-workers?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我說他是一個非常支持我的朋友。因為他用他自己的時間來幫助我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
So do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the subject and verb

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還是在那邊工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
So does your colleague still works there too?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'works' should agree with the subject 'colleague', so it should be 'work' instead.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，他也在那邊工作，但我們現在已經不是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們現在已經不是搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經不是搭檔了現在'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, is there any other people you want to subpoena? Or any evidence you want to investigate further?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena his colleague, who is 蓉兒黃, working in the cram school named 美而美, I hope she can come to the court as a witness and I want to ask her about the relationship between her and the defendant. And I want to ask about the background of the messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the name of the colleague, 黃蓉兒, and the name of the cram school, 美而美.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention the purpose of asking the colleague to come to court as a witness.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention the purpose of asking about the background of the messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school named 美而美 has taken some actions towards the relationship between Edward and 黃蓉兒, and it is about the fact that 黃蓉兒’s leaving her position. I want to ask the cram school if it is true.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the user's intention to ask the cram school if it is true.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? So the situation now is that your course is finished at May, 2017, so you really don’t have any reason to finish your homework by sending these messages, and most of the messages are sent after nine pm, this is very suspected, so do you have any evidence to prove your situation?

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing comma
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong translation of 'investigate'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'finish your homework'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我現在想不到法院可以幫我調查的證據，但是就像我講的一樣，我跟我同事之間的關係是非常簡單的，我只是想要精進我的語言能力，然後繼續把中文學好，就這樣子而已。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court is set at four thirty pm, 24 June, 2018, and we will proceed the procedure of questioning the witness. The both parties please come to the court, and you both can have a lawyer, do you understand?

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The accuser Yu-Hang Wang has prosecuted the defendant Edward Takayashi because the defendant has worked in a cram school, and he has many messages in his phone with another co-worker in that cram school. The defendant sometimes overworks and also have some teleconferencing with the other party. The accuser believes that their relationship has been beyond co-worker’s relationship. Therefore, she has prosecuted this case. The defendant, you wife has suspected you for adultery, what is your plea?

omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user fails to mention that the defendant's wife found intimate messages in his phone.

grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user does not include a comma after the phrase 'The defendant sometimes overworks'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translates '補習班' (cram school) as 'cram school' instead of 'tutoring center'.

Not guilty, of course.
當然是無罪答辯。

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, we will ask the defendant the message he has with the co-worker in order to know whether they had an affair. Do both parties understand?

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I have married my husband for 4 years and we do not have any child.

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the present tense 'do not have' instead of the past tense 'did not have' to match the original text.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Where do you and your husband married? Is it in Taiwan or in other country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan four years ago, and he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Over the past years, is his job always teaching Portuguese?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in the translation.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he is still teaching Portuguese. However, there are not many Taiwanese wanted to learn Portuguese, so his teaching hours is always unstable, there might be a period of one to two months between his jobs. After that, he wanted to have a stable income, so he decided to teach English. However, English is not his native language. Therefore, he is seeking an advanced degree for English.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the husband's teaching hours for Portuguese were unstable and there were periods of one to two months without any classes.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the husband decided to pursue an advanced degree in English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that he was seeking an advanced degree. Does that mean that he is trying to earn a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in their translation.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he need a TESOL degree. He has found an online course on the Internet based in California, United States, so he decided to earn his degree from this distance learning course. He believes that in this way, he could finish his credits, and he could earn a US master degree, so he could teach in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is his relationship with the person he had an affair with?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in a cram school, and in their cram school, they will partner an English teacher and a Chinese teacher, and that colleagues is his partner in the cram school.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that your husband has an affair with her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the husband and the specific person he is having an affair with.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'has' instead of 'have' in the question, resulting in subject-verb disagreement.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything particular in his phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'particular' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is always a same number calling to him. Out of curious, I check his text messages, and I realized they have a lot of text messages every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific information about the person who is sending the text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'In his phone book' at the beginning of the sentence instead of the correct subject 'I'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Those are just text messages, so it should be okay, or is there anything inappropriate?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it is just normal text messages, it should be fine. However, he is a married man, and why would he still text some intimate messages? I have provided some of their intimate messages to the court in the file.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating the term '法院' (court)

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Show file 1 page 13. The defendant, here are some text messages. Are these text messages you have on your phone?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些是在我手機上的簡訊。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I would like to ask the details for these text messages. The first message is sent at 9:50 pm, December 21st 2017, and the phone number is 0958932123 sending to your phone. The content is “I really miss you, my love.” What does that mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
他就只是我的同事而已，我記得我當時請假兩天，他很關心、擔心我，所以他才會傳簡訊來。我的同事是在美國受教的，所以他還蠻開放的。所以他才會那樣說，“my love” 就只是我們關心對方的方式。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'colleague' as '同事' is correct, but the meaning of 'my love' as '我們關心對方的方式' is not accurate. It should be translated as '我愛的人' or '親愛的' to convey the intended meaning of endearment.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that because the sender stays in a foreign country before, so it means that she is westernized, and when she said “my love” does not mean anything at all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its cultural connotations.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user fails to understand the cultural significance of the phrase '我的愛' and its implications in the context.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
是的，這段表達的方式只是我們在乎對方的方式。
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural meaning of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the phrase before that?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，他很擔心我。我是他的搭擋，因此他當然很擔心
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我是他的搭擋' (I am his partner).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'worried' as '擔心' is correct, but the translation of 'missed' as '擔心' is incorrect. The correct translation should be '想念' (missed).

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that because you did not go the work for two days, and you could not assist her, so she texted I really miss you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，這就是簡訊內容上面的意思，並沒有什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in the translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent on the same phone at 11:55 pm, December 29th 2017. The text message is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this text message mean?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他之所以傳給我這封簡訊，是告訴我如何用中文表達這句話的意思
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You said that the other party send this message to help you with the assignment. What does that mean
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
我老婆剛剛有提到我正在爭取我的碩士學位，我必須要拿到30學分才能取得學位，所以當然會有一些作業需要完成。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of attending a Master's program and the requirement to complete assignments and exercises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you please first explain about your Master’s Degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the Master's Degree.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位主要是有關於英語教學。裡面的課程來講的話，主要就是如何教學英文，以及文化和語言能力相關的課程。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the specific mention of courses related to English teaching and culture and language competence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation uses the word '教學' to represent 'teaching', which is not an accurate translation.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you mean that you are now pursuing TESOL degree, and there are some cross-cultural communication courses?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是，我記得有至少三堂課是和文化溝通有關的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'courses' at the end of the sentence instead of the beginning.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '堂' which means 'class' instead of 'courses'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What are the assignments for the cultural communication courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'these' before 'cultural communication courses'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'are' before the subject 'assignments', which is incorrect.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通的課程，作業因人而異。以我自己為例，我現在在台灣教英文，我必須要有好的中文溝通能力。因此，我的作業當中有很多是和中英文翻譯相關。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '以我自己為例' (taking myself as an example) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a period at the end of the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '溝通' (communication) as 'communication' instead of 'communication courses'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '文化' (culture) in the phrase '文化溝通' (culture and communication).

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that because you have planned to teach English in Taiwan , so you have to prove that you have a good command of Chinese, and you have to practice English-Chinese translation. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect interpretation

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的。我也被要求加強我的口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s go back to the text message. Is this one of your assignment
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我還記得那條訊息。你也知道中文對於外國人並不是很簡單，我當時看到中文句子不知道要怎麼翻。因此我才請她幫助我，然後他翻給我這段訊息。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by the colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not in the correct word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'translate' instead of 'interpret'.
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user did not include any greetings or polite expressions in their translation.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You have sent her the English message, and she has help you translated. Is that what you mean?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那條訊息僅僅只是為了我的答案而用而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'answer' in the translation, which is a critical detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Let’s show file 1 page 14 to 16. These are the content of your text messages. Are these messages your assignment that you have to translated, so you seek for help?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些訊息都是相同的目的，為了完成我的作業而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What is your explanation on your wife suspecting you having an affair with your colleague?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我太太想太多了，我知道我自己沒有賺很多錢去支撐這個家庭，但在我念碩士學位上，他並沒有給予太多的支持和幫助。我覺得他不願意幫我完成這份學位，如果他能夠多付出一點心力的話，我覺得我就不會去問我同事了，因此他的錯比較大。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the wife's dissatisfaction with the husband's ability to support the family.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation leaves out the context of the husband asking his colleague for help.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user's translation adds the statement that the wife was not willing to help the husband complete his degree.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, you do not get along with your wife, do you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
一開始，我們的確過得很幸福，但是就業一直是個問題。我當時想要教學葡萄牙文，但是我的授課時數一直不穩定。在就業這個議題上一直是個問題，我們在這件事上爭論。他一直認為我並沒有盡力去找到一份好的工作，我也無法向他表達我垂頭喪氣的一面。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Now let’s get back to the Master’s degree courses. When did your courses start and end? Have you earned your degree yet?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年的秋天開始上課，這是一個兩年的課程，所以預計會在2017年5月完成。但是因為我有兼職工作，並沒有足夠的時間完成作業，因此還沒有取得學位。就像我說的，我太太並沒有想要幫我的意思，我要自己完成這份學位，我感到疲倦、挫折。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mentioned that the course is a two-year program, but you did not finish it. Why is that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我無法完成所有的作業以及課程上所設立的標準。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When is the last semester you have registered?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後一個學期註冊是在2017年的春天。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added unnecessary information

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If everything you stated was correct, your semester should end on May 2017, and you will not have any assignment anymore. Why do you still text your colleague 7 months after the semester?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然我沒有完成學位，但並不代表我不想精進我的語文能力。因此我仍繼續和我的同事來往，希望能夠精進我的中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of studying on their own.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '和我的同事來往' (interacting with my colleagues) in the wrong position in the sentence.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You did not finish your degree, but you still want to practice your Chinese to become more fluently. Is that what you mean?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，所以我才會請我同事幫忙。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
Is your colleague playing the role of a tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不僅是我的家教，也是我的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her for tutoring?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of tutoring in their translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
並沒有，我原本想要付錢，但他卻拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我原本想要付錢，但她卻拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you did not pay for her, why did she try to text you in the middle of the night after sleeping hours? The situation is beyond co-workers.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說他是一個很支持我的朋友，他用他自己的時間幫助我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他是一個很支持我的朋友'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of learning Chinese, which is a critical detail in the original text.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still working in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'teaching' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order of the sentence.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還是在那裡工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does this colleague still work in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'cram school' in the translation.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是，他仍在那家補習班，但我們不再繼續搭擋合作了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們不再搭擋合作了' instead of '但我們不再繼續搭擋合作了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Did the prosecutor have any witness to subpoena or any evidence to investigate on?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation, resulting in an incorrect sentence structure.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena the colleague 黃蓉兒from 美而美cram school as a witness in order to explain her relationship with the defendant and the text messages she sent.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Is there anything the accuser would like the court to investigate?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'accuser' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has taken action to their relationship. The cram school has asked 黃蓉兒 to quit her job. I would like to ask whether the court could verify this matter.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the cram school towards their relationship.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the necessary context for the action taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of trying to persuade 黃蓉兒 to quit her job.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the necessary context for the request for verification from the court.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
Did the defendant have anything you want the court to investigate on? The current situation is that your registration for the Master’s Degree has already finished on May 2017, so you should not use finishing assignment for explanation for the text message with黃蓉兒, especially with those messages were texted after 9 pm, so is there anything you want us to investigate on?
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted critical details about the defendant's evidence

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我並沒有任何證據能夠證明這件事，但我們的關係真的非常單純，就是我想要學語言，增進我的中文能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next proceeding of this case will be on 4:30 pm June 24th 2017. We will move on to the cross-examination of the witness. Both the accuser and defendants could hire lawyers if necessary. Do both parties understand?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific procedure, which is the cross-examination of the witness.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the requirement for both parties to attend the proceeding.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the option for both parties to hire lawyers if necessary.

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.
我也明白。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The accuser is Yu-Han Wang. She prosecuted his husband, 愛德華•塔喀牙什, for an adultery with his co-worker in the cram school because Yu-Han Wang thinks they are too intimate. She found there are a lot of intimate messages in his husband’s cellphone, and Edward Takayashi usually makes up reasons for overworks and get along with his co-worker.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, we are going to ask the defendant about the details of messages. And we will decide whether it constitutes adultery or not. And do you understand?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the critical details of asking the defendant about the details of messages.

我明白
Yes, I do.

I understand.
我了解。

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long have you get married with your husband? Do you have a child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The question does not include the part about having children.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have got married for four years, and we don’t have child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'We have been married for four years.'
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after 'married for four years' to separate the two independent clauses.
grammar and structure	agreement errors in number	The noun 'child' should be pluralized to 'children' to match the subject 'we'.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
So, do you get married in Taiwan or overseas?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan four years ago. He came Taiwan, and he wanted to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'He came to Taiwan' instead of 'He came Taiwan'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'wanted' should be used instead of 'wanted to'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, for the past years, is his job always teaching Portuguese?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in the translation.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met each other at that time, he was a Portuguese teacher. And after we get married, he was still a Portuguese teacher. In Taiwan, there is a few people learning Portuguese. So, his teaching hour was unstable. And there can even be one to two months a period of time between jobs. He wanted a stable job, so he wanted to teach English. However, his mother tongue wasn’t English. So, his sought an advanced degree for that.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'sought' instead of 'decided'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misinterpreting the meaning of 'mother tongue'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
So, you just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree, is that he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of studying in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get a degree about English teaching. He found a distance learning program on California in United States. It is an on-line learning, and he can get his degree at home. After he completes all the courses, he can get a master degree. Through this, he can find a job about English teaching.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	incorrect translation

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So, how’s the relationship of he and the person he has affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school. And in that cram school, they tend to partner with a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher. And the person he has affair with is his partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the relationship between the two individuals.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
So, how do you know they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'how' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'know'.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So, is there anything wrong in his cellphone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'see' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
After I check his record of phone, I found there was a person usually in his phone book. So, I check his messages afterwards, and I also found there was a woman often messaging him.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the phone number and the frequency of the messages.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the critical context of their suspicion or curiosity about the person in the phone book and the messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even the messages, that won’t a big problem, right? Or the content was inappropriate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it a common message, it isn’t a big deal. But my husband was a married man, and how can a woman message him some intimate messages? And I offered some messages for the court in advance, the judge can check that.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '已婚的人' as 'married man' instead of 'husband'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court, which is important context for understanding the situation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Show the evidence, page 13. The defendant, are these messages on your cellphone, right?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些是我手機裡面的訊息。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I am going to ask you about these messages. The first message was on 12/21 in 2017, the time was 9:50 P.M. And the cellphone number was 0958-932123. And the content was that I really miss you, my love, could you explain what’s that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那是我同事傳給我的，然後我記得那天我已經兩天沒去上班了，所以他才傳給我，關心我一下。我同事是在美國受教育的，所以她非常的開放，然後她之所以會叫我親愛的，那是她表現在乎的人的稱呼方式。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect word choice
cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So, do you mean that the person messages you was educated in United States, so her thought was open-minded and westernized. So, she calls you “my love,” it doesn’t mean anything, right?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
嗯對啊，那是我們對於親密的朋友會有的稱呼，並沒有什麼特別的意思。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, while the user's translation suggests that it is simply a term of endearment without any special meaning.

那她前面那句呢？
So, how about the previous sentences?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，我們是同事，然後她非常的關心我，我兩天都沒有去上班，所以她傳個簡訊關心我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the part about the woman missing the speaker when they were away for two days.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我兩天都沒有去上班' (I didn't go to work for two days) in the wrong position in the sentence.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that you didn’t work for two days, so she didn’t have your assistance, so she really miss you, right?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對，就像是簡訊上傳的一樣，這根本就沒有什麼大不了的啊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the message being sent via text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'no big deal' as '根本就沒有什麼大不了的啊', which does not convey the same casual tone as the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent on 12/29 in 2017. The time was 11:55 P.M. And it was sent by the same person, the content was that I want you by my side, when can we be truly together. So, could you explain for that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這封簡訊是為了如何幫我用中文敘述我的中文作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她傳這封簡訊給我，告訴我如何在我的作業中表達一個中文句子。'

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So, you mention that the other party sent the message for you for assisting you to do the Chinese homework. What’s that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
 我老婆剛剛也有提到了，我因為想要找一個英文教師的工作，所以我參加了一個遠距教學的碩士課程，然後在課程裡，我必須完成30個學分，我才可以拿到學位，所以這個作業是在課程裡面所要求的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about completing assignments and exercises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the information about completing assignments and exercises at the beginning of the sentence instead of after mentioning the Master's program.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '遠距教學' (distance teaching) instead of '遠距教育' (distance education) to refer to the Master's program.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
So, could you explain for what do you have to study for your distance learning program for the master degree?

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程主要是英語教學的課程，然後裡面還會包含一些語言能力，還有文化之間的溝通課程。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of the TESOL program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '還有文化之間的溝通課程' (courses related to culture and language competence) before '語言能力' (language competence), resulting in a word order error.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '文化之間的溝通課程' (courses related to culture and language competence) instead of '文化和語言能力' (culture and language competence), resulting in an incorrect word choice.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So, your master degree is about TESOL, right? However, it also contains some culture communication, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'some' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the word 'culture' in the translation, which is important for understanding the sentence.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得有三門課是有關文化溝通的課。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'at least' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '是的' (yes) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb '記得' (remember).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '課' (course) instead of '課程' (courses), which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So, about the culture communication courses, what’s its homework?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'this kind of' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'So' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the comma.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
文化溝通課程的作業會是因人而異的，以我來舉例好了，因為我想要在台灣找一個英語教學的工作，所以呢，我的作業就必須對我的中文是很要求的。所以呢，我的作業當中有很多是中英文需要翻譯的東西。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating 'culture and communication'

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, do you mean that because you wanted to teach English in Taiwan; however, there is a certain Chinese command for you. So, the assignments for culture communication ask you to translate some Chinese and English sentence, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific assignments for culture communication.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'culture communication' instead of 'Chinese language proficiency'.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的沒錯，而且我還要精進我的閱讀跟寫作的能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'required' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '還' (also) before the verb '要' (required), which is incorrect in this context.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, let’s back to the message. Is this message your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對的，那是我的作業，然後那句句子必須中文翻成英文，你也知道的，外國人學習中文是很辛苦的，因為有些字我們真的認不出來，所以我就請我的同事幫忙，然後請她幫我翻譯成中文再傳送過來。
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	added unnecessary information

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So, do you mean that you ask for the translation of the Chinese sentence, and your colleague translates it in English? So, the message is just an answer for the assignment?

That message was only the answer to my homework.
是的，那個簡訊只是我功課的解答。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '是的' (yes) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Let’s show the evidence 1, page 14 to 16. Are all these messages just the answers for your assignment?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊都是為了要協助我完成作業的解答。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, what’s your opinion about your wife’s thought, you have affair with your co-worker?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我太太對於這件事真的是想太多了，而且我剛開始攻讀這個遠距教學課程的時候，她就沒有給予我任何支持，然後她還覺得我對這個家庭不用心。她完全不支持我攻讀這個課程，所以我有作業難題的時候也只好去找我的同事，她應該要為這整件誤會負責。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	incorporating superfluous words or phrases

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
So, according to your thought, is there anything unhappy between you and your wife?

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們一開始是相處非常愉快的，但是呢，主要就是我工作的問題，因為我想要在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是這個教學時數是非常不固定的，所以我們就有一些爭吵。所以這就變成我們之間最大的問題，她不相信我真的已經盡力去找工作了，所以我們就常常為了這個事情爭吵，然後這讓我非常的挫折，然後我也不知道如何面對她。

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So, let’s go back to your master degree program. When did it begin, and is it over?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2015年開始我的碩士課程的，預計在2017年會拿到學位，但因為我一直有在做兼職，最後學分有點拖延，所以沒有拿到這個學位。就像我所說的，我太太從來不支持我讀這個學位，然後這段期間我遇到學業上的瓶頸的時候也沒人可以支持我，這讓我覺得很累又很挫折。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	omission of details	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	inserting content not present in the original text
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect tense usage
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect terms

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mention that the master degree was a two-year degree, how did you fail to complete?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the reason for not completing the degree.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成所有的學分，還有一些其他課程要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When was your last semester of your registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後註冊的學期是2017年的下學期。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you mention, the last semester registration was in spring in 2017. So, reasonably speaking, there was not any homework after that. However, you have messages with your co-worker after 7 months. Why do you do that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'registration' instead of 'end date'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting historical or social context	misunderstanding the timeline

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
即使我沒有拿到那個學位，這不代表我就不想要精進我的語言能力，所以在那之後，我還是一直嘗試著想要精進我的中文能力，所以我就一直靠著自學的方式來進修。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '在那之後' (after that)

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Do you mean that even though you didn’t complete that master degree, you still want to sharpen your Chinese language skill. So, you try your best to learn Chinese, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of meaning

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，所以我找我的同事幫忙。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
 So, your co-worker is kind of your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'private tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是家教，而且還是我一個非常要好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Do you pay for her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'offered' in the translation.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay for her, why does she still message you in the midnight? Is this totally beyond co-worker’s relationship?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我說她是非常有義氣的朋友，然後她甚至不辭辛勞犧牲自己私人時間來幫我學習中文。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	義氣 (yìqì) is not the appropriate translation for 'supportive'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order of the sentence.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那邊工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is your colleague still in there?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她還有在那邊工作，但我們沒有常常搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們沒有常常搭檔了' instead of '但我們沒有常常了搭檔'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any evidence or witness and wanted to investigate or subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I wanted to subpoena the co-worker of the defendant, Rong-Er Huang, as a witness. I hope she will be on court to explain the messages and the relationship with the defendant.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have any evidence and want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the accuser's hope for the court to investigate the evidence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'and want the court to investigate for you' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'evidence'.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard about that Mei Er Mei Cram School tried to intervene this event, and they even tried to fire Rong-Er Huang. So, I hope the court ask Mei Er Mei Cram School to verify the situation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the relationship between the two people involved.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the necessary context for the actions taken by Mei Er Mei Cram School.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the request for the court to ask Mei Er Mei Cram School to verify the situation, which was not mentioned in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence and want the court to investigate for you? Your problem is that your master degree should be over in May in 2017, and you really didn’t have any reasons for messaging with your co-worker, Rong-Er Huang. And most importantly, you usually message each other after 9 P.M. every night, it’s really hard for us not to suspect you. So, do you have anything to help with your case?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master degree being completed in May 2017.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the critical context of the defendant's messaging with his co-worker, Rong-Er Huang.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence mentioning the defendant's messaging with Rong-Er Huang taking place mostly after 9 P.M.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's messaging with Rong-Er Huang causing suspicion.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question asking if the defendant has any evidence to help his case.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有進一步的證據可以證明這件事，但是就像我所說的，我跟我同事之間的簡訊真的單純只是為了想要精進我的中文能力而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court is set on 6/24 in 2018. The time is 4:30 P.M. We will ask questions for the witness. If the both party have necessary assistance, you can have a lawyer.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the country (Republic of China) and the specific year (107).
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the requirement for both parties to attend the court.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the option for both parties to have a defense lawyer if necessary.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the date before the month in the translation.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a period at the end of the sentence.

 我明白。

Same as the indictment.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of an adultery case. The accuser Yu-Han Wang filed this case because his husband Edward Takayashi had a relationship beyond co-workers with a woman in the cram school he works in. There were intimate messages between the two of them and the defendant had made up reasons for working long nights. He also tele-conferenced with Rong-Er Huang at midnight. The accuser believed they have a relationship beyond co-workers. The defendant, your wife has accused you of adultery. What’s your plea?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the fact that the accuser found intimate messages in her husband's phone records.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context that the defendant's wife suspected him of having an affair.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence about the defendant tele-conferencing with Rong-Er Huang at midnight.

grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after the phrase 'The defendant' in the sentence 'The defendant, your wife has accused you of adultery.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'plea' instead of 'defense' in the sentence 'What’s your plea?'

Not guilty, of course.
當然無罪
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, we will ask both parties the details of the case to confirm whether the defendant and his colleague constituted adultery. Do both parties understand?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

我明白
I understand.

I understand.

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long have you married your husband? Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I was married to him four years ago and we don’t have any kids.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of her husband in the translation.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
When did your marriage take place? Was it in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan four years ago. He came to Taiwan because he wants to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker being the one who wants to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the present tense 'wants' instead of the past tense 'wanted' to match the original text.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past few years, his job was to teach Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still teaches Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan. His teaching hours can be very low sometimes. Like..the period between jobs is like one to two month. In order to have a stable income, he decided to switch to teaching English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'period between jobs' instead of 'empty period of classes'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misinterpreting the meaning of 'empty period of classes'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree, does it mean that he want to have a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advanced degree' instead of 'further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to get a degree on English-teaching. He found a distance learning program online from California so he can have distance learning instead of taking course in the USA. After he finishes all his courses, he can get a master degree. Therefore, he is able to get a job in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'distance learning'

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is his relationship with the person he has an affair with?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They were colleagues at the same working place. The cram school will partner an English teacher with a Chinese teacher. They were partners.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of '補習班' (cram school) and '中師' (Chinese teacher).

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you assume that they have adultery?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything suspicious on his phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'suspicious' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there was a number he often called and answered. So I was curious and I checked his messages and I found out he had been texting this girl for a long time.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the person in question was calling and answering the phone number frequently.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the context that the person in question was checking the messages out of curiosity.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'checked' before the object 'his messages', resulting in incorrect word order.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even if they text each other, it was merely messages. Or is there any inappropriate messages?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks if the content of the messages is inappropriate, while the user's translation asks if there are any inappropriate messages.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
He is a married man. Why did the woman text him intimate messages? I have provided files to the court previously. The evidence should be in the files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '讓對方發一些很親密的字句' as 'the woman text him intimate messages' instead of 'how could he let the other person send intimate words'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing the files to the court in their translation

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Check and confirm the evidence used in the case. Investigatory record p.13, are these the messages you sent, defendant?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機上的簡訊內容。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I am going to ask you some questions based on these messages. The first message was sent on December 12th ,2018 at 9:50 pm. It was sent by the number 0958-932123. The content is「I really miss you, my love」. What does that mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I really miss you, my love' is incorrect.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封簡訊是我同事傳來的，我記得那時候請了兩天假，她有點擔心我，所以才傳的。我同事在美國受教育所以她思想比較開放，至於我的愛呢，那只是我們對在乎的人的稱呼。

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that because your colleague is educated in the US before so she is westernized and has an open mind so my love does not mean anything special?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the meaning of the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿，那只是對在乎的人一個常用的稱呼而已。
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural meaning of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the “I miss you” part?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛說的，那時候我請了兩天的假，她自然就打出了那些字阿。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker being worried about in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '打出了那些字阿' at the end of the sentence instead of after '她自然就'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean the reason she sent the message is because at then you took two days off and without your assistance she missed you a lot.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是阿，內容大致如此，那簡訊沒什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in the translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent on December 29th , 2018 at 11:55pm, and it was sent by the same number, the content was “ I want you by my side, when can we be truly together? ” what does this mean?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這封訊息來教我怎麼正確表達在我作業上的中文句子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '她傳這封訊息來教我怎麼在我作業上正確表達中文句子。'

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
She sent the message because she wanted to help you in the assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太告知法院的，要完成碩士學位，我必須修滿三十學分，所以我自然有一些功課要做。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you please explain what the program of your master degree is?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'program' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'program' at the end of the sentence instead of the beginning.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是有關英語教學的，除了教學以外還有些課程和文化跟語言能力有關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So your master degree was about TESOL and there are some cultural communication programs?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少有三堂有關文化溝溝通的課程
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'related to' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'related to' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'courses'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What is your homework in those courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這樣的課程會給學生們不同的作業，像我在台灣是要找一個英文教學的工作，為了達到這個目標，我需要證明我中文很好。所以我的作業裡面有很多關於中翻英的句子。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '很' before '好'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我中文很好'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	translated '課程' as '課程' instead of 'assignments'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	did not translate 'culture and communication courses'

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So because you plan to teach English in Taiwan, the homework is to somewhat prove your Chinese ability by giving you assignments on translating sentences?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，同時我也被要求要精進我的口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Back to what we mentioned, this is your homework right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我記得那句。當我看到那些中文句子，我不知道怎麼翻譯成英文，中文字對外國人來說有時候很難理解，所以我就向她尋求幫助，然後再叫她回傳答案給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by the colleague.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you mean you told your colleague the Chinese version of the sentence and she sent it back the English version by messages and it is merely the answer to the homework?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical context of the original text, which mentioned asking a colleague for the translation of a sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order should be 'she sent back the English version'.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是我作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
So back to investigatory file one page 14 to 16, please take a look at those messages. Are they all sent by this colleague because she wanted to help you on your assignment?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的這些簡訊都只是用來解答我的作業而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So what is your explanation about your wife accusing you having an affair with your colleague?

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statements, are there any unhappy events between you and your wife?

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
結婚一開始，我們的確相處的不錯，後來她就對我教葡萄牙語這件事非常不快，因為我拿不到穩定的授課時數。我的工作就變成我們之間最主要的問題。我沒辦法讓她明白我的挫折和困難。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So back to your master degree, when did you start the degree and when did it end?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question about whether the person obtained the degree or not.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這個課程在2015年的秋季開課的。這是個兩年的學程。照理來說我在2017年的五月就該畢業了。可是因為我做兼職的工作，所以我沒辦法好好完成我的那些作業。就像我說的，我太太並沒有很支持我。在我看來，我是獨自完成這個學位而沒有靠她的任何幫忙。我覺得很累也很挫折。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
The program was to study for two years, but you did not. Why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成課堂上的所有作業。還有一些課堂上的要求
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out 'and also the course requirement'

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
What is the last semester you registered in?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後一學期是2017的春季班。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the word '班' (class) which is not present in the original text.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said the last semester of your registration was in May 2017, but the messages continued seven months later after you should have finished your degree. And why is that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
儘管我沒有完成我的學位，這也不代表我不想精進我的語言能力，在課程結束後我還是有繼續精進我的中文能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Just like you said, you wanted to keep learning Chinese despite you failed to finish your degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的。這就是我向我同事尋求協助的原因。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '是的' (Yes) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the comma.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'colleague' as '同事' (colleague) instead of '朋友' (friend).

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague’s role is to be your tutor?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'just' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅是我的家教更是我真心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject 'you' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有。我原本要給她錢但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我原本要給她錢但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she still text you at midnight? It is way beyond a colleague’s duty.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我說她是非常支持我的。她用她私人時間來幫我回答問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '她用她的私人時間來幫我回答問題。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'help me learn Chinese' is not accurately conveyed in the translation. It should be '幫我學習中文'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still working at the cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'teaching' in their translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那工作
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
And does this colleague still work there?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她還在那邊工作但我們不在是搭檔關係了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們不再是搭檔關係了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Does the prosecutor wish to subpoena any witness or investigate any ecidence?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope the court to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, Rong-Er Huang, to explain the reasons and the background of those messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'The accuser' at the beginning of the sentence instead of the end.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had took some actions. They have persuaded Rong-Er Huang to leave the job because of her relationship with my husband. I want the cram school to clarify the statement.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'husband' instead of 'they'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting social context	misunderstanding the relationship between the husband and Rong-Er Huang

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate for you? Your lesson should be finished in May 2017. You shouldn’t make up reasons for texting her seven months later. And your messages were all sent in midnights. Do you have any evidence to help you explain the situation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect tense
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有什麼證據好提供的。就像我說的，我和我同事之間的關係很簡單。我就是想要精進我的語言能力然後她幫助我。

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next proceeding will be on June 24th ,2018 at 4:30 pm. The accuser and the defendant, please be here on time. Both parties can hire a lawyer if necessary.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the witness examination procedure.

請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
Prosecutor, please state the crime.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the request for the prosecutor to state the crime.

如起訴書所載。
Same with the indictment.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details mentioned in the original text.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case and the incident is that the defendant has an affair with the cram school teacher and they often message through the phone and has a telephone-conferencing at midnight and the message is too intimate and the defendant often finds reasons to work too late and he often has an telephone-conferencing with黃蓉兒and this is beyond coworkers’  relationship, so we prosecute the defendant.The defendant, your wife accused you for having an affair with other women. What’s your plea?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff's name, Wang Yuhan.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the plaintiff's husband's name is Edward Takayashi.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention that the plaintiff found intimate messages in her husband's phone records.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention that the defendant often uses the excuse of working late to have conversations with his coworker, Huang Rong'er.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention that the plaintiff's collected communication content goes beyond normal coworker relations.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention that the plaintiff is accusing the defendant of adultery.

omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention that the defendant's wife is accusing him of committing the crime of adultery.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention that the defendant's wife is accusing him of committing the crime of adultery.

Not guilty, of course.
我無罪阿。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'Not guilty, of course.', the user's translation says 'I am not guilty.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. Instead of saying 'Not guilty, of course.', the user's translation says 'I am not guilty.'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, we mainly try to understand the detail of the adultery case and do both parties understand today’s procedure?

我明白

I understand.
我明白。

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
I want to ask the accuser first. How long have you been married? How many kids do you have?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I have been married with my husband for four years and we don’t have any kids.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Then, where did you get married? In Taiwan or in foreign countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
My husband and I met in Taiwan and he came to Taiwan in order to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the duration of their acquaintance.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'came' before the subject 'he', resulting in incorrect word order.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past four years, did your husband teach Portuguese all the way?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met with each other, he was an Portuguese teacher and he continued to teach Portuguese.However, the learning people of Portuguese in Taiwan is not too much and teaching hours is not stable and the job always has a period between jobs.Because the income is not stable, so my husband decided to learn mother tongue and seek an advanced degree.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	incorrect translation of 'mother tongue'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that your husband are seeking an advanced degree and does that mean he wants to get a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'husband' in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context of 'husband' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'your husband' and 'are' in the translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'your husband' instead of 'he' in the translation.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because my husband want to teach English in Taiwan, so he want to get a degree about English teaching. He searched for a distant learning program from California in America. He just go for a course of distant learning and meets the qualification that he could get a degree.In this way, he can get a master degree of English learning and after he gets the certificate, then he can teach English in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the information that the husband wants to teach English in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the information that the husband found a distant learning program from California in America.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the information that the husband plans to find a job as an English teacher in Taiwan after obtaining the degree.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
 So, what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
Then, his cram school proposed a case about the combination of Chinese and English teaching and my husband partnered with the Chinese teacher.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the female teacher in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'my husband' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'partnered with the Chinese teacher', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'proposed a case' instead of 'arranged' to describe the cram school's action.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'know' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
 My husband always stayed in the cram school for the reasons of the too much working load but I don’t think that the loading is too heavy. They said that they had to communicate with the partner about the teaching course. At first, I didn’t have any suspection for my husband but I observed that after he came back, he always has a phone call and didn’t talk about the content of the phone call and always got to the study room to have a phone call, so I started to suspect of my husband.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'loading' instead of 'workload'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	not understanding the concept of a 'cram school'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So, in the cell phone, do you find something weird?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I found in his phone book they are too many the same number, so I started to check his message and found that they have a lot of messages with each other.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the curiosity or suspicion that led them to check the messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'in his phone book' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'found'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'phone book' instead of 'communication records' to refer to the source of the repeated phone number.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even though they just message to each other, I think it is not too strange. It’s still OK.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
I think if they don’t have nothing, why did they often send intimate messages to each other and use the intimate words and phrases. He has been married and why did he do that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation omits the critical context mentioned in the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
The defendant, please look at the indictment 1 page 13. There are some messages. Do you send these intimate messages?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些親密訊息都是在我手機上。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'intimate' which is a critical detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'intimate' after the word 'messages' instead of before it.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I’ m going to ask you some questions based on these intimate messages.The first message happened at 106/12/21 9:50 p.m. and the phone number is 0958-932123 and the message content is “I really miss you, my love.”

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那是我其中一個同事發給我的簡訊。因為我前兩天都加班到很晚，所以她關心我的狀況。我同事是受過美式教育的，所以她是非常的劍潭與開放。那至於這個my love，只是我們之間的一個稱謂而已，其實沒有什麼。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '因為我前兩天都加班到很晚，所以她關心我的狀況。' The correct word order should be '因為我前兩天都加班到很晚，所以她關心我的狀況。'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect translation of 'open-minded' as '劍潭' in the sentence: '我同事是受過美式教育的，所以她是非常的劍潭與開放。' The correct translation should be '開明' or '思想開放'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect translation of 'my love' as '我們之間的一個稱謂而已' in the sentence: '那至於這個my love，只是我們之間的一個稱謂而已，其實沒有什麼。' The correct translation should be '我親愛的' or '我愛的人'.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So, do you mean that because your colleague once studied in aboard and her thought is westernized, so the express of the emotion is very open. The phrase ”my love” means nothing, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its cultural connotations.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user fails to understand the cultural significance of the phrase '我的愛' and its implications in the context.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿!那個my love 就只是我們對彼此的稱呼，其實也沒有什麼，就是西方稱呼彼此都是這樣。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'my love' is not simply a term of endearment between friends, but rather carries a romantic connotation.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user's translation fails to recognize the cultural significance of the phrase 'my love' in Western culture, where it is commonly used as a term of endearment between romantic partners.

那她前面那句呢？
Then, what’s your explanation about the previous sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，她只是單純擔心我而已。因為我們是同事，工作壓力比較大，她當然會關心我啊!
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the woman is simply worried about the speaker, rather than expressing that she missed the speaker due to their absence.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So, do you mean that because you have not gone to work for two days and don’t assist with your course, so she sent the message to concern you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，那就是訊息的內容阿!沒有什麼其他的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the message being 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Ok, and the second message was sent at 11:55 p.m. 106/12/29 from the same person and the message was that “I want you by my side, when do we get together?”
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'truly together' as 'get together', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她只是傳這封簡訊來向我詢問說這個句子的意思與表達。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So, do you mean that your colleague sent a message to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misinterpreted the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太之前說的，我曾經修習英語教學的碩士學位，要30學分才能畢業，常常需要完成一些作業和練習，她只是幫我罷了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the requirement to complete assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
What do you study in your master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是關於英語教學的，那主要是學習英語教學，還有學習語言文化相關，還有語言能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So, do you mean that you get a master degree of English teaching and the course is combined with some culture communication?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得有三門關於文化溝通的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'three' after the verb 'were' instead of before it.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So, what kind of assignment do the culture communication courses often assign?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'often' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'often' at the end of the sentence instead of before the verb.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這個跨文化溝通的課程其實是非常的不一樣的。像我就是要尋找一個英語教學的職位，那我必須要對於中文有非常好的造詣。因此，我的作業很多都是關於英中翻譯的。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, do you mean that because you want to teach Chinese in Taiwan, so you have to finish the English courses about culture communication and the assignment is always about English-Chinese translation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific assignment being about culture communication.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，我也必須要常常精進我的寫作與口說能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word '常常' (often) from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb '常常' (often) after the verb '精進' (improve), instead of before it.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s get back to the sentence…
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was mentioned in the original text.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對的，因為我對於中文其實沒有很了解，所以我就傳了中文句子給我同事，請她幫我翻譯，然後她把中文翻好之後再用英文傳過來。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by their colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverbial phrase '因為我對於中文其實沒有很了解' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'translate' instead of 'interpret' to describe the action of their colleague.
cultural transformation	misunderstanding historical or social context	The user mentioned that some Chinese words can be difficult for foreigners to recognize, which may imply a lack of understanding of the cultural and linguistic differences between Chinese and English.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So, do you mean that the assignment you sent some Chinese sentence to your colleague and your colleague sent back the English translation? In other words, is that the answer of the translation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the meaning of the original text

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那個簡訊就是那個中文句子的翻譯解答。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '那個' (that) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '簡訊' (text message) instead of '答案' (answer).

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
The defendant, please look at the indictment 1 page 14-16 and please quickly browse these messages and I want to ask you that are these messages is all about the assignment?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'browse' instead of 'read' to describe looking at the messages.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊的傳送都是為了幫助我完成作業?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, your wife accused you for the adultery and what’s your explanation about this?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
關於這件事，我覺得我老婆想太多了。她認為我沒有能力支持家庭，而且她在我學習的時候，我老婆也從來沒有對我有任何幫助阿。因為在我就讀碩士時候，其實她沒有給我什麼幫助。那假設她能給予我幫助的話，就是不用傳那麼多訊息去尋求幫助了，所以我覺得她應該被這件事被譴責。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to the sentence from both parties, I think that your married life is not too good.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們感情的初期，其實是過的有點苦，特別是在我尋求葡萄牙文的工作時候，因為當時後收入不是很穩定。因此，我老婆對於我工作不穩定其實不諒解，我們常常因為此事而吵架。我老婆甚至沒有體諒我所遇到的挫折及遇到的困難。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
OK, let’s get back to the master degree. When did you start your master degree and when did you finish? Did you get a degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question about whether the person got a degree or not.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這個碩士學位是從2015年的四月開始。原本預計是2017年五月會取得學位，但是因為其實在過程中很少有時間去認真完成作業，所以最後還是還沒有得到學位。就像我說的，我的太太在我的求學過程中，其實沒有給我任何幫助，所以我一直都是孤單一個人去追尋我的夢想，努力取得學位，所以我非常的疲累與挫折。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So, do you mean that your master is long for two years and you didn’t finish, why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
因為我沒辦法完成所有的作業，而且還有一些課程上的要求也沒有達成。

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
Then, what's the date of the last registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
上一次最後註冊日期是2107年...
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated 'spring 2017' as '2107年' instead of '2017年'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, the courses ended at in 2017/05 and the learning should not be continued to July, then why do you still send the messages in July?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然碩士學位已經結束了，但是我還是非常積極的學中文，所以在那之後，我還是持續的學習中文，而且也非常努力的研讀。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So, do you mean that after the program, you still want to learn Chinese, so you study very hard alone, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這也就是為什麼我會尋求同事的幫忙。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '也就是' (which means 'that is') after the verb '尋求' (which means 'seek'). The correct word order should be '這也就是為什麼我尋求同事的幫忙' (This is why I seek my colleague's help).

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, in other words, your colleague played the role like your tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
對我來說，她不只是一位家教，也是一位很好的朋友?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the auxiliary verb 'has been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Then, do you pay to her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
並沒有，其實我有想要給她錢，但是她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我並沒有' instead of '並沒有我'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn't pay to her, why did she still passionate to send these messages? Isn't it clear?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the original text

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以就是我說因為她非常支持我，所以她願意花自己的時間來教我啊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以她願意花自己的時間來教我啊，因為她非常支持我。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
So, does the colleague still work there?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the workplace or service context.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，她還在那邊工作，但是我們已經沒有任何課程方面的合作了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是我們已經沒有任何合作了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any further to add or search for more information?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of witnesses or evidence in their translation.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
My honor, I want to ask the colleague of the defendant, also黃蓉兒from美而美 cram school and talks about the purpose of the messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the part about explaining the relationship between the witness and the defendant.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation leaves out the part about the background and purpose of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have something needs our assistance to investigat
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of what the accuser wants the court to investigate.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
 I have heard the美而美cram school once took action about the two person, so I want to ask about the evidence form the cram school.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide any context or details about the action taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the word 'once' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'the' before '美而美' which is incorrect.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want us to investigate?The defendant, since the master degree ended at 2017/05 but after that, you and黃蓉兒still have many interaciton and even after 9 p.m., you and黃蓉兒still send messages, so do you have any evidence want to search about this?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
關於這件事，其實我沒有什麼證據能夠提供的。就像我說的，我只是單純因為修習英語教學碩士學位的文化溝通的課程，我只是想要改進我的英文能力。

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next procedure is at 2:30 p.m., 2017/06/24 and please the defendant and the accuser come to the court. Both parties can hire a lawyer.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for love affair. Yu-han Wang filed the suit because her husband with his colleagues has some imitate messages with each other, and her husband often has some regular contact with his colleague Ron-er Huang. The defendant, your wife is going to suit you, and what’s your plea?

無罪答辯，當然。

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, we are going to see the details of the messages and to decide whether the detail is enough to make the case. Do both parties understand the procedure?

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long you married with your husband? Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'accuser' is not the correct translation for '告訴人'. It should be 'complainant' or 'plaintiff'.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve married for 4 years. We have no children.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker's husband.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'We've married' instead of 'We've been married', resulting in incorrect subject-verb agreement.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Did you marry in Taiwan, or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met with my husband in Taiwan, and he came to Taiwan here because he taught Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the duration of their meeting and the purpose of the husband's visit to Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'here' in the wrong position in the sentence.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So he taught the language is always?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
After our marriage, he kept teaching language as a language teacher. He keeps teaching. But the language is not frequent in Taiwan, so he had no steady class. Often there’s one or two months no class for him. In order to make income steady, he decided to teach English, but English is actually not his mother tongue, so he decided to go to English class.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mean the course, does it mean the degree?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '進修' as 'course' instead of 'degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wants to teach in Taiwan, so the degree he wants to get is about teaching English. The file for the America California is far distance course that allowed him to have the course from the far distance. After he gets the credit, he will get the master degree. And after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between him and this love affair object.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in a cram school. The cram school has Chinese teacher and English teacher at the same class, and the one in this love affair is the Chinese teacher in the class.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'love affair' as 'this love affair' instead of 'the one in this class'.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have love affairs?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'love affairs' instead of 'cheating'.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
When you checked the phone, did you find anything strange?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'checked' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I found a regular number in his phone, so I checked the email and I found there are many emails about the colleagues that almost contact each other every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of text messages and replaced it with emails.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
It seems common for the message, is that strange in the content in the message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If this is only a common message, that’s OK. But there are often some strange words and imitate words in the message. I have filed it to the court, that should be in the file there
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	strange words and imitate words

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
The exhibit 13, there is the content of the message. The defendant, is it from your message?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機的簡訊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I am going to request you from these messages. The first message is at 21:50 on 21st December, 2017. The number is 0958-932123. The content is “I really miss you, my love”, and what does it mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of '針對' as 'request' is incorrect. It should be translated as 'ask' or 'inquire'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'The first message was sent to your phone from the number 0958-932123 at 21:50 on 21st December, 2017. The content of the message is 'I really miss you, my love', and what does it mean?'.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封信是我同事傳給我的，我記得那時候我請了兩天假，她很擔心我，所以才傳了這封簡訊來。我的同事是接受美國教育，心胸非常開闊，那只不過是她講話的一種方式來表述自己想要表達的。「my love」只不過是一個我們對於一個在乎人所用的用法。

omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of 'my love' being a term of endearment

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
The messenger is from the US and her way to speak is so open, so ‘my love’ means nothing, is it right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the meaning of '我的愛' as 'nothing', which is incorrect.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對啊，那根本就沒有代表什麼，它只不過就是互相表達關心的詞而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, while the user's translation suggests that it simply means expressing care for each other.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the former sentence?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'former' in the translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
正如我前面所說的，我沒去上班的兩天，她很想我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker and the person mentioned are partners at work.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean she just wanted to express her concern because of your two days off. And she needed your help from class so she misses you. Only this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是啊，就這樣而已，那簡訊根本就沒什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect word choice

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second exhibit, the message at 23:55 on December 29th 2017 from the same phone, the content is ‘I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?’ and why did she send the message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳那封簡訊是想回答我那句中文是什麼意思
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean she send this message it do the homework, and what does it mean?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
在我老婆告我之前，我還有13個學分要拿，要拿到這13個學分我才能取得碩士學位，所以我還有作業和練習題要做
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the number of credits needed to complete the degree.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the completion of assignments and exercises was required to obtain the degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在我老婆告我之前' (before my wife informed the court) at the beginning of the sentence, which disrupts the natural word order.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the verb '拿' (to take) instead of '完成' (to complete), resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the present tense '要拿到' (to obtain) instead of the past tense '需要完成' (needed to complete), which is more appropriate in this context.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you explain first what did you study for the mast degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'master' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'did' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士課程大部分是英文課程，還有一些文化課程和能力課程。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of the program being TESOL.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我的碩士課程' (my master's courses) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'In that program'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'TESOL' as '碩士課程' (master's courses) instead of '英文教學' (English teaching).
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate 'culture and language competence' in the sentence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
You mean the degree you get is for English teaching but there are other culture and communication courses

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是啊，我記得至少有3堂是文化與溝通的課程。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'related to' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '至少' (at least) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what the assignment did they give you in the culture and communication courses?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這門課文化與溝通的課程每個學生的作業都不太一樣，像我是待台灣，我就必須要證明我可以精準的駕馭中文，還有我的中文能力這樣子。因此我中文很多都是中英翻譯。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '還有我的中文能力這樣子' which is not present in the original text
minor categories of grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我中文很多都是中英翻譯'
minor categories of grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation at the end of the sentence

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean because you have to teach Taiwanese English so you have to prove your Chinese ability so there are a lot of Chinese and English assignments for you, is it?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是啊，我的確有必要去精進我的口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So is it your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
中文字對我來說就是有幾個字很難辨認，所以我就寄了這封簡訊給她，請她翻譯過來。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was mentioned in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '寄' (send) before the object '這封簡訊' (this message), which is incorrect in English.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '簡訊' (text message) instead of '句子' (sentence) in the translation.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean this message is only the answer of the assignment. You sent the Chinese words to her and she brought the Chinese answer to you, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就只是我作業的解答而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'just' before 'only' in the translation, which is incorrect.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
The exhibit 1, page 14 to 16, are these all the answers to your assignments? You sent them because your assignment?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'text messages' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect in the translation.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊全部都是作業要用的。

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
How do you explain about the love affair your wife filed
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific accusation made by the wife.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我覺得我太太真的是想太多了，我知道她覺得我沒有能力撫養家庭。因為他都不支持我這個碩士學位，所以我只好問我同事，如果她肯支持我一點，我就不用問我同事了，我覺得她必須為這整個誤會負責。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, is that any unpleasant situations between you and your wife?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們一開始還不錯，但可能是教葡萄牙語的關係，可能就…。自從開始教葡萄牙語，工作的關係就一直起爭執，她覺得我都一直沒有盡我的力去工作，但其實我經常遇到挫折，我都沒辦法跟她說

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Back to what you said about the master degree, when did the master degree begin, and has it finished and do you get the degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015開始，預計2017年結束，但因為我一直有在兼職，所以我一直無法完成我的碩士課程。就像我說的，我太太一點都不支持我，我必須獨力完成這個學位，我覺得很累很挫折挫敗。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean the degree is for 2 years, but you didn’t fish it, why?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not completing the degree.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒有辦法完成所有課程作業，還有一些課程必修。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out 'all' in 'I couldn't finish all the course assignments'
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out 'also' in 'I couldn't finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我沒有辦法完成所有課程作業'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '還有一些課程必修'

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So the registration for the semester, when did it end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後一個學期是2017年的春季。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '的' before '春季'

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If you said is true, you mean the last registration is last until May 2107, and there will not be any assignments for you, but the messages between you and your colleague remained 7 months afterwards, could you explain why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒能完成我的學位，並不代表我不想繼續精進我的中文能力，為了繼續精進中文能力，所以我一直有在試圖傳簡訊增進中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean even though you didn’t finish the master degree, you still want to improve your Chinese ability and make your Chinese fluent more, is it right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
那就是我問我同事的目的，希望她幫我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the colleague plays the role of a house teacher for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the meaning of '家教' as 'house teacher' instead of 'tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，還是我的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject 'you' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我想要付，但她婉拒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我想要付' instead of '我要想付'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t her, why did she send the messages in the middle of the night? Doesn’t that exceed the relationship between you and the colleague?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是我說她為什麼總是這麼支持我，用盡所有的時間來教我中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the friend using her own time to help learn Chinese.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still teaching in that school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the type of school, which is a critical context.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還繼續在那邊上班。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is this colleague working there, too?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'also' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她也繼續在在那邊教書，但我們不再是一個團隊了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '在那邊教書' instead of '在在那邊教書'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. It should be '我們不再是一個團隊了' instead of '我們不再是一個團隊了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
 Prosecutor, is there any witness you want to subpoena or you want to investigate something?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena Ron-er Huang, the colleague from Mei-er-Mi cram school as a witness and asked her about the relationship with the man and the purpose to send the message.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have anything you want the court to investigate.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the court in their translation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that school have taken action for the relationship between my husband and Ron-er Huang. I want this investigation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific actions taken by the school.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the necessary context for the investigation.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence about trying to convince Huang Ron-er to resign.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the word 'husband' which is not mentioned in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you want the court to investigate something for you? Now your master degree ended at June, 2017, you didn’t have any reason to send these messages with your colleagues. That’s really strange and especially these messages sent from your colleague were mostly sent after 9 pm, do you anything you want the court to investigate for you?

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong translation of '希望'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '做作業'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有想到什麼法院可以為我調查的證據，我只是像要加強我的中文能力罷了。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court is set at 4:30 pm on June 24th, 2018 and to subpoena the witness. The accuser and defendant have to be there. Both of you can have a lawyer.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re here for the preparation procedure for an adultery case. The accuser 宇涵王, she claimed that her husband… has an affair… her husband Edward Kapayashi has an affair with his coworker in his cram school. The accuser found some intimate messages in her husband cell phone, and all that messages showed her husband has more than… a relationship more than a coworker with her colleagues… and her husband often make up reasons for another worktime… and tele-conferencing in dark night. The defendant, your wife filed the lawsuit on you for adultery. What’s your plea?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparation procedure, the court will investigate the details in the messages from your cell phone and we will consider that the messages are enough to constitute an adultery. And we will ask questions of you two. Do you both understand?

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have any child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun 'you' should be capitalized.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'accuser' does not accurately convey the meaning of '告訴人' which means 'complainant' or 'plaintiff'.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years. We don’t have any child.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'husband' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the plural form 'we' with the singular verb 'don't'. It should be 'we don't have any children'.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Are you married in Taiwan? Or other place?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the user's spouse.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan four years ago. He came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is also from Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase 'four years ago' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'met'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '想要' as 'to teach' instead of 'to learn'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past years, did he work as an Portuguese teacher?

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
The time we met, he was an Portuguese teacher, and now he’s still teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese in Taiwan is not popular with people, so his teaching-hours are often not stable. (yeah… not stable… from one to two hours per week…) After that in order to make his income more stable, so he decided to teach English as well. But English is not his mother tongue, so he tried to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just said that (X2) he wanted to… your husband wanted to seek an advanced degree. That means get an degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, I mean he wants to… teach English, so the degree he needs is about a teaching qualification. My husband found a distance learning program on-line and it is a program from California, the United States. And the program provides on-line learning so that he doesn’t need to go to the USA and he can learn English on teaching… for teaching. After he finished his class, got his… all the credits he needs, he can… could obtain the master degree in the USA, and he can use the degree to teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then, the relationship between your husband and the person he has affair with… what is the relationship?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are coworkers in a cram school. The cram school… the class in the cram school needs a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher to teach English together. The affair person is the Chinese teacher.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'did' before the subject 'you' instead of after.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I often ask my husband why did he always stay up late in the cram school. It’s just an English class. There’s no need for staying up late in the cram school, but my husband told me that he had something to discuss with his Chinese teacher… for teaching. I did not… doubt my husband at first, but days pass… days has passed, my husband would get some calls in our home after getting off the cram school, and he will answer the phone into… in his study room so I have no choice but to doubt him.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything inordinary stuffs… messages?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
There is a same num… a very same number in his phone record so I checked my husband cell phone’s messages, and I found that my husband chatted with the woman very often.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of being curious about the content of the messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'chatted' instead of 'texted', which changes the meaning.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
It just… they are just text messages. Anything not okay?
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate the phrase '內容很不恰當' which means 'inappropriate content'.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they are some work stuff messages, that’s okay. I found very intimate words the woman used to text in the message, and my husband is married with me, you know, so that’s quite not okay.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please display the exhibit file on page 13. The accuser, are these your… the messages you said…

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這就是…這些是我手機上的訊息。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Well then I am going to ask you some questions about these messages. The first message was sent at 09:50 p.m. on December 21st, 2017 from the cell phone number 0958-932123, and the message said, “I miss you, my love”, what do you want to say?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那只是我同事發給我的訊息啊。我記得我那時候剛好放了兩天假，我同事就只是關心我而已啊。我同事在美國讀書然後畢業…在美國接受教育的，所以她的思想相對也是開放許多。我們就…平常打打鬧鬧的…我們對於在乎的人會說my love這樣。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	adding unnecessary information
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So you mean that your coworker is westernized on his… her thoughts and her expression for feelings because she got the education in the US, so “my love” is nothing special?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' instead of 'the sender' or 'the person'.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
沒錯，那就只是…對於在乎的人所傳達的關心方式，真的沒有什麼。
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural meaning of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous sentence… in the message?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific content of the previous sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，我們就是同事。然後她很…比較擔心我一點，因為我兩天都沒去上班去放假這樣。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was worried about them.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the information about the speaker being away for two days before mentioning that the speaker is partners with the other person at work.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that… your coworker she is quite… she missed you because you have two day-off and there is no assistance on teaching…
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對，訊息的內容就是這樣，它的意思也是這樣。
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation does not include the critical context of the message being 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent from the same… the exact same number at 11:55 p.m. on December 29th, 2017. The content is… writes as when can she be with you… “I want you so bad…”
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她這樣說只是為了告訴我，我在…我的一個…我剛剛寫到一個中文的作業要怎樣表達這樣…要怎樣表達一個豐富情感的句子。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the message, such as the content of the Chinese sentence and the purpose of expressing a rich emotion.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect and does not follow the proper word order in Chinese.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '豐富情感' to translate 'express a sentence', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You saying that she sent you the message to help you on your assignment...? What are you talking about?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像之前…先前我老婆跟你們講的…我太太跟你們講的，我正在攻讀一個英語教學的碩士學位，而我需要30個學分才可以完成這個學位，所以在這之前有一些習作也是很正常的。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you first explain your… what exactly you are preparing for the degree.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位是有關TESOL這個英語教學的系統…然後裡面除了英語教學外，也有一些文化相關的課程…或是語言能力相關的課程。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So, the program you take needs not… has not only TESOL or… and courses about culture…communication…
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	not accurately translating the cultural aspect

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對啊，有至少三個是有關文化溝通的課程。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of courses in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '有' (have) after the verb '是' (to be), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '有關' (related to) instead of '有關於' (about), which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What kind of assignment the courses will need you to complete?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通的課程對每個人來說…每個人選的都有點不同，像我現在住在台灣，而且我準備要來教英文，所以我會需要這個…會需要一些能力在中文上。所以囉，我的一些作業就是有關中英翻譯的一些句子。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, according to your words, the program you need… and you need to translate some sentences between Chinese and English, right?

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對，我也需要精進我的閱讀跟寫作的能力在中文方面。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'speaking' skills in their translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'writing' skills in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在中文方面' at the end of the sentence instead of after '我也需要精進'.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s get back to the sentence. It is one of your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是啊，我讀到了一些句子，可是你也知道有一些中文字對外國人來說就是比較難理解，所以我請我的同事翻譯給我…翻譯成英文給我，讓我去明白句子的意思。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by their colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not in the correct order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'read' instead of 'got' to describe their interaction with the Chinese sentences.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user mentioned that some Chinese words are difficult for foreigners to recognize, which may imply a misunderstanding of the cultural context of the Chinese language.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Well, you are telling me that you ask your coworker to translate the sentence into English… from Chinese to English for you, and that is the answer… and then send text message to you as the answer for your exercises?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text, specifically the part about asking the coworker for the translation and receiving it via text message.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'from Chinese to English' instead of 'Chinese to English for you'.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那個就只是我功課的…那個訊息就只是我功課的解答。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'answer' in their translation, which is a critical detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '只是' (only) in the wrong position in their translation. It should come after the verb '是' (is).

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
The defendant, we will go on to show you the file on page… the exhibit on page 14 to 16. So these are all part of your homework, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific content of the text messages on pages 14 to 16.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'the exhibit on page 14 to 16' in the middle of the sentence instead of at the end.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，這些所有看到的句子都是在幫助我完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then, in terms of the affair your wife accused you, what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's accusation in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
對此，我真的是覺得我太太真的是想太多了，我真的沒有做什麼。而且我也只是想讓自己可以更支持這個家這樣。而且庭上，請你知道，我在進修的時候我太太是完全沒給任何精神支持的。我太太真的是沒有幫助我太多，如果她能對於我在進修這件…進修英文這件事上，提供更多的協助的話，我也就不需要拜託我的同事來協助我，她才是那個需要被責怪的人。而且還造成這些誤解，真的很抱歉。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your words, there’s… there seems to be unpleasure… unhappiness between you and your wife.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong translation of 'unpleasure'

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們剛…結婚沒多久的時候，我們都還…相處地都還很愉快很融洽，可是我的工作就是很不穩定，尤其在授課時數方面，因為真的沒什麼人要學葡萄牙文。所以漸漸地我們常為了我的工作而爭吵，我老婆都不知道我做了多少努力在想要去好好地維持這份工作上，而她也完全不知道我有多挫敗在遭遇了這些失敗上。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s get back to your program. When did it start? When did it end? (Do you know? And can you tell us?)
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question about whether the person obtained a degree or not.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2015年秋天開始了…開始去參與這個課程，它是個兩年期的課程。原本預計是在2017年5月會結束，可是我陸陸續續地在打工啊什麼的，所以我也是沒有完成這個學位這樣。就像我說的，我太太在對於我…進修英文這方面真的是沒有給予很大的支持，日子久了我也就感到很疲倦因為讓我覺得我是自己在奮鬥的這樣子，我真的很灰心。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You’re saying that the course is a two-year course. But why did you… didn’t you accomplish it?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
因為我沒辦法完成所有課程的作業。還有一些課程相關的規定。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So when is the last semester of your registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後一個學期是在2017年的春天。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added unnecessary information

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
We know that your course ended in May 2017, then after this… after all of this, why… why those messages can… will show up in your text messages record…
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我沒辦法完成我的學業，也不代表我不想要精進我的中文能力。所以我為了更精進它，所以我就是自己繼續學下去這樣。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
According to that, even if you did not finish the course, you still want to make progress in your Chinese, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
對啊，這就是為什麼我才要向我同事尋求協助。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '啊' (a particle used for emphasis) after the verb '對' (yes), which is incorrect in this context.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '尋求' (seek) instead of '請求' (ask) to convey the meaning of asking for help.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
Well, the role your coworker play is kind of tutor of your Chinese?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor of your Chinese' instead of 'private tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅僅是我的中文家教，她真的是一個很好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her for the tutor?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific context of paying for the tutor.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有…我有試著要付錢給她，可是她說不用。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'offered' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '沒有' (no) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb '有試著' (tried).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '說不用' (said no need) instead of '拒絕' (declined).

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
Well, you didn’t pay her. But why did she text you in such night… That is telling that you are beyond coworkers’ relationships?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以囉，我說，她真的是很幫助我的一個朋友。尤其花了…犧牲了她那些時間來幫助我學中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the friend sacrificing her own time.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work as an English teacher in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'work' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'still' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'work'.

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我依然在那裏就職。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'working' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '依然' (still) before the verb '在' (be) instead of after it.

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
So do your coworker?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她依然在那邊上班，但我們已經不再是教學的夥伴了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們已經不再是教學的夥伴了' instead of '但我們已經不再是夥伴的教學了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, any more witness or any further evidence needed to be investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Are there any more witnesses or further evidence that needs to be investigated?'

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
Your honor, I would like to subpoena the defendant’s coworker 蓉兒黃 at his 美而美 cram school. I would like to ask her about the detail and the intention about those messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the information about the relationship between the witness and the defendant, as well as the background and purpose of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, anything you want… is there anything you want the court to investigate?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has take some… has taken action for the incident my husband and his coworker… and I even heard that the cram school asked his coworker to step out of the work.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the cram school towards the husband's coworker.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'has take' instead of 'has taken'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide enough context to understand the incident involving the husband and his coworker.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'and I even heard that' which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase 'asked his coworker to step out of the work' which is not present in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
And the defendant, is there anything you want the court to help you investigate? It is a fact that the defendant your course is… your courses ended May 2017, so there’s no need about the assignment stuff you need to deal with, and that makes those messages quite dubious because you received them in the really night and that is quite out of control.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我真的沒有什麼證據想要法院為我調查。就…一直都像我說的，我跟她會聊天，真的是單純就是我想精進我的中文，因為我真的想繼續學它這樣。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the adultery case. The plaintiff, Yu Han Wang, he sued his husband Edward for that he had a…he had an affair with his colleague in a cram school, 王柔兒, they not only have intimate message, and…but also Edward usually make up reasons for having extra work; moreover, they also have tele-conferencing, and their relationship is beyond coworker’s relationship.

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Now I am going to ask the plaintiff. How long have you married with your husband. Do you have any children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I have been married with my husband and…for four years, and we don’t have any children.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
And did you married in Taiwan or in other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met with my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that they are married.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'met' before the subject 'I', instead of using the correct word order 'I met'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'with' instead of 'to' when translating '跟' which means 'to' in this context.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in these years, does he…did  he teach Portuguese as his work?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. And after we got married, he continues to teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hour is not steady, and sometime his…he had a period between jobs for about one or two months.  Because teaching Portuguese is not a steady work, he decided to teach English, and because his mother tongue is not English, he went to seek an advance degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that he… seek an advance degree. Do you mean that he had…studied for a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he needs a degree in English teaching. He..he had a distance learning program which is from California in the United States, and…and the learning is a distance online learning, so he can learn…he can learn in Taiwan, and also…therefore, through the credits from the online program, he can get the master degree in English teaching, and then he can teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then what is the relationship between your husband and the so call affair…the person he had affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleague. They…they work in a same cram school, and the cram had a program to have a foreign teacher and a Taiwanese teacher and to be partner with teaching, and she is the person who partner with him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'know' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, my husband usually make up reasons for having extra work and stay in the cram school. I asked him for the reason, and he said that he has to communicate with the Taiwanese teacher to talk more about their work. But I think he’s just a English teacher, why he have to stay in the cram school for so long. At first, I didn’t suspect him, but he started to have some phone calls after his work, and moreover, when he pick up the calls, he would avoid me and went to the study room. And I started to suspect him and check up his cell phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So did you find anything wrong with his cell phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of what was wrong with the cell phone.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I check his phone call record and saw that he almost had phone call with the same person every day. And then I check his text…I check his message and see that he text with the same person with a woman almost every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
I think texting people is not a very unusual thing. So is there anything wrong with the messages.
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	ignoring cultural norms of communication

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
I think the message with ordinary content is fine. But he is a man…but he had got married, and how can he have message with some intimate content with other people. I had provided some information about their message, and I think all the evidence are in the files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '已婚的人' as 'he had got married' instead of 'he is married'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the critical context of providing evidence to the court by not mentioning that the messages were given to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
So the…so the file and is the message you mean on the phone call text?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些就是我手機上的內容。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I am going to ask you based on these…these contents. The first message is…was sent from the cell phone 0958-932123 on 21:50…at 21:50 on 12/21 in 2017, and the content is “I really miss you”. What does this mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I really miss you' is incorrect.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
痾那就只是同事寄給我的簡信。那個時候我剛請了兩天假，他很擔心，所以才寄這樣的簡訊給我。我的同事他之前在美國讀過書，所以她的表達方式也比較開放，這就是他說話的方式，就像是說「我的愛」這樣子，這都是很正常的表達方式。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added unnecessary information
minor categories of grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
minor categories of cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	misinterpreted the meaning of 'my love'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So you mean that because this person has stayed in the foreign countries and his…her concept is westernized, so…her expression is just this kind of opened,  and it’s very ordinary and this is nothing wrong with her words, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'just this kind of opened' and 'very ordinary', which does not convey the intended meaning of the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對，那就只是普通…那種表達方式很普通，就只是好朋友或是很親密的朋友間的表達方式。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other' is not present in the user's translation.

那她前面那句呢？
So what about the sentence he sent you…she sent you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical context of the sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，我們是同事，在我…在我請了兩天假之後，他當然會很想念我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the woman being worried about the speaker.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在我請了兩天假之後' (after I took two days off) in the wrong position in the sentence.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So do you mean that the other party sent you this message is just because you are out of work for two days, and he miss you and he miss you because she work without your assistance in class, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，那個簡訊內容並沒有甚麼問題。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
And let’s see the second message. That’s from the same person’s cell phone and the time was at 23:55 on12/29,2017, and message content is 我很想要你在我身邊，你甚麼時候可以在我身邊呢? I…So what do you think about this message. What does it mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation incorrectly uses the word '想要' which means 'want' instead of '想' which means 'want' or 'miss'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '你什麼時候可以在我身邊呢?' instead of '你甚麼時候可以在我身邊呢?'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他會寄給我那封簡訊是因為他想教我要怎麼表達這樣子的意思。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他會寄給我那封簡訊' instead of '他會寄給我那封簡訊是'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after '簡訊' in the translation. The correct translation should be '他會寄給我那封簡訊，' instead of '他會寄給我那封簡訊是'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '意思' in the translation is not the correct word choice to express 'message'. The correct translation should be '訊息' instead of '意思'.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that the reason why she sent you this message was because she wanted to help you with your assignment? What does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就如同我老婆之前在法庭上說的，我有一個碩士學位的一個計劃，在那個計劃裡我要…需要拿到三十個學分，這就是拿到學分的其中一個作業，他只是協助我完成這個作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about completing assignments and exercises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '這就是拿到學分的其中一個作業' in the wrong position in the sentence.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
So please explain what master degree are you…did you get?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'did' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'are' before 'you' instead of after 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是英語教學，然後他有一部份是關於英文，另外一部份是關於文化還有語言能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the specific mention of courses.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation uses '碩士學位' (master's degree) instead of '課程' (courses).
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'TESOL'.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you mean that the master degree you get was TESOL, and it includes some language competence ability, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
cultural transformation	misunderstanding historical or social context	The translation misinterprets the context of the original text.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的。我記得至少三堂課是跟文化還有語言能力有關溝通…能力有關。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what was the assignment in the…in the cultural and communication courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing question mark

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通課程出的作業是因人而異的，像我是一個在台灣然後想要在台灣能夠教英文的人，我的作業就要去展現出我對中文有多麼了解。所以我的作業有很多都是關於中英的翻譯。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '關於中英的' (about Chinese-English)

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean that because you wanted to teach English in Taiwan, your assignments from the master degree is usually about translating the sentences between Chinese and English, and your assignments was to finish these translation and to…and to express how well you did in Chinese.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，除此之外，我還必須展現我的… 精進我的閱讀跟寫作能力
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok, let’s get back to the message, so you mean the message is your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，那就是我的作業。你知道有的時候中文字對外國人來說是很困難的，所以我寄給她…所以我寄給她那句話請她幫我翻譯。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
minor categories of grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
minor categories of semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you mean you sent her the sentence in English and she sent you back the sentence in Chinese and…and the sentence is just the answer of your assignment, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就只是我作業的解答。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Ok, let’s see the… show the page 14 to 16 on file one and check the message content…contents, and are these messages all the answer about your…all the answer to your assignment?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊都是為了完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
How do you explain to your wife’s…to your wife’s words that she said you have an affair with your colleague?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我覺得我太太想太多了，我覺得他只是不滿意我在這個家庭裡面的付出，但是在我一開始學習的時候他也沒有給我任何的支持或支援。他在我拿到…他在我拿碩士學位的過程中，也並沒有展現要支持我的意思，這也是為甚麼我要轉而尋求我同事的協助，那都是因為他根本就不支持我，我覺得他應該為這件事情負責
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your words, is there anything wrong with your relationship between your wife and you?

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們一開始剛結婚的時候，我們的確相處得很好，但是後來因為我工作的關係，我一開始沒有辦法有穩定的工作時數。因此，工作這件事情就成為我們爭吵的主要原因，我們為了這件事情已經爭吵了非常多次，我也覺得很沮喪，但是也沒有甚麼發洩的方法。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok, let’s get back to the…your master degree. When did you started to study for the master degree, and when…when did you get this degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'start' in the question about when the master degree program started.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'finish' in the question about when the master degree program ended.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'degree' in the question about whether the user obtained the master degree.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2015秋天的時候開始這個碩士學位課程，並且本應要在2017年的五月拿到學位，但是因為我…並且本來應該…並且這是一個兩年課程，我本來應要在2017年的五月拿到學位，但是因為我自己還有申請其他工作，所以就沒有足夠的時間完成這個學位。就像我說的，我太太在這件事情上面並沒有很支持我，所以就變成好像是我一個人在完成這件事情，讓我覺得很累，讓我很累也很沮喪。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So you mean the degree…the program is two years and you didn’t finish it on time, so what is the reason?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
因為我並沒有完成所有的課程的作業。還有一些課程的要求。

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So when was the last semester that you registered?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後一個有註冊的學期是2017年的春天。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '的' before '春天'

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So you mean that you have finish your… study program on…in May in 2017 but you continue to text your colleague for over 7 months after your study, so what is the reason?

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成這個學位，但是也並不代表說我就沒有再繼續學習了，雖然我沒有完成學位，但是我還是想要去精進我的語言，所以我才會在停止這個學習計畫之後，繼續跟我同事詢問相關的。

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that even if you didn’t finish the program, you still continue to keep studying Chinese and wanted to make your Chinese more influent, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是，那就是我為甚麼跟我同事尋求幫助。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'for help' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'asked'.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the position of your colleague is just like your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不僅是像家教一樣，還是我的非常好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Then did you paid her?

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
不，我想要付給她錢，但是他拒絕了。

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. '但是他拒絕了' should be translated as 'but she refused' instead of 'but he refused'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If…if you didn’t pay her, then why did she answer your message at midnight at such a time that people should go to bed? I think the relationship is beyond the…an ordinary period.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是我說的他非常的支持我，然後也是我非常好的朋友，而且他都用自己的時間來幫助我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她非常支持我' instead of '他非常支持我'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' is used instead of '她', which changes the gender of the person being referred to.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？

Yes, I am still working there.

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
他還在那邊繼續工作，但是我們並沒有在一起搭檔。

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you need to have any people here, or you want to see any evidence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to have 王柔兒, who is the colleague work with the defendant in 美而美cram school, to be here to explain the messages and the relationship between the defendant and her.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The plaintiff, do you need anything the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the existence of any evidence that the plaintiff wants the court to investigate.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that 美而美 cram school took some action to this… and they even try to persuade the 王柔兒to quit her job. I want to check if this thing is true or false.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you need anything the court to investigate for you? The situation is that you have already finish your… finish the program in May in 2017, and you… keep on having messages with 王柔兒and almost the messages are after 9 p.m. at night, and it’s really not an ordinary situation. So what… evidence can you offer to the court to help yourself?

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有任何法庭...需要法庭來幫我調查的事情，但是就像我所說的，我只是想要精進自己的中文能力，然後跟我的同事也只是非常單純的關係。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
The defendant, you have been prosecuted of ……an adultery case, and today is the preparatory procedure. The accuser, Yu-Han Wang, filed the lawsuit because…he, she found her husband, Edward Takayashi, was ……too, close to his co-worker, which was, ugh …Rong-Er Huang in…the working place. And Edward Takayashi, the …defendant, umm …… often …make up reasons for working for extra time, and the accuser found in the defendant’s cellphone that there are some intimate messages with this Rong-Er Huang. And the accuser think that they are beyond the co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, she filed this lawsuit.The defendant, your wife ……suspected that you …have an adultery, you have an …you have an affair with others. What’s your plea?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, ugh …the main goal is to …investigate …the message between the defendant and his co-worker. Do you both …do both party understand?

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
And ……are you married in Taiwan, or you get married in foreign countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan, and he want to taught Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'he wanted to teach Portuguese' instead of 'he want to taught Portuguese.'

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past few years, ugh his work in Taiwan is to teach Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'ugh' does not make sense in this context.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, ugh he was a Protu …Portuguese teacher. And …ugh after we get married …we got married, ugh… he kept teaching Portuguese.Ugh because there are not very ……very much person in Taiwan want to learn Portuguese, so ugh his teaching hours were not very stable, sometimes umm …there are only few hours, and …umm even one or two months.And …ugh in order to let his income more stable, he started to want to teach English. However, English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he …want to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean that he want to …earn another degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, I mean ugh because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan. So, ugh his degree must be somehow related to English teaching,Ugh he found a distance learning program on the Internet, which ugh …was provided by …umm California in American …America. So therefore, he didn’t have to go out, then he can ugh …he can a..a..achieve his learning through the distance learning.So after he …finished …all his …umm …scores and umm …lessens, he would get his …a master degree, so he didn’t need to go to the United States, but he can get his degree and teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then what is the relationship between your husband and the person he  had an affair with this time?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school. And ugh that cram school, umm… has, ugh …required ugh …all the teachers partner with another one, to ugh make a Chinese teacher partner with a foreign teacher, And that person was his Chinese teacher in his class.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything you think is not normal in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
Umm ……it is ugh …phone records, ugh … there are not ugh … there are not anything …anything …unnormal. Therefore I checked his umm text message, and found out that he often text with another person …another woman, and always umm …almost every day.

Even if he sent text message, it’s quite alright …right? Or …if the contents in the messages is not proper?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If the message …the text messages are just something normal, I won’t be like …like this. However, ugh …his was a married man, so why …ugh did the woman send some very intimate words to him? I think I have provided some of his text message in …ugh, to the court. And there are …I think there are in the files.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是，這是我寄過的簡訊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cell phone' in the translation.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Well, then I want to ask some questions …umm ……toward these messages.The first message was sent at …ugh, 9:50 PM on December 21st, 2017, and it was sent by a phone number, 0958932123, to your phone. And the content is “我真的好想你呀，我的愛人。” What does this mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那是我一個同事寄給我的訊息。我記得那時候我請了兩天假，那就是為什麼她寄這封簡訊給我。我同事是受美國教育的，所以她的個性非常的開放，她講話都是這樣。然後至於那個「my love」，那只是我們互稱我們關心的人的方式。

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague being open-minded.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'my love' being a way to refer to people they care about.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Ugh so you mean that this colleague was westernized, so ……her expressions are open-minded, so umm …you don’t think this message is not proper, right? Is that true?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not properly handle the cultural context of the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
沒有。這只是一個非常一般朋友打招呼的方式。我們對關心的人、朋友，就是這樣。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, while the user's translation simply states that it is a general way for friends to greet each other.

那她前面那句呢？
Then how about ……the forward line?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific content of the forward line.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我已經說過了。我們是同事，我們在那家補習班是搭檔。那時候我請了兩天假，所以當然，她…她會想我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Did you say that because you took a two-days off, so without your …ugh help in her class, she ……was quite missing you. Is that right? Is that only …is that the only thing? Is that simply like that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing punctuation marks
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Misinterpretation of the word 'missing'

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對，我就是這樣說的。那個簡訊…就只是這樣而已，沒什麼大不了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in their translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'no big deal' as '沒什麼大不了', which does not convey the same casual tone as the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, so …the second message. It was sent at, ugh 11:55 PM on December 29th, 2017 from the same phone number. And the ……context was, ”I want you by my …ugh, 我想要你在我身邊，我們什麼時候才能真正地在一起？” What does this mean this time?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'truly together'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她是想要幫助我寫這個句子，因為我那時候在寫一個中文的功課。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Did you say that ……ugh, the …ugh this person sent you this message because she wanted to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
我妻子剛剛也在…呃…她的……她被問問題的時候說過了。我正在修一個碩士學程，呃，為了要修完這個學程，我必須要修滿30個學分。所以我當然有一些作業要做。

Would you please explain first that ho …ugh what is your major for the master degree?

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是英語教學。嗯，那個碩士學位，呃有一些部分是跟英語教學有關，其他部分跟文化和語言能力有關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
Ugh, so your master degree is TESOL, however, there are something in that related to culture and language competence. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
cultural transformation	misunderstanding historical or social context	The translation misinterprets the meaning of the original text in relation to cultural and social context.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是，我記得有三堂課跟文化與溝通有關。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'at least' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'related' before the subject 'three courses' instead of after.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'related to' as '有關' which means 'related' but doesn't convey the same meaning as 'related to' in English.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
Then about this kind of courses related to culture and communication, ugh what assignments would these courses, ugh, required you to ……achieve? to complete?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
呃，這種文化與溝通課程給每個人的作業都不太一樣。就舉我自己的例子而言，因為我是一個在台灣的外國人，然後想要，嗯…在台灣得到…可以、可以教英文的能力，所以我必須要表現出我對中文的…掌握能力。所以我很多的作業都是跟中英翻譯有關。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Well, you mean that because you plan to teach English in Taiwan. So umm … these courses ugh … required you to complete some assignments, and these assignments are related to Chinese and English sentences translation. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The translation lacks proper punctuation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation uses incorrect words.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的。另外我也要精進自己的口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay then let’s go back to ……the text … the text message. Did you say that this …is …your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得那時候我看到這個句子的時候，我不是很能理解它到底在寫什麼。你也知道的，對外國人來說，中文字有一些非常地難以閱讀、難以辨認，所以我就給我的同事看了這個句子，然後請她告訴我這句話用英文怎麼說，並把它打成簡訊寄給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Did you mean that, ugh…because you asked your co-worker to …told you the answer of this sentence …the translation of this sentence and send you a text message to, ugh …for the answer, so this message was simply the answer of your assignment? Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'ugh' instead of accurately translating the original text
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of '作業' as 'assignment' instead of 'homework'

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那條簡訊只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '那條' (that) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Okay then let’s ugh …take a look at exhibit evidence one, page 14, the text messages contexts. Could you …ugh …take a look at those contents? Are they all …related to your assignment? Are these all because of ugh …you need the answers for your assignment? So you sent these messages?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	repetition of phrases
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，全部的簡訊都只是為了要完成作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the messages being referred to.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then ugh …according to what your wife just said that you had an affair with another person, do you have anything to say?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'ugh' which is an interjection expressing hesitation or discomfort.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the interjection 'ugh' in the middle of the sentence instead of at the beginning.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
呃，對這件事，我認為我的妻子想太多了。我知道她一直對我無法支持這個家庭經濟的能力感到失望、不滿；但我想說的是，從我開始上這、這、這個課程到現在，我的妻子也沒有提供我任何幫…任何支持。她從來都沒有…表現出支持我的樣子，對於我念碩士這一件事情。那就是為什麼我會尋求我的同事幫助我做作業。如果她可以多一…表現出多一點點支持，我可能就不會尋求我同事了。我認為，關於這件事情，她應該要受到責備。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you just said, you and your wife seem to be not ugh …very …accordance in your getting along with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們剛結婚的時候，我們確實滿快樂的。但後來出現了問題，而這問題就是關於我的工作。因為我想在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是這份工作又不太穩定。於是後來這件事情就變成我們之間的問題。我們常常為了這個吵架，她不相信我已經盡我最大的努力，所以…我也沒有讓她知道我所面臨的艱難處境以及…困難的狀況。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Well, okay. Then let’s go back to …ugh, the master …courses you …just mentioned …about. So did you finish your master courses, all of your credits? Did you get the master degree?

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這個碩士是從2015年的秋天開始的。然後它是一個兩年的碩士學位，所以我應該要在2017年的5月完成這個學位。但是我並沒有完成。因為我又開始做一些兼職工作，所以我一直沒有時間可以好好地完成我的作業。就像我剛所說的，我的太太並沒有ㄕ…表示出任何的支持。所以在追求這個碩士學位的時候，我覺得我是一個人在讀這個學位的。我覺得非常地沮喪與挫折。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You said that this master degree is ugh …a two-year courses program, but you didn’t finish and complete it in the end. Why is that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
因為我無法完成所有的作業。也無法達到一部分要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
Then …ugh for the registration ……of this master degree, what is the last ……semester?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
嗯我最後一個學期，是……2017年的春天。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If the things you’ve said is true, then ugh …your assignments should have been …ugh, in an …should have been an end in May, 2017. However, after 7 months ugh in December, you and your co-worker’s messages are continuing. Why is that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omission of details	omission of specific details in the translation

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
即使我無法完成我的碩士學位，但我仍然想精進我的中文能力。所以雖然我沒有辦法成功地拿到碩士，我…仍然繼續自己研讀中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of failing the program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '所以' (so) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '我' (I).

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You …ugh, what do you mean is that, even if you can’t …ugh get your master degree, you still wanted to …sharper your Chinese ……and let your Chinese be more fluently. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
沒錯，那就是為什麼我…請我的同事幫忙。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '沒錯' (correct) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the comma.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the co, co, colleague, this colleague, ……ugh the role she played was ugh …somehow like your …homeroom teacher?
grammar and structure	word order errors	repetition and hesitation in the translation

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，她還是我一個真正的好友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Then did you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the pronoun 'you' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the past tense 'did' for the verb 'pay', but the original text does not indicate past tense.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有欸，我有提出我想要給她錢的要…呃，我我有、我有…
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	repetition of phrases

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If she declined, then why …ugh did that … she still send messages in the midnight? I think this is somehow ugh …be more to her ……responsibility?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'ugh' instead of a proper word

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個…我非常好的朋友，也很支持我。她會用她自己的時間來幫助我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我才說她是一個非常好的朋友，也很支持我。'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of learning Chinese in the translation, which is a critical detail in the original text.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still working in that cram school teaching English?

Yes, I am still working there.
是，我還在那工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
And is this colleague still work with you in the cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'there' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'still' in the wrong position in the sentence.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她也還在那工作，但我們現在不是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們現在不是搭檔了' instead of '但我們現在了不是搭檔'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have ugh ……any witness you want to subpoena, or any evidence you want to ins …investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing punctuation mark in the sentence.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
Ugh I hope to subpoena …the co …ugh the defendant’s co-worker to come to the court, which is ugh …the Rong-Er Huang, ugh …works, works in the cram school 美而美 to come here to explain her relationship with the defendant and also explain those messages, what is her goal and her background to send these messages.

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'further' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'any'.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I’ve heard that …ugh the cram school have taken some actions toward my husband and his co-worker’s relationship. I think the cram school has convinced Rong-Er Huang to …ugh …resign for his job. So I …I’ve wondered …ugh wondered if the cram school could …ugh …could prove this.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	repetition of phrases

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我現在想不到任何需要法院為我調查的證據。呃…我已經說了，我和我同事之間的簡訊真的只是為了要精進我的中文。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First I would like to ask the accuser, how long have you been married to your husband? Do you have kids?

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that they themselves are from Taiwan.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Then, over the past few years, does he keep teaching Portuguese as a job in Taiwan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he’s a Portuguese teacher. After we were married, he still kept teaching Portuguese.However, Portuguese is not a popular language for Taiwanese to learn. So, his teaching hours were always unstable. There would even be a one or two-month periods between jobs. Therefore, in order to get a more steady income, he decided to teach English.However, English is not his mother tongue. So, he went to seek an advance degree.

You mentioned that he decided to seek an advance degree. Do you mean earning a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the meaning of '進修' as 'seeking an advance degree' instead of 'taking further studies'

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, the degree he has to acquire is TESOL.He went online and found a distance learning program from California, United States. So, he got to stay at home and did the distance learning instead of going abroad.This way, he can earn enough credits to get a master’s degree so that he can get a job of English teaching in Taiwan with this degree from the States.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Well, what’s the relationship between him and the person he’s having an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues from the cram school. The cram school will arrange a Chinese teacher to partner with an English teacher. That woman is his partner in the cram school.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you find out their affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'their' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'their' and 'affair' in the translation.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I only suspected of working late in the cram school too often. I asked him, “It’s just an English cram school, what’s there to stay late for?” He told me that because of partnering, he had to communicate a lot with his partner.At first, I didn’t really suspect him of having an affair. However, when he got back home from work, he would always get some calls. And he would not answer the calls in front of me. He would even go to the study room to answer the phone. So, I checked his phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything unusual in the phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, the same number always appeared. So, I went to check his text messages. After I checked, I found out that he’s been texting with the same person every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was curious about the content of the text messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Well, it’s just texting. Are the texts juicy?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'juicy' as '恰當' which does not convey the same meaning.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it’s just regular texting, it’s fine. However, he is a married man. Why would somebody texting some intimate messages. I submitted some of the messages before, so they should be in the investigatory files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '在卷夾裡面了' as 'in the investigatory files' instead of 'in the case file'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the critical context of the messages being submitted to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Show exhibit number one. Check the page thirteen. Defendant, are these the text messages in your phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些是我手機裡的訊息。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I’m going to ask you some questions regarding these messages.The first one was sent at 9:50 PM, December 21st 2017. The number is 0958932123. The text messages said, “我非常想你。” What does it mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
呃嗯…是一個同事發給我的。我記得我那時請假了兩天，所以他可能有點擔心我吧，所以才發了這封訊息。我的同事是在美國接受教育的，所以他的思想非常開放，他說話就是那個樣子，至於為什麼會說「我的愛」，這是因為這是我們稱呼我們在乎的人的方式。

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that because this colleague is educated in the U.S., her thoughts are pretty westernized. So, “my love” does not mean anything, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its cultural connotations.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對的，「我的愛」只是用來稱呼那些很好的朋友或是在乎的人，沒什麼特別的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '我的愛' is not simply used to refer to good friends or people who care for each other, but rather carries a deeper connotation of affection or endearment.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the phrase before that?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，他只是擔心我而已。我們是工作上的共事夥伴，因此我請了兩天假，他自然而然會想念我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
What your saying is that just because you took two days off, she missed you without your help at work, she texted you “I miss you.” Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對的，訊息就只是這樣而已，並沒有什麼大不了的。

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, let’s move on to the next message. Text message number 2 was sent at 11:55 PM, December 29th 2017. It was sent by the same person. The message says “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” So, what does this message mean?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他之所以傳給我這封簡訊是為了教我如何用中文表達。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You’re saying that the reason that this person texted you this message is to help you with your homework. What does that even mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我老婆剛剛有提到的，我正在就讀一個碩士學程。我必須要拿到三十學分，所以自然而然的有一些功課跟練習需要操作。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you please first explain what you’re studying in your master’s degree?

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學程主要為英語教學。在這學程裡當然要學英語教學能力，還有一些文化溝通課程和語文能力的學程。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the specific courses mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation does not mention that some courses were related to culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
You’re trying to earn a master’s degree in TESOL. But there are some cultural communication courses in it, is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少有三個課程是跟文化溝通有官。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'related' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '有' (have) before the phrase '文化溝通' (culture and communication), resulting in incorrect word order.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So, what are the assignments for this so-called cultural communication courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing question mark

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通的課程對於每個學生來說都不太一樣。以我來說的話，因為我想在台灣找一個教職工作，所以我必須展現我的教學能力及中文上的溝通能力進以達成我的目標。所以，我很多的作業是中英文章的翻譯。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Because you have to prove that you have the competence to teach in Taiwan, you have to learn Chinese. And a lot of the assignments are about translation. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific requirement of the master's course.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'learn' before the object 'Chinese', resulting in incorrect word order.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，而當然我也被要求須要加強我的口說、寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s get back to the text message. You said that’s your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對的，我還記得那條訊息。你也知道的，有些中文字，對於外國人來說，是很難理解的，所以當我接到這個作業後，我就傳訊息給我那位同事，要他傳答案給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You typed in Chinese and ask your colleague to type in English and text back to you. This text message is just a product of an assignment, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text, specifically the part about asking the colleague for the answer.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'You typed in Chinese and asked your colleague to type in English and text back to you.'

That message was only the answer to my homework.
是的，那封簡訊只是我作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Okay. Let’s show the investigatory records again. From page 14 to page 16, look at all the text messages. Are these all your assignments?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對的，這些訊息的目的都只是為了完成我的作業而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the messages being referred to.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation on your wife accusing you of having an affair with your colleague?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
在這件事上，我覺得我太太只是想太多了。我知道我可能無法滿足他對於這個家庭的期望，但在我開始這學位的時候，我太太並沒有展現他的任何支持。他一點都不願意幫助我來完成我的學程，如果他一開始多支持我一點的話，我也根本就不用去問我的搭檔了。所以我覺得，對於這整場誤會，他最該怪的是他自己。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by changing the meaning of the sentence. The original text states that the wife thinks too much of the matter, while the user's translation suggests that the husband thinks his wife is overthinking.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in several sentences, resulting in a confusing and unnatural sentence structure.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the husband asking his colleague for help, which is an important detail in the original text.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
Based on your testimonies, there’s something unhappy going on between you and your wife, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們婚姻剛開始的時候的確是蠻快樂的。但後來主要的問題就是我的工作，因為在台灣，教葡萄牙語實在無法獲得穩定的薪水跟工作時間。所以我們就越來越疏遠了，我沒辦法讓他明白我的挫折感，我也不知道要怎麼與他溝通。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay. Let’s get back to your master degree. When does your master degree start? Does it end? Did you get your degree?

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect tense
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing question mark
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'start' instead of 'begin'

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年的秋天開始這個課程的，這是一個兩年的課程，所以我理應該可以在2017年的五月拿到這個學位。但是，我後來並沒有完成，因為我還有兼職的工作，所以我沒有時間做完所有的作業。就像我說的，我太太從一開始就不支持我。所以，我就像是獨自一人在進攻這個學位，到了後來我已經太累，也充滿了挫折感。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
This course is a two-year course, but you did not finish. Why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我無法完成所有的課程作業。也無法完成一些課程的需求。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out 'and also the course requirement'

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When is the last semester of your registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊在學的最後一個學期是2017年的春天。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added unnecessary information

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, your registration should end on May 2017. So, why are you still texting your colleague long after seven months of the end of your registration? There should be no assignments left, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
呃，就算我沒有通過這個學程，我還是想要繼續學中文呀。所以我還是繼續自己跟同事傳簡訊來學習、增強我的中文能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
What you’re is that even though you did not finish the master’s degree program, you still want to keep on learning Chinese in order to be more fluent on Chinese, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect word choice

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
沒錯，所以我才尋求我同事的幫助。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
The role your colleague is serving is kind of like your tutor, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只像是我的家教，也是一個真正的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject 'you' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
並沒有，我曾有提過要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾有提過要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why would she, in the middle of the night, way past sleeping hours, still text to help you? Isn’t this relationship beyond co-worker’s relationships?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說，他是一個很支持我的朋友。他犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學中文！
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '她是一個很支持我的朋友' instead of '他是一個很支持我的朋友'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of learning Chinese in the translation.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still working in that cram school to teach English?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'working' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'still' in the wrong position in the sentence.

Yes, I am still working there.
對的，我仍在那裏工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does this colleague still work at that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'cram school' in the translation.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
對的，他也仍在這間補習班工作，但我們不再是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們不再是搭檔了' instead of '但不再是搭檔了我們'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have anyone that you need to summon further to examine?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to summon this colleague from Mei Err Mei Cram School, Ron Err Huang, so that she can state this case as a witness and explain those text messages and the background reasons of sending those messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you need this court to summon anyone to investigate further on?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of any specific evidence or information that the accuser wants the court to investigate.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school did take some actions on the relationships between those two. And they even asked that woman to quit this job. So I was wondering that if we can confirm this matter from the cram school.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any other further evidences that you want this court to investigate for you?The situation now is that your master degree program already ended on May 2017. You really don’t have the rightful reasons to send these messages and you cannot use assignments as an excuse to justify your relationship with your colleague. It really is suspicious. Do you have any evidences that can help you with this case?

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我並沒有任何需要庭上幫我調查的證據。就像我之前說的，我跟我同事的關係非常簡單，我只是想增強我的中文能力而已。

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next procedure of this case is set at 4:30 PM, on June 24th 2018. We will move on the cross-examination process. Both parties have the right to a lawyer. Do both parties understand? And the accuser and the defendant have to be here.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s prosedure, the court will going the court is going to ask the defendant about the the the relationship between him and his coworker to clarify if the adultery is true. Do both parties understand today’s procedure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	repetition of words and incorrect word order

我明白
I understand.

I understand.
了解。

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long have you married with your husband? Do you have an do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'have you married'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'accuser' is not an appropriate translation for '告訴人'. It should be 'complainant' or 'plaintiff'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'accuser' implies a negative connotation of accusing someone of wrongdoing, which may not be the intended meaning in this context.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years and we do not have children.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Are you married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other four years ago. At that time, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker being the one who met the husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase 'four years ago' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'met'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '想要' as 'to teach' instead of 'wanted to'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past years, is his job to teach Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When I just married when we just married, he was a Portuguese teacher  and he kept teaching Portguese after we married. However, the however Portuguese is not a dominant language in Taiwan, so my husband teaching hour is not certainty. Thus, it’s always period between jobs. So, in order to make a fixed salary, he wants to teach English, but English is not his major language, so he wants to seek an advanced agree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mention seek an avanced agree. Does it means that getting a degree in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the mention of studying in Taiwan for a degree.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he wanted to teach English,  so the degree he got need to be related to English teaching. He found a distance learnig program provided by California in USA so that he can complete the course the requirements through online learning. After he complete the course required, he will got he will get a bachelor degree he will get a US bachelor degree which can help him teach English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'After he complete the course required, he will got he will get a US bachelor degree which can help him teach English in Taiwan.' The correct word order should be 'After he completes the required course, he will get a US bachelor's degree, which can help him teach English in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about the specific degree the person needs to obtain in order to teach English in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user left out the information about the person's plan to find a teaching job in Taiwan after obtaining the degree.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So, what is the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in a cram school. The cram school provided the course taught by foreign teacher and Taiwanese teacher. So, the woman is the Chinese teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'know' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At the beginning, I just think that that why did he always work overtime in the cram school. He said because of the because he needs to partner with the Chinese teacher, so he will need to have some communication with his partner, but I still think that it’s just a cram school, why do you still need to work overtime? At the beginning, I don’t doubt him. But, afterwards, he always getting his phone calls in the study room. In other words, he tried to avoid making me see her him talking with others, so I checked the phone books so I checked his phone.

grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So, what do you found in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
After check his phone books, I find there is a phone number which he always called. Furthermore, I went to check his text message and I found he always has text messages with a woman.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is communicating with the same phone number frequently.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the user is curious about the content of the text messages.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence that mentions the person in question communicating with a woman almost every day.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the information that they checked the person's phone books.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Text message seems to be a not seriors problem. Is the content of the text message not appropriate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
But it is not ordinary messages. My husband is a married man. Why did allow a woman to send him some intimate messages. I have provided those messages to the court. I think they are now in the files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the husband received intimate messages, while the user's translation states that the husband allowed a woman to send him intimate messages.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation omits the critical context of the user providing the messages to the court. This context is important for understanding the situation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Exibit 1 in page thirty one in page thirteen. The defendant, please check if these messages is from your cell phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這就是我手機上的簡訊。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I need to now I want to ask you some questions about the message. First, that text message is sent at twenty first fifty, on twenty first in December in 2017. The phone number is 2958 0958932123. The content of the message is that I miss you so much. What’s that means what does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I really miss you, my love' as 'I miss you so much' which changes the intensity of the feeling expressed.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封簡訊是來自於我的同事。那一次我請了兩天假，所以她覺得非常擔心，才寄了這樣的一封簡訊給我。我這位同事是在美國受教育的，所以她的所以她表達方式比較開放，這就是他們表達愛的一種方式。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
minor categories of cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	not translating the term 'my love'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So, do you mean that your colleague is educated in US, so her so her expression is more open. The expression my love is not special, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by suggesting that the sender's expression of '我的愛' (my love) is not special, whereas the original text does not mention anything about the expression being ordinary or not special.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對，這不是一個太奇怪的方式。這就是朋友之間的表達方式。這就是好朋友之間或非常在乎對方的人之間的表達方式。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation does not capture this meaning.

那她前面那句呢？
So, what about the the last sentence?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，我同事只是很擔心我，因為我請假了兩天。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker and the colleague are partners at work.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'naturally missed me' as 'just worried about me' which changes the meaning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '因為我請假了兩天' (because I took two days off) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '很擔心我' (worried about me).

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So, do you mean that the text message so do you mean that the message texted by her is just because that you leave away for two days and she missed you for accompanying you to teaching?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text suggests that the person missed the user's assistance in teaching, not the user themselves.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order, resulting in a confusing sentence structure.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，這就是我想表達的。我認為那封簡訊真的不是個大問題。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the message being a text message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Exibit 2, the text message is sent at twenty third fifty five, on twenty ninth in December in 2017. The phone number is the same as the above. The content is that I want to by my side I want to by your side, and what can we truly be together?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I want to by my side'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I want to by your side'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect translation of 'when can we be truly together?' as 'and what can we truly be together?'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這封簡訊是想問我這些英文句子在中文裡面應該怎麼表達。 這只是個工作。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她寫這封簡訊是想告訴我如何在我的作業中表達一個中文句子。'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '問' (ask) in the translation is incorrect. The correct word should be '告訴' (tell).

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You are mean that so do you mean that she roll this message to help you compete your assignment? What does that means?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Misinterpretation of the meaning of the original text

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太說的，我正在爭取一個碩士學位而且我必須要完成30學分。所以很正常所以很正常地，我必須會有一些工作我必須會有一些作業要做。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'assignments and exercises' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed '很正常地' (naturally) in the wrong position in the sentence.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Uh so please explain that what do you actually study to achieve your master degree.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'actually' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'actually' at the end of the sentence instead of at the beginning.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是英語教學，這裡面一部分包含了英語教學， 另一部分包含語言能力及文化。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of the program being TESOL.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '我的課程' (my program) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb '是' (was).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'TESOL' as '英語教學' (English teaching) instead of '教育碩士學位英語教學法' (Master's degree in English teaching).

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So, you mean that you will get a degree of TESOL, but the course also includes some culture communication?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'degree' in the translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the word 'TESOL' which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	The user added the phrase 'but the course also includes some culture communication' which is not present in the original text.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，如果沒記錯的話，有三門課是跟文化溝通有關係的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'courses' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '如果沒記錯的話' (if I remember correctly) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '課' (class) instead of '門課' (courses), which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what does the assignment which is related to this kind of course?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'related' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'which' in the wrong position in the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這樣的文化或是溝通的課程是將會因人而異。拿我自己當例子好了，我想要得到英語教學的學位，所以我必須要證明自己對於中文有一定的了解。所以我的作業當中有很多是關於中英對譯。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean that you wanted to getting a teaching position in Taiwan, so the course require you to have the understanding of Chinese, so many assignments related to your course is translation between Chinese and English. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'getting' instead of 'getting into'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misinterpreting the purpose of the course

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的沒錯。此外我還被要求要精進我的口說跟寫作寫作能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '要求' (required) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '精進' (sharpen) before the object '我的口說跟寫作能力' (my speaking and writing skills), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, let’s get back to the point. The message we just mentioned is your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，當我收到作業上的那兩那幾句中文時，我不知道要如何翻譯他們，法官也知道的，中文字有的時候對於外國人來說難以辨識，所所以我就向我的同事求助並請她將答案寄給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So, the situation is that you ask the your colleague the translation of the Chinese sentence and ask her to send the answer to you through text message, so the message is just a part of your assignment.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text, specifically the content of the Chinese sentence and the fact that it was sent as a text message.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order should be 'So, the situation is that you asked your colleague for the translation of the Chinese sentence and asked her to send the answer to you through a text message.'

That message was only the answer to my homework.
是的，那封簡訊就只是我作業的一部分而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'answer' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
The defendant, please see the evidence show on Page No.14 to page 16. These message are all for your assignments, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages on pages 14 to 16.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'defendant' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'see'.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些所有這所有的簡訊都是為了完成作業而存在的。

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, regard so concerning that your wife think that you have an affair with your colleague, what’s your explanation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation marks
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the word 'to' before 'your wife'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	used 'regard so concerning' instead of 'so, regarding'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	translated 'think' as 'regard'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	did not translate '外遇' (affair)

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
關於這件事，我覺得我的太太真的想得太多了。我知道她對於我沒有對這個家提供我知道她一直在意我沒有對這個家提供資助，但我想讓法官知道的是，從我開始這段課程，我的太太也沒有提供我任何支持。因為在我想要取得學位這件事上，我太太的我太太的態度一直不是那麼的支持，如果她可以表示出支持的話，我就不需要去找我的同事尋求協助了阿!所以我覺得她應該為這整件誤解負一些責任。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
So, it seems that you are not satisfied with your relationships?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們的婚姻一開始，我們也曾經過得很幸福。但是一切的問題都來自於我的工作，我無法在教授葡萄牙語上得到穩定的授課時數。這件事，關於我的工作這件事，是造成我們不愉快的最大原因，而我們也已經因為這件事起了很多衝突，我的太太不相信我已經在工作這件事上做了最大的努力，我不知道如何讓他了解我的挫折和我面對的處境。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Uh, back to your master degree, when did the course begin and do you complete your course and get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So, you say that the whole program last for two years and you don’t complete the course and get the degree, why?

我沒有辦法完成所有的作業一些還有一些課程的要求。

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
What is the end of your registered period?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後一學期是在2017年的春天。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '在' before '2017年'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing period at the end of the sentence

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you mentioned above, your course may your course is supposed to was supposed to end in May in 2017, so you are supposed to not have the assignment at all, but you still have text message with your colleague after seven month of your expiration.

omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	inserting content not present in the original text

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然我最後沒有取得學位，但這不代表我就放棄精進我的中文了，所以在課程結束後，我仍持續地靠自學進修我的中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even though you didn’t complete your degree, you still want to keep improving your Chinese competence. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是為什麼我持續尋求我同事的協助。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'continuously' from the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, the role of your colleague is like a personal teacher?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'personal teacher' instead of 'tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
對我而言，她不只是個家教，而是我真正的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
So, do you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, 'you'.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有耶，不過我曾經有說過要付她報酬，但她婉拒了我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'No' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '沒有耶' (No) at the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '曾經有說過' (once said) instead of 'offered' to translate 'offered to pay'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '但她婉拒了我' (but she declined me) at the wrong position in the sentence.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
So, if you didn’t pay her, why does your colleague sending you answer in the midnight, which is a sleeping time of her? I think the situation is beyond the coworker’s relationship.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我說她是我真正的好朋友啊!在我學習中文這件事情，她一直表示著為最大的支持。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是我真正的好朋友' instead of '我說她是我真正的好朋友'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '表示著為最大的支持' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'using her own time to help me learn Chinese'. A more appropriate translation would be '用她自己的時間幫助我學習中文'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那裡工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
So that colleague so is that colleague still work there still working there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，她也還在那裡工作，但我們不再是彼此的搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們不再是彼此的搭檔了' instead of '但我們不再是搭檔彼此了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any person that you want to subpoena or any evidence that need the court to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena the defendant’s colleague Huang Ron-Er to serve as a witness. I hope that she can explain her relation with the defendant.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the details about the text messages and their background and purpose.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The defendant, do you have any evidence that need the court to investigate for you
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the 'plaintiff' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'defendant' at the beginning of the sentence instead of the object 'plaintiff'.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I hope that the court can subpoena the cram school 美而美. Uh, I hope that the court will inquire the cram school 美而美 about the whole situation. I heard that the cram school once took some actions to deal with this situation and they even wanted to persuade the woman to leave.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	incorporating superfluous words or phrases
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence that need the court to help you with your case? The current situation is that your master degree course ended in May in 2017, so that’s not an explanation that can help you clarify your relationship between you and Huang Ron-Er. So, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate?

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong translation of '希望'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong translation of '事證'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong translation of '解釋'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我實在是沒有任何證據可以代表我，就像我說的，我們之間的關係很簡單，就只是我想要持續進修英文，而我的同事提供我協助，就這樣而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of improving language ability and learning Chinese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb phrase '持續進修英文' (continuing to learn English) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect in Chinese word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '持續進修英文' (continuing to learn English) as '進修英文' (learning English), which changes the meaning.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the procedure of inquiry of the witness is set to be at four thirty PM on twenty forth in June in 2018. Both of the parties need to attend the procedure attend the court. Both of you can hire a lawyer.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the Republic of China (中華民國) and the year (107年) in the translation.

Same as the indictment

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
We’ re here today for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The accuser filed the case because her husband had an affair with his coworker, and it’s beyond co-workers’ relationship. The accuser found some intimate messages in her husband phone. Her husband often made up reasons for extra hours working, also he would found up reason for doing tele-conferencing with his co-worker Rong-Er Huang. The defendant, your wife accused you had an adultery case, what’s your plea?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the accuser's name, Wang Yuhan.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the accuser is the one who filed the case.

omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention that the communication between the defendant and his coworker went beyond a normal working relationship.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the defendant's wife is accusing him of the crime of adultery.

Not guilty, of course.
我無罪
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'Not guilty' as '我無罪', which means 'I am not guilty' instead of '無罪', which means 'not guilty'.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, we will ask the details of text messages of the defendant to confirm if the adultery case existed. Does both parties understand the procedure?

我明白

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long have you been married to your husband? Do you have a child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband, the accuser?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for 4 years, and we don’t have kids.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Did you marry in Taiwan, or in other country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband 4 years ago. He first came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that they met in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '4 years ago' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'met'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '想要' as 'for teaching' instead of 'wanting to'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Well, over the past few years, his job in Taiwan is just teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense to match the time frame mentioned in the original text.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he still teaches Portuguese. However, there aren’t many people in Taiwan want to learn Portuguese so his teaching hours is not stable. Sometimes, there is a period between jobs, even for two months. In order to increase the income he decided to teach English. However, his native language is not English so he decided to seek an advance degree in English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he decided to seek an advance degree. Does it mean that he wanted to seek a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in their translation.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wanted to teach English, he wanted to get a degree of TESOL. He found a online platform about distance learning program provided by California, so he doesn’t have to go to America to get that degree. After finish all the classes, he can get a master degree. Then, he can get a English teaching job in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what’s the relationship between him and the person he has adultery?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
There are coworkers in the cram school. In that cram school, they have foreign teachers and Chinese teachers. They partner up to teach the classes, so the lady is his partner.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'know' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At the beginning, I found that he often worked over hours at the cram school. I asked him why he had to spend so much time at the cram school. It’s not necessary. He said that because he had to partner up with Taiwanese teacher. He had to communicate with her. At first, I didn’t doubt that he has an affair. However, sometimes after he came home, he often had a phone call. He didn’t answer the phone in front of me. Instead, he went to the study room to answer the phone. After I checked his phone, I found that there are some messages.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything unusual in his phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'his' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'find'.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
First, I found that there is always a same number in his phone record. Then, I checked his messages. I found that he kept texting with the same lady, and they have messages everyday.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even if they are messaging, that’s not a big deal. Is the context inappropriate?
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation omits the critical context of the message being sent via text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it just a normal message, why did she kept texting to the man who is married. I found some intimate messages. It should be in the file that I provided to the court before.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '讓對方發一些很親密的字句' as 'kept texting intimate messages' instead of 'letting the other party send some intimate words'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court, which is important context for understanding the situation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
As you can see in the file, there are some messages in the file. I want to ask the defendant. Is that the messages in your cellphone?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的這是我手機裡的訊息
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '是的' (yes) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb '是' (to be).

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then, I want to ask some questions about these messages.The first message is sent from the phone number 0958932123, at 9:50 pm, on Dec 21st, 2017. The message is : “ I really miss you, my love.” What does that mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I really miss you, my love' is accurate, but the word choice for 'miss' is incorrect. It should be translated as '想念' instead of '錯過'.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封簡訊是我同事傳的，那時我請假兩天，所以她只是傳簡訊來關心我一下。我的同事是在美國受教育的。他的思想非常開放，至於my love 這個字只是用來表達我們在乎的人而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'bit concerned or worried' as '只是傳簡訊來關心我一下' does not accurately convey the level of concern or worry expressed in the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'very open-minded' as '思想非常開放' does not capture the same level of openness and tolerance conveyed in the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'my love' as '在乎的人' does not accurately convey the affectionate and endearing nature of the term in the original text.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So the person is educated in the U.S. Her mind is westernized, and she openly expresses her emotion, so the word “my love” is not a big deal. Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the meaning of the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
是的，那個只是我們彼此之間稱呼在乎的朋友的方式
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation does not capture this meaning.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the former part of the message?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the translation of the former part of the message.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
正如我所說的，他只是很擔心我而已，在我請假兩天時，他非常的擔心，畢竟我們是工作上的搭擋。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So did you mean that because you were away for two days, and without your assistance, she just missed you, so she sent the message to worry about you?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，那封簡訊真的沒有什麼
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Then, the second message also sent from the same number, at 11:55 pm, Dec 29th, 2017. The content is “ I want you by my side, when can we be truly together? What does it mean?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他寫那個句子是為了幫助我寫中文作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You meant that the purpose that the message to help you to do the homework. What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
正如我太太先前提過的，我為了要拿到我的學位，我必須完成30學分的課程，還有一些作業及習題。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of attending a Master's program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you please explain what is your master degree about?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'first' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user inverted the word order in the translation.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程主要是英語教學，那個課程涵蓋英語教學，以及文化和語言能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you get a degree of TESOL, and there are some culture and communication courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'some' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'degree' before the phrase 'of TESOL', which is incorrect word order.
cultural transformation	misunderstanding historical or social context	The user did not accurately translate the phrase '文化溝通' as 'culture and communication', which is a key concept in the original text.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的我記得有三門課程是與語言文化有關
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of the courses being related to culture and communication.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What are the assignments of the course Culture and Communication?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing question mark

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
在這門課的作業是因人而異的。以我來說，我為了要在台灣取得英語教學工作，我必須要有能力用當地語言溝通。所以我很多作業都是中英翻譯。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '很多' (many)

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
In order to get the English teaching degree, you have to finish some assignments about Chinese-English translation. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific requirement of proving a certain level of Chinese proficiency in order to teach English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order in the sentence 'English teaching degree' to 'teaching English degree'.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，我還需要精進我的口說與寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Then….Let’s go back to the sentence we just said. Is that your assignment
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，那是我的作業，當時我看到這個句子我不知道該怎麼翻譯。你也知道，中文字對外國人來說是很困難的，所以我就問我的同事，並請她傳訊息告訴我答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you meant… because you asked some questions about Chinese, your colleague sent you this message. This is just about the assignment. Is that what you meant?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the meaning of the original text
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the cultural context

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Please see the evidence 1, page 14-16. These messages are all your assignment. The person sent you the messages because you need help for your assignments. Is that right?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation about your wife accused you had an affair with your coworker?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事情真的是想太多了，我知道她很不滿我沒有那麼多能力去支撐整個家庭，但當時我要去進修的時候她完全沒任何支持。因為他一開始就沒有支持我。如果她當時支持我的話，我就不會去找我同事幫忙，她應該怪罪於自己。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your words, it seems that you didn’t get along with your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們剛結婚時，的確相處得非常愉快。主要是我工作的問題，因為教授葡萄牙文的時數並不是很固定。所以這就變成我們之間很大的問題，我們常常為這件事吵架，她並不相信我已經盡力，她並不知道我因這件事非常挫折。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So let’s go back to your master degree. When did you start it? Does it finish? Did you get your degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question word 'What' before 'master degree'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'Does it finish?' instead of 'Did it finish?' to match the past tense of the question.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年秋季註冊的，那是兩年的課程，我應該會在2017年的五月完成，但我一直有兼職工作，我沒有時間做作業，所以我沒有完成它。就像我所說的，我的太太並沒有支持我，讓我覺得很孤獨、很累，所以我就沒有拿到學位。
omission or addition	omission of details	missing the mention of feeling tired and frustrated
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence '我就沒有拿到學位'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using '拿到' instead of '取得' to translate 'pursuing the degree'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You meant that this program is for two years, and you didn’t finish in the end. Why is that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我無法完成所有課程的作業。以及一些課程的要求
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out 'and also the course requirement'

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When is the last semester you registered?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後註冊的學期是2017年的春學期。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '的學期' (the semester)

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you mentioned, your program should be finished on 2017 in May. But the messages happened 7 months after the program finished. Why was that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我完成我的學位，這並不代表我不想精進我的語言能力。所以就算我沒有完成我得學位我還是有在自學，精進我的語言能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就算我沒有完成我的學位，這並不代表我不想精進我的語言能力。'
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '所以就算我沒有完成我得學位我還是有在自學，精進我的語言能力。' which is not present in the original text.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You meant that even you didn’t finish your program. You still want to learn Chinese to improve your Chinese ability. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the master's degree program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'program' before 'finish', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫忙
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague is just like your tutor. Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'role model'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是我的家教，還是我的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject 'you' in the translation.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
不，我曾提出要付她錢，但她拒絕。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾提出要付她錢，但她拒絕。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why would she help you in the midnight? Is that beyond what the coworker has to do?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我會說他是非常支持我的朋友，她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我會說她是非常支持我的朋友'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' (he) is used instead of '她' (she) in the translation.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The phrase '她用自己的時間來' (she used her own time to) is added in the translation, which is not present in the original text.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific subject of teaching, which is English.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的我還在那工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does this colleague still work there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，她還在那工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們已經不是搭擋了' instead of '但我們已經不是搭擋了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any evidence that you want to investigate? Do you want to subpoena someone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, Ron Er Huang. I want her to come to the court to explain the relationship between her and the defendant and explain the content of the messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'accuser' and 'court' in the translation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that MeiErMei cram school had tried to deal with their relationship. They even asked their colleague Ron Er Huang to quit the job. I would like to subpoena the officer of the cram school to the court.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about the actions taken by MeiErMei cram school.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the context of why the cram school asked Ron Er Huang to quit the job.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the intention to subpoena the officer of the cram school to the court, which was not mentioned in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'to the court' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'subpoena'.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? According to your words, your program should be finished on May 2017. You have no excuse for that, especially the messages were often sent after 9 pm. Do you have any evidence that you can prove that is just for the assignment?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect word choice

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我目前有任何想要法院幫忙調查的證據。就像我所說的，我與同事之間的關係非常簡單，我只是想要提升我的中文能力而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court date will be set on 2018, June 24th, at 4:30 pm. The court will ask some questions to the witnesses. The both parties please make sure to come to the court. If necessary, you can hire a lawyer. Does the both parties understand ?

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of an adultery case. The accuser Wang Yuhan, she thinks her husband is having an intimate relationship with his co-worker in the company. The accuser found intimate messages in the phone of his husband and his husband always found excuses for working late in the night. And he always has tele-conferencing with his coworker in the night. This situation, she thinks, has beyond coworker’s relationship, therefore she decided to file an adultery case. Defendant, your wife thinks you’ve committed the case of adultery, what’s your plea?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the specific accusation of the accuser, which is that her husband is having an affair with his co-worker.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user fails to mention that the accuser found intimate messages in her husband's phone, which is a crucial piece of evidence in the case.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skips the sentence about the husband always finding excuses for working late at night, which is another important detail in the case.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user adds the phrase 'This situation, she thinks, has beyond coworker’s relationship,' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is awkward and does not follow proper English word order.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user uses the incorrect verb form 'thinks' instead of 'think' to match the plural subject 'wives'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The user uses the pronoun 'his' instead of 'her' to refer to the accuser's husband.
grammar and structure	preposition errors	The user uses the incorrect preposition 'in' instead of 'with' when describing the husband's relationship with his co-worker.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user does not use proper punctuation, such as commas, to separate clauses and phrases.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user uses the phrase 'file an adultery case' instead of 'file an adultery charge' or 'file for divorce on grounds of adultery.'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, this court will ask the details of the relationship of the defendant and the coworker to decide whether they have committed adultery. Do you fully understand?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

我明白
I understand.

I understand.
我了解。

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve been married for four years, and we do not have kids.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
So do you get married with your husband in Taiwan or in any other countries?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'you' before 'get married'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the prepositional phrase 'with your husband' before the verb 'get married', which is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that they themselves are also from Taiwan.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in past years, is your husband’s main job about teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, he continued as a Portuguese teacher. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so my husband always had an unstable condition in teaching Portuguese, for example, he would have few weeks not teaching Portuguese. Therefore, to make his income stable, however, English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced education.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that your husband decided to seek an advanced program in Taiwan, do you mean he wants a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '念一個學位' as 'wants a degree' instead of 'study for a degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wants to take English-teaching as his job, therefore he must have a TESOL certificate. He found online a distance learning program in California, therefore he didn’t have to go to the US. And he can sit at home and receive distance learning and meet the requirements of the program. After he finished all the credits, he would have a postgraduate degree. Therefore, with such a certificate, he can have a job as an English teacher.

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So What’s the relationship between he and the partner he is having a relationship with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
The person he is having a relationship with is a co-worker in his class. The teaching school has one Chinese teacher and one foreign teacher for one class. And the woman is the Chinese teacher in his class.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original text by using 'relationship' instead of 'colleague'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the information about the teaching arrangement in the language school.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they are having an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'they' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation does not have subject-verb agreement. 'They' should be followed by 'are' instead of 'is'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, he always worked overtime and didn’t come home. I’m confused that it’s only a teaching school. There’s no reason for him to work overtime. He explains that he had to work with a Chinese teacher, and there’s much to communicate with that Chinese teacher. At first, he didn’t think he is having an affair. But later on, I found he constantly received telephone calls at home. And he didn’t receive those phone calls in front of me. Instead, he goes to the study room to receive those phone calls. So I got a little curious about the intention of him and later I checked his cellphone and found the reason.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, I found one telephone number constantly showing in his phone book. And therefore, I checked his messages and found that he sent text messages to that number constantly.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is communicating with a woman.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the context that the person in question is communicating with a woman on a daily basis.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
I think it’s ok to send text messages. Is it because the content of the text messages is inappropriate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
They are not sending common text massages. Considering he is a married person, it’s not appropriate to send intimate messages to another woman. I have report to the court the content of the messages. I think they are in the files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的簡訊' as 'common text massages' instead of 'common text messages'.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Exhibit evidence, page 13. Please be noted of the content of the messages. Defendant, please take a look, do you send those messages?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的， 這些是我手機上的訊息。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Therefore, I will ask you a few questions about the text messages. The first message is sent by the phone number 0958-932123 at 9:50 pm, on December 21st, 2017. The content is I really miss you, my love, so what’s your explanation?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
該簡訊的內容由同事傳給我，當時我記得我休假了兩天，她非常擔心，因此發送了這樣的簡訊。我的同事在美國受教育，思想開放，這也是她之所以這樣談話，這樣表達的原因，至於“My love”的部分，這是我們對關心的人的稱呼。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of taking two days off from work.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague being concerned or worried.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague being educated in the US and open-minded.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'my love' being a way to refer to people we care about.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that the sender received her education in the US, and got very westernized and she is very open-minded about stuffs like emotions, and the phrase my love sent by her does not have any special connotations?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the information that the sender received education in the US and got westernized.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation incorrectly states that the sender is open-minded about emotions, which is not mentioned in the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation incorrectly states that the phrase 'my love' does not have any special connotations, which is not mentioned in the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
是的，這樣的話是在朋友間，或是在互相關心的人之間的用法。

那她前面那句呢？
So how about the phrase before my love?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'my love' in the translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
正如我之前所述，她非常擔心我，作為我的同事對於我離開兩天非常擔心。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '作為我的同事，她對我離開兩天非常擔心。'

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So do you mean because you take two days off from work, she got very worried about you and sent you messages like she missed you.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea of the person being worried and expressing missing the other person.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，這就是當時的背景情況，那封簡訊沒有什麼大的問題。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message is sent by the same person at 11:55pm on December 29th, 2017. the content is I really want you be my side, when can we be truly together? So what does this text message mean and what does it exist?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	changing 'I want you by my side' to 'I really want you be my side'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'I really want you be my side'
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	adding 'I really' before 'want you be my side'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她當時寫這封簡訊是告訴我怎麼樣表達我作業中的用法。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that the sender sent you this message to help you with this message, what does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
正如我妻子所向法庭所述，我當時正在修讀一個碩士課程，需要完成30分的學分，因此也需要完成一些作業和考試。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'exercises' in their translation.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Please explain what on earth your master program is about?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'on earth' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士課程是英語教學，內容包括英文教學，文化以及語言能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you mean that there’s something about culture in your English-teaching master program.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少有三門課關於文化與溝通議題。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'related to' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'related to' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'courses'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What’s the homework of these culture and communications courses.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'these' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'homework' at the beginning of the sentence instead of the end.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這樣的一門作業每個人都有所不同，就以我為例，因為我在台灣，希望獲得一個英語教學相關的崗位，要達到這樣的目標，我需要提高自己的英語能力，所以要學好中文。因此我的作業很多方面很多都是中英句子的翻譯。

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean you want to seek an English teaching position in Taiwan, and in this master program you have to prove yourself the Chinese competency. The coursework includes assignments of translating Chinese and English sentences, am I right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of completing assignments as part of the coursework.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the assignments are for practicing translation.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，我同樣被要求提升自己的讀寫能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok, let’s go back to that text massage. Is that your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，因為我當時寫的作業有一些不太理解，因為中文中有些東西外國人很難認， 因此我就請我的同事幫助我來翻譯，然後將答案傳給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by the colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因此我就請我的同事幫助我來翻譯，然後將答案傳給我。'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '當時' to translate 'When', which is not accurate in this context.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user used '外國人很難認' to translate 'difficult for foreigners to recognize', which does not accurately convey the meaning.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you sent the Chinese text message to her and she sent back the Chinese answers to you. Is that your homework?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of asking the colleague for the Chinese translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the order of the subject and verb in the sentence.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
OK, defendant please look at the file One, page 14 to 16. Please carefully check the content of the messages. Are those messages all the assignments of you? Is it because it’s your homework and you sent them to her to help you with your assignment?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant seeking help from the other person for the assignments.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of the defendant seeking help for their homework.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊都是同樣的目的，針對我的作業。

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So what’s your explanation in response to your wife’s suit that you have an affair with the third person?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我的妻子把這件事想得太嚴重了，我知道我持家的能力並不是很好，但她沒在剛開始的時候幫助我啊。因為她一直都沒有幫助我完成我的學位，如果不是這樣，我也不會讓同事幫忙，她應該為此負責，這是誤解的原因。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, it seems that you have some unhappy situations with your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況' as 'you have some unhappy situations with your wife', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛開始相處時，我們彼此都度過了愉快的時光， 但問題就在於我的工作，我剛開始在這裡教葡萄牙語，但並不能獲得穩定的 教學時間。之後工作問題就成了我們之間的問題，我們時而為此吵架，她並不理解我的努力也並不知道我的沮喪和當時的困境。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of fighting over the employment issue.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我們彼此都度過了愉快的時光' (we both had a good time) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '剛開始相處時' (at the beginning of our marriage).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'teaching Portuguese' as '在這裡教葡萄牙語' (teaching Portuguese here) instead of '在台灣教葡萄牙語' (teaching Portuguese in Taiwan).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'my job became the issue between the two of us' as '工作問題就成了我們之間的問題' (the job issue became a problem between us) instead of '我的工作成了我們之間的問題' (my job became a problem between us).
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate 'stable teaching hours'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate 'let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok, let’s go back to the master program, when does this master program start? Does it end? Did you get your diploma?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question about when the master program started and ended.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question about whether the user got their diploma.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這個項目開始於2015年的秋季，應當耗時2年時間，並在2017年5月結束，但是我當時在兼職，我沒有足夠的時間做作業，所以並沒有完成學位。正如我所言，我的妻子在我這個碩士項目上並沒有很幫助我，我覺得我彷彿一個人在追求這個學位，因此非常累也非常沮喪。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean this is a two-year program, and you failed to finish it, what’s the reason?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成所有的課程作業。也沒辦法完成課堂的要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not being able to finish the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So when is the end of the last semester registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
最後註冊的學期是2017年春季。

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, the last semester is May 2017, therefore you shouldn’t have assignment from then on. But the text messages last 7 months after the completion of your master program, what’s your explanation?

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
好吧，儘管我沒有完成自己的碩士項目，但這並不意味著我不能繼續學習中文， 所以結束後，我也是想繼續提升自己的中文能力，所以我繼續一個人努力。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of failing the program.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that although you didn’t complete your master program, you still want to sharpen you Chinese competency, am I right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of meaning

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這也是我讓我同事幫助我的原因。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the role played by your co-worker is like a home teacher, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'home teacher' instead of 'tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
對我來說，她不僅像個家教，更像是個很好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay the tuition to her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我之前說要給她學費，但她拒絕了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of paying for tuition.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the mention of paying for tuition before the offer, which changes the chronological order of events.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, is it beyond coworker’s relationship that she sent text messages to you to answer your questions at midnight?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	changed the meaning of the original text

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
正如我之前所說，她真的在幫助我，利用她的閒餘時間幫我學中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach at that teaching school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of 'English' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'teach' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我仍在那裏工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does your coworker still work there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，她也在那裡教學，但我們並沒有組成一個班。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們並沒有組成一個班，' instead of '但我們並沒有組成一個班。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any evidence you want to investigate or any witness you want to ask to the court?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
This court wants to subpoena the colleague Huang Rong’er, to explain the relationship between these two and the context as well as the purpose of these text massages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of subpoenaing Huang Rong’er as a witness.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' after the noun 'colleague', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'subpoena' instead of 'summon' which is a more appropriate term in this context.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Accuser, is there anything you want the court to further investigate?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard the teaching school has done something about their relationship. They even talked to the coworker to resign. I want to know if it’s right and I want to further investigate this evidence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the teaching school.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'talked' instead of 'tried to convince'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'investigate' instead of 'verify' to convey the meaning of seeking confirmation.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
Defendant, is there any evidence you want us to help investigate for you? Considering your master program has already finished on May 2017, you have no reason to keep sending text messages to your coworker Huang Rong’er for assignment. And the conversations start usually at 9 pm. This is really suspicious. Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有任何的證據作為進一步的調查，我和同事之間的短信互動實際上非常簡單，就是我想提升我的語言能力，精進我的中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next proceeding starts at 4:30 pm on June 24th, 2018. Both the accuser and the defendant shall be present. If required, both parties can have a lawyer, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the date is incorrect.

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.
我了解。

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the reason for the accuser's absence in the court due to illness.

被告Steven Knox於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在其自家門口 （地址為：新北市板橋區長江路 23號6樓），因其摩托車被挪動而與鄰居（即告訴人）發生口角，進而產生肢體衝突。經告訴人至醫院驗傷，醫師診斷為手臂、身體多處挫傷、瘀青，後被提告。檢察官起訴被告違反刑法375條之傷害罪，被告做何答辯？
The incident happened at 7:50 p.m. on July 18th 2020 in the door of the defendant’s house.

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The defendant, at 7:50 p.m. on June 18th 2020 at the door of your house, you had a quarrel with neighborhood, who is also the accuser, and your quarrel came into physical confrontation. In the investigatory record on page 8, there are statements made at the police station. In the statements you made at police station, you said that you went home at 6:30 p.m. at that day. Then you put your motorcycle in the parking slot, and then you went up to the stairs. After you have dinner, you looked down stairs quickly, and you found out there was someone moving your motorcycle. So you go down stairs to check the situation immediately. When you go down the stairs, you found that the one who moved your motorcycle is Damin Chang, the accuser… umm who moved your motorcycle. Then you asked why he move your motorcycle. The accuser said that because your motorcycle stock his way, and you should not stop motorcycle at that place, so he moved your motorcycle. Because you disagree with his statement, so you two have quarrel, right?

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
是的，事情大概就是這樣發生的。我想要強調的是，這不是我們第一次為了停車格的事情而吵架。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
You mean that both parties have many quarrels about the parking slot, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我住在那個社區已經超過8個月了，這幾個月來，告訴人移我的摩托車，而且沒有經過我的同意。他只是不喜歡我把機車放在那個位子，但是他沒有任何理由可以這麼做。在這個社區，每個人都可以把機車停在有空位的地方。

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Then, have you ever reported this kind of case in police station?

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
之前，我都想說要避免衝突，所以有的時候我就會不太在意，或者是假裝沒有看到這類的情形。針對剛剛的問題，我的回答是沒有，我沒有為這件事情報過案，但是其他的鄰居有遇到跟我類似的問題。

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
Are there specific parking slots in your neighborhood?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of motorcycles in their translation.

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
null

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So, in your neighborhood, anyone can stop their motorcycle when there is an empty place?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
是的，只要有空位的話，任何人都可以停在那個空位裡。

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Then, are there any parking slot in the empty area?

是的，市政府有畫至少十格以上的停車格在那個空地。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific information that the designated parking spaces are for motorcycles.

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the motorcycle in the defendant's neighborhood.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
Then, at that day, why did your quarrels become the physical confrontation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我看到有人在移我的摩托車的時候，我立刻從樓上衝到樓下去看發生甚麼事。就像我說的，我不是第一次遇到那樣的情形，所以在那個晚上，我就再也忍不住我的憤怒。當我下樓看的時候，我看到，告訴人已經把他的手放到我的摩托車上，我問他，為甚麼要移我的摩托車，他沒有回答，所以，我就更往前一步站，來阻止他行動。

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
Do you mean that you try to stop the accuser so it became in to the physical confrontation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the accuser wanting to move the motorcycle.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
對，當我推他放在機車把手上的手，他就是不放開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我試著抓住機車把手的時候，他就是不放開。'

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Did you remember who start the physical confrontation first
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得是我把他的手從我的機車上拿開。

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
I’ll show the investigatory record one on page 8, the statement made at the police station. In investigatory record on page 9, line 10, the record showed that you tried to move the accuser’s hand on the motorcycle with much force because he grab your motorcycle tightly.

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the accuser grabbing the motorcycle handle tightly.

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
是的，剛那個就是我在警局裡描述的行動。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
When you move the accuser’s hand, what is his reaction?

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有把手從我機車上移開，更糟糕的是，他把我的機車抓得更緊。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase 'from my motorcycle' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'even more tightly' before 'he grabbed the handlebars' instead of after.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
So the other party did not move his hand from your motorcycle. Instead, he grab your motorcycle more tightly, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes.
是的

接下來發生什麼事呢？
Then, what happened next?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the event that occurred next.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
因為他不把手從我的機車上放開，所以我就推了他的肩膀，希望他可以把手放開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為他不把手從我的機車上放開'.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
So that’s why you push his shoulder?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我有推他肩膀。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我推了他的肩膀' instead of '我有推他肩膀'.

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Did you think that you push him with a strong force?

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，我只是輕輕推他一下，就像是我們平常要提醒別人要做哪些事，或阻止別人做某件事的時候會有的那種輕輕推一下。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
Then, we will show the investigatory record one on page 48. On this page, the medical record in the lein heh hospital. In the medical record, there are many scratches and bruises on accuser’s body and the back of his hand. Why did these injuries happened? Is that the push you did cause?

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there anyone can prove your statement? Is there any witness saw the situation at that day?

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.

Defendant, you had argument with your neighbor and evolved into physical confrontation because he moved your motorbike. The incident happened in front of your house at 7:50 p.m. on June 18, 2020. I’ll show you the statement made at the police station on P.8 in investigation record one. In the statement, you went back home at 6:30 p.m., parked your motorbike, and then went upstairs. After dinner, you looked down and saw someone move your motorbike so you went downstairs to check. When you went downstairs, you found your neighbor also the accuser 張大明was moving your motorbike. You asked him why he moved your motorbike. Then, he replied because your motorbike blocked his car and you couldn’t park here so he moved it.

Have you ever reported to the police …like this before?

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
之前發生口角時，我會想要避免衝突。有時候，我不會在意他移動我的車子。有時候，我會假裝沒看到。回答剛才的問題，我沒有去警局報案過，但其他鄰居也發生過類似的事。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific detail that the neighbor removed the speaker's motorcycle.

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
In your neighborhood, do you all park your motorbikes in fixed spaces?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'certain' or 'specific' spaces for parking motorbikes.

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，我們可以停在任何的空位。也就是，先到的人先停。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about parking being on a first-come-first-serve basis.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So, everyone can park his motorbike of there is empty space, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
沒錯，只要有空位，大家都能停車在那裡。

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Are there any parking slots drawn in the empty space?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'empty' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
沒錯，市政府有畫超過10格停車格。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'designated' which specifies that the parking spaces are specifically designated for motorcycles.

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
I’ll show you the photo on P.24 in investigation record one. In the photo, there are parking slots for motorbikes. Defendant, please make sure.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the photo being in the investigation record.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
沒錯，照片裡面就是我們社區可以停放機車的停車格。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'picture' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '照片' (picture) after the verb '裡面是' (is inside), which is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '停車格' (parking spaces) instead of '停車位' (parking slots), which changes the meaning.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
How did your argument evolve into physical confrontation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我看到有人移動我的摩托車時，我便衝下樓查看。如我剛才所說，這已經不是第一次有人移動我的車。我那時已經忍無可忍。當我下樓時，我看到告訴人將手放在我摩托車的把手上。我問他在做什麼，但他沒有回我任何一句話。…
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation marks
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using '告訴人' instead of '原告'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	translating 'tolerating' as '忍無可忍' instead of '容忍'

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
You mean when the accuser moved your motorbike, you want to stop him soyou have confrontation, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
是的，當我試著握住我的摩托車把手時，他並沒有放手。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'after I put out my hands and' which provides important context.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Do you remember who started first?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我只是想試著把他的手挪開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
I’ll show you the statement made at the police station on P.8 in investigatory record. On P.9 line 10, the accuser grabbed the handlebars tightly and moved your motorbike. So, you… pushed his hands away. …
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the crucial detail that the accuser was forcefully trying to move the motorbike.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the action of pushing the accuser's hands away after mentioning the accuser's action of grabbing the handlebars.

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
是的，這就是我在警局陳述衝突發生的過程。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'statements' in their translation.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
When you pushed his hands away, what was the accuser’s reaction?

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有鬆手。而且他甚至握得更緊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the action of not moving.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '握得更緊' (grabbed more tightly) before the subject '他' (he), which is incorrect.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
You mean the other party didn’t move his hands and even grabbed the handlebars tightly, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes.
沒錯

接下來發生什麼事呢？
What happened next?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the event.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
因為從他的肢體語言來看，他看起來沒有想要鬆手。所以我才推了他的肩膀要他放開把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
Because of this, you pushed his shoulder, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我因為這樣推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Do you think you pushed his shoulder with much force?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，我只是輕輕推了一下，就和其他人會推別人去做或不做一樣。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只是輕輕推了一下'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'like how we generally push others to do or not do something' is not accurately conveyed in the translation.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
I’ll show you the hospitalization on P.48 in investigatory record one. In the hospitalization, there are multiple injuries and bruises on his arms and bodies.How did he suffer? Is it because you pushed his shoulder?

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我不知道為什麼他身上有多處的瘀青和受傷。這不是我造成的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there anyone who can verify your statement and the details of the incident?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific time frame 'that night' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order of the sentence, resulting in an incorrect structure.

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
那時我女朋友正好在家。他知道我下樓，也知道這樣的事已經不是第一次發了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the neighbor and the history between the speaker and the neighbor.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '他' (he) before the verb '知道' (knew), resulting in incorrect word order.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the present tense '知道' (know) instead of the past tense '知道了' (knew) to indicate past events.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
You mean your girlfriend spotted the incident at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
她在我們爭執到一半時下樓，想要拍下當時案發的照片以作為證據。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the cell phone in the translation.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
Specifically speaking, when did your girlfriend do downstairs and try to take a photo about the incident?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
就在我第一次握著把手時，她就下來了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'arriving at the scene' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '她就下來了' (she came down) before '就在我第一次握著把手時' (just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time), resulting in a different meaning.

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she take a photo successfully?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '拍成功' as 'take a photo successfully' instead of 'succeed in filming'.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，當我女朋友要拿手機出來時，告訴人就警告他，但他沒有權力制止她拍照。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning by referring to 'girlfriend' instead of 'plaintiff'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error by using '告訴人' (telling person) instead of '原告' (plaintiff).
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the detail that the plaintiff warned the person not to take out their cell phone.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation leaves out the critical context that the plaintiff had no right to tell the person not to take out their cell phone.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
I have no further questions.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
Today is the preliminary preparatory procedure. Before the next court, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
有，我想要法院調閱在場兩個監視器畫面。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'taken' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '調閱' (to review) before the noun '畫面' (footage), resulting in incorrect word order.

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
You mean there are CCTV cameras at that street and you want the court to check the CCTV clips, right? Can you provide the court with exact time for the segment?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the community in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the mention of the court in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include the question mark at the end of the sentence in the translation.

I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
我大約在晚上7:40下樓，所以我希望法院能調閱晚上7:30到8:10的片段。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'came' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '晚上7:40' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a period at the end of the sentence.

檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
Prosecutor, do you have any opinion about asking for the CCTV clips?

沒有意見。
No.

今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？
The preparatory procedure is dismissed today. The next court will be set at 2:30 p.m. on August 8, 2020. In the next court, we’ll check the CCTV clips and ask both parties some questions about this. Prosecutor and defendant, is there anything to add?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The preparatory procedure is dismissed today' is incorrect. It should be 'Today, the preparatory procedure is dismissed.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the sentence 'The next court will be set at 2:30 p.m. on August 8, 2020' is incorrect. It should be 'The next court is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. on August 8, 2020.'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The phrase 'check the CCTV clips' is not an accurate translation of '庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容'. It should be 'review the surveillance video footage of this case.'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The phrase 'ask both parties some questions about this' is not an accurate translation of '並請雙方陳述意見'. It should be 'ask both parties to present their opinions.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The punctuation in the sentence 'Prosecutor and defendant, is there anything to add?' is incorrect. It should be 'Prosecutor and defendant, is there anything to add?'

沒有。
No, I rest.

No.
我也沒有問題。

那今天開庭到此結束，請在簽完筆錄後離席，謝謝。
The court will be ended here. Please sign the court record and then leave, thank you.

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The accused, you have some argument and therefore have physical confrontation with the accuser at 7:50 p.m. on June 18, 2020. You have confrontation because your motorcycle was moved. In the evidence used in this case, that is, page 8 in Investigatory Record 1, there is a statement made in the police station. According to the statement you made in the police station, you went home at about 6:30 p.m. After you parked your motorcycle, you went upstairs. After you had a dinner, you look out of the window and saw someone at the downstairs was moving your motorcycle, so you went downstairs to check the situation. When you walked downstairs you saw… 大明張, who is the accuser of this case, was moving your motorcycle. Therefore, you asked the accuser why he moved your motorcycle, and the accuser said that your motorcycle had blocked his car. You should not park the motorcycle here, so he moved the motorcycle. Because you didn’t agree the other party’s answer, so you have an argument with the accuser. Is it right?

omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the argument and confrontation were related to the accused's motorcycle being moved.

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
是的，那基本上是當時發生的情況。我想強調這已經不是第一次我們因為停車的關係發生口角。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
Do you mean that the quarrel on the motorcycle parking space between both parties was not happened for the first time?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我住在這個社區已經至少有八個月了，告訴人在沒有原因的情況下…移動我的摩托車已經超過一次了。他只是不喜歡我把摩托車停在那裡，但是他沒有任何理由去做這件事。 在社區，每個人都有權利把車子停在沒有人停的地方。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '告訴人在沒有原因的情況下…移動我的摩托車已經超過一次了' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '告訴人已經超過一次在沒有原因的情況下移動我的摩托車'.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever been to police station to report the incident like such case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
我們之前發生口角的時候，我都會避免發生肢體衝突，有時候我並不介意我的摩托車被移，有時候我會假裝沒有這件事發生。對於告訴人回答，我是從來沒有去和警察報警，其他鄰居也有類似的經驗。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence structure.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing punctuation marks.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect translation of 'confrontation' as '肢體衝突' (physical conflict).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning of 'removal' as '被移' (to be moved) instead of '拿走' (to take away).

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
In your community, does the parking of the motorcycle have the certain space?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，任何人都可以停在沒有人停的空位上，是先到先有的概念。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of parking being allowed in any empty spot.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '任何人' (anyone) before the verb '可以停' (can park), resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'first-come-first-serve basis' as '先到先有的概念' (the concept of first come, first have), which does not accurately convey the intended meaning.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So for the parking of the motorcycle, can everyone park if the space is available?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
是的，只要有空位，任何人都可以去停車。

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Then, does the parking space have some parking slot?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'painted' in the translation.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
沒錯，我們的市政府有畫超過十個位置讓摩托車停放

According to page 24 in Investigatory Record, the picture shows that there are many parking spaces for motorcycle in their community. They have parking slots. Please confirm.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，在這片裡面有我們社區的摩托車停車格。

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
Why did your quarrel at that day become physical confrontation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'after the argument' which provides important context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'at that day' in the wrong position in the sentence.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我從樓上看到有人移動我的摩托車，我就下樓來確認。就像我剛剛說的，已經不只一次有人移動我的摩托車了，我真的不喜歡這樣的事發生。當我下樓時，我看見告訴人的手放在我的摩托車把手上面，我就問他在做什麼，他沒有回我，於是我就向前想要制止他。

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
Do you mean that he was going to move your motorcycle, and you wanted to stop him, so you have physical confrontation with him?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
沒錯，當我出手抓住我摩托車的把手，他也沒有停止抓著我的把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我出手抓住我摩托車的把手' instead of '當我出手抓住我摩托車的把手'.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得我是要把他的手推開。

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
Please refer to page 8 in Investigatory Record about the record from the police. In line 10 on page 9 the accuser used his hand to hold the handlebars. He didn’t release his hands and he wanted to move the motorcycle. The accused tried to pushed his hands away. You said that you tried to push his hands away. Do you mean this action?

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
沒錯，這是在事件發生之後我到警局做的筆錄。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'statements' in the translation.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
What’s the accuser’s reaction when you pushed away his hand

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有移動，他反而是更用力的握著我的摩托車把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
Do you mean that the other party didn’t put away his hands; instead, he grabbed the handlebars…tightly?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the word order in the translation

Yes.
沒錯。

接下來發生什麼事呢？
What happened next?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the event.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
從他的肢體語言來看，他並不想要放手，所以我推了他的肩膀，希望他可以將手放開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
Because of this, you pushed his shoulder. Is it right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我推了他的肩膀' instead of '我推了他的肩膀。'

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
Please refer to page 48 in the Investigatory Record. This is a medical evidence from Lian-He hospital. In the hospital diagnosis, there are multiple scratched and bruises on accuser’s body and his arm. Do you know how this injury happened? Is that because you pushed him?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the accuser's body and only mentioned the arm.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'on accuser's body and his arm' after the mention of the diagnosis, which disrupts the sentence structure.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '挫傷' as 'scratched' instead of 'bruises'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '瘀青' as 'bruises' instead of 'bruises'.

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我不知道這些瘀青跟挫傷是怎麼造成的，那不是我造成的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'injuries' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '造成' (cause) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there anyone who can prove what you said about the situation happened at the night on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
那天晚上我女友在家，他知道我下樓，他也知道我和告訴人之間發生了什麼事。

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
Do you mean that your girlfriend had seen what happened at that day?

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she take the film successfully?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Was she successful in filming?'

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，當我女朋友拿出手機時，告訴人就警告她不要這樣做，但告訴人其實沒有權利這樣制止她。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '告訴人就警告她不要這樣做' instead of '當我女朋友拿出手機時，告訴人就警告她不要這樣做'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'He had no right to tell her that' is not accurately conveyed in the translation. It should be translated as '他沒有權利這樣告訴她' instead of '告訴人其實沒有權利這樣制止她'.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
My question will end here.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The accused, today is the preliminary preparatory procedure. Is there further evidence you want the court to investigate for you before the next court date?

今天告訴人因病向法院請假，因此今天的程序會先跟被告釐清當天的狀況，明白嗎?

被告Steven Knox於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在其自家門口 （地址為：新北市板橋區長江路 23號6樓），因其摩托車被挪動而與鄰居（即告訴人）發生口角，進而產生肢體衝突。經告訴人至醫院驗傷，醫師診斷為手臂、身體多處挫傷、瘀青，後被提告。檢察官起訴被告違反刑法375條之傷害罪，被告做何答辯？
The incident happened at 7:50 pm, on June 18th, 2020. On that day, the defendant was at the door of his house. The contact address is Floor 6, No. 23, Changjiang Road, Banqiao District, New Taipei City. Since the motorcycle of the accused was moved, so he had an argument with his neighbor. Further, they had physical confrontation after that. Afterwards, the accuser went to the hospital and check his injuries, and he was diagnosed that his arm and his body had multiple bruises and injuries, so the defendant is violated…is prosecuted…is suspected of violating the criminal law 375 of attack crime. …?

今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
Today we are here for a preparatory procedure and the court will first show you the evidence. Furthermore, the prosecutor and the defendant can show your stance or your opinion. Today, the defendant didn’t hire a lawyer, so he will make statement himself. Procedurally, do both parties understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我也了解了。

請檢察官提示證據，並發問。

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The defendant at 7:50 pm, on June 18th, 2020, you were at the door of your house and you had a quarrel with your neighbor because of your motorcycle was moved. After that, the situation evolved into physical confrontation. As for the checking and confirmation of the evidence used in this case, we can look at the investigatory record on page 8, there are statements made at the police station. At the police station, and in the statement, you said that around 6:30 pm, you arrived at your house and after you parked your motorcycle, you went upstairs. After you had dinner, and you looked down from the window, you saw that there was a person who was about to move your motorcycle, so you went downstairs and checked the situation. When you went downstairs you encountered the accuser, 張大明, he was removing your motorcycle. So you asked the accuser why do you have to remove my motorbike, and the accuser said that because the motorbike blocked his car and he shouldn’t park his motorbike there, so the accuser removed the motorbike. The defendant, since you disagree with the accuser, so you had a quarrel.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the part about the argument and physical confrontation that occurred after the motorcycle was moved.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time and date information at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include commas to separate clauses in several places.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'accuser' instead of 'neighbor' to refer to 張大明.

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
基本上就是事發的原因。我想強調的是，這不是我們第一次因為移動車子的事而發生口角了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the motorbike in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '因為移動車子的事' (because of moving the car) at the end of the sentence instead of after '口角了' (argued).

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
Do you mean that you both had a quarrel upon the issue of parking space, and it was not the first time, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我已經住在這個社區至少八個月了，那告訴人也是不止一次挪動我的摩托車，而且每次都是無緣無故的。他就只是不喜歡我把摩托車停在那裡，他根本沒有任何立場可以這樣做。所有住在這個社區的人都有權利把車停在可停的地方。

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever been to the police station for such kind of incident and to have to make a statement?

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
我們之前發生口角的時候，我都會盡量的避免衝突，有時候我還不在意他挪動我的摩托車，那也有一些時候我會假裝什麼事都沒發生。要回答這個問題，就是我都沒有去警察局備案過，但其他鄰居有發生過類似的事情。

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
In your community, are there particular parking spaces for the motorbikes?

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，我們沒有固定的停放位置，只要有空間就可以停放，也就是採取先到先有的方式。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not having a fixed parking spot.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So you mean that if there are any parking spaces or any empty spaces, everyone is OK to park there, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
沒錯，只要有空位大家就可以停車。

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Are there any slots on your parking spot?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'painted' in the translation.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
是的，市府有畫超過10個專屬機車的停車格。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
In the investigator and record page 45, there is a picture and the picture shows that in your community, every motorcycle has their own marked parking slot, the defendant, please confirm.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，照片裡面就顯示了我們社區的摩托車都有專屬停車格。

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
So on that day, why did you... how did the quarrel evolve into physical confrontation?

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我看到我的摩托車被挪動時，我正站在樓上看，所以我就趕快衝下樓察看。就像我剛剛說的，這已經不是第一次有人移動我的摩托車了，所以我那次真的不想要再忍了。當我下樓的時候，我看到告訴人把他的手放在我的機車把手上，我就問他說：「你在做什麼！」但他並沒有回我，所以我就衝上前試圖要阻止他。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
What you meant was when you stepped forward and tried to stop the plaintiff, so you pushed against each other, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
沒錯，當我將我的手放在機車把手上的時候，告訴人並沒有把手鬆開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '告訴人並沒有把手鬆開' instead of '告訴人並沒有把手鬆開'.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Did you remember who made the move first?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'remember' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得那時候我嘗試要把他的手推開
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
In investigatory record, one on page 8, there is a inquiry made at the police station. On page 9, line 10, you said that the other party was grabbing the handlebars tightly and you tried to push his hands away. As you mentioned, you said that you made the move first, is that moved this move?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the other party was forcefully trying to move the motorcycle.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'moved' before the noun 'this move', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
沒錯，那就是我在事發過後做的筆錄。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'statements' in their translation.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他並沒有鬆開手，反而更用力地抓住把手。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'move' from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'even more tightly' before the verb 'grabbed', which is incorrect.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
Therefore, you mean that the accused not only let go the handlebars. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars with much force.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes.
沒錯。

接下來發生什麼事呢？
What happened next?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the event.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
因為他的肢體語言告訴我說他並不想要放開，所以我就推了他的肩膀，希望他可以鬆開把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
Therefore, you pushed his shoulder, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我有推他的肩膀。

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.

The following is the investigatory record one, page 48, it is a diagnosis from the city Union Hospital. In the diagnosis, the doctor pointed out that on the body and arms of the plaintiff, there were multiple bruises and scratches, so is your pushing his shoulders caused this injury?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of '挫傷' (bruises) and only translated '瘀青' (scratches).
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user added the phrase 'so is your pushing his shoulders caused this injury?' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not correct. It should be 'Did your pushing his shoulders cause this injury?'

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，當我女朋友要把手機拿出來錄影的時候，告訴人就警告他說不要拍，但他根本沒有權力這樣做。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation changes the relationship between the individuals involved, from 'plaintiff' and 'her' to '告訴人' and '我女朋友'.

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The accused, at 7:50 p.m., June 18th, 2020, you had a quarrel with your neighbor because of…because of the removal of the motorcycle in front of your home. …And then the quarrel become…became a physical confrontation.The first evident is on page 8 of the investigatory record, that is the statements made at the police station.According to what you stated in the police station, you got home at about 6:30 p.m., after you parked your motorcycle, you entered your home and went upstair.After you had dinner, you look…to the first floor, and you saw someone moving your motorcycle and then you immediately went there to understand what was happening.After you went downstair, you saw Chang Da-ming, the accuser of this case, moving your motorcycle.You asked him, why he…You asked him about why he moved your motorcycle. And he answered, it was because your motorcycle blocked his car, and besides you were not supposed to park your motorcycle there. And that’s why he moved your motorcycle.You two had a quarrel because you didn’t accept his statement. Is that true?

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
呃…對…基本上事情就是這麼經過的。我得說，這並不是我們第一次因為停摩托車的問題起口角。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the motorbike in the argument.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order in the sentence.

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
You mean it was not the first time you two had a quarrel about where to park the motorcycle?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'two' which is important for indicating that there were two people involved in the quarrel.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我在那個社區已經住了大概八個月…在這之間告訴人有很多次都未經任何提示或說明就亂移我的摩托車。他就是不喜歡我把摩托車停在那裡，但是他沒有任何立場以及理由去做這件事。住在這個社區裡面的人本來就有權力把車停在…把車子或摩托車停在空位上，只要那個位子是可以的。

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever been the police station for record for such incident?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
當我們起口角的時候，我都會盡全力避免有進一步的衝突，很多時候我也不會去在乎他亂移我的摩托車，有時候我甚至會裝作我不知道。那麼回到你的問題，我從來沒有在警察局備案過，但是其他得鄰居其實有遇到類似的情況。

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
In your community, are there any stable parking slots for motorcycle?

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，基本上只要有空格我們就能把車子停在裡面，那這個概念就有點像是你先到就可以先停。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of parking in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect in the translation.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So, about the parking of motorcycles. You mean that one park his or her motorcycle whenever there is an empty space, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
是的，只要有空位就可以把摩托車停進去。

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
So, about the parking spaces, are they the parking slots, that means… that means… are there any lines and blocks on it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
沒有錯，是政府有在那裏畫了超過十個摩托車的停車格。

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
According to page 24 of the investigatory record, in the picture there are actually parking slots in your community, the accused, please check the picture.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，照片裡面就是我們社區的摩托車停車格。

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
At that day, how come your quarrel become a physical confrontation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當時我在樓上，當我看到有人在移我摩托車的時候，我馬上就衝到樓下。如我剛剛所說的，這並不是第一次有人移我的摩托車，而在那天晚上，我覺得我不想再忍下去了。我下樓的時候看到告訴人正抓著我的把手，所以我走向前問他說他到底在做甚麼，但是他沒有回答，於是我就出手阻止他繼續動我的摩托車。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'the plaintiff' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '告訴人' (the plaintiff) after the verb '看到' (saw), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
You mean…you two had…physical contact like pushing because you want him to stop moving your motorcycle, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
沒錯，在我出手要拿回我的摩托車把手的時候，他也沒有放手。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Do you remember…do you remember…how it begin…begin like who hit who first?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得是我先想要把他的手推開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
…In the investigatory record page 8, the question and answer in the police station.On page 9 line 10, you stated that the accuser tried to force to move your motorcycle, so you pushed his hands away from your handle bar.You said you are the first one started the physical confrontation, is that what you mean?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
沒錯，這是我在事件發生以後在警察局提供的筆錄。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'statements' in the translation.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
When you pushed the other party’s hand away, what was his reaction?

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有鬆手，他甚至掐得更用力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect. The correct translation should be '他甚至更用力地掐住把手。'

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
You mean, the other party grabbed the handle bar of your motorcycle even more tightly instead of letting it go, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes.
沒有錯。

接下來發生什麼事呢？
Then what happened next?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the original text.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
因為他的肢體語言告訴我，他並沒有要鬆手，所以我接下來推他的肩膀，希望他可以因此放手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
As a result, you pushed his shoulder, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
沒錯，我推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我推了他的肩膀' instead of '我推了他的肩膀。'

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Did you do that with… a strong force or not?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，我只是輕輕地推一下，大概就是我們平常制止別人的時候會用的那個力道。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只是輕輕地推一下'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'gentle push' is not accurately conveyed in the translation. It should be translated as '輕輕地推'.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
Let’s move to page 48 of the investigatory record that’s is the therapy statement of 聯合hospital.In the statement of the doctor, … he stated that there are multiple bruises and contusions on the accuser’s body and arm. Is that what you caused? Is that caused because you pushed him?

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我也不知道那些瘀青跟傷是怎麼造成的，我真的不知道，那不是我做的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'injuries' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我真的不知道' (I really don't know) in the wrong position in the sentence.

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there any witness of what happened that day, in other words, is there anyone can explain what happened that night for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
那晚我和我女朋友在一起，她也在我家，所以她也知道我下樓去，那麼她也知道我和告訴人之間發生過的事情。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the neighbor and the history between the speaker and the neighbor.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
Do you mean that your girlfriend witnessed what happened that night?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
在我們發生衝突了以後，我女朋友也來到樓下，並且她原本也想要用手機錄影 以防我們以後要…證據來證明說那晚發生了甚麼事
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'middle of the confrontation' and 'just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在我們發生衝突了以後' (after we had a conflict) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '我女朋友也來到樓下' (my girlfriend also came downstairs).
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include any punctuation marks in the translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '證據' (evidence) instead of 'clip' to refer to the video recording.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
Please state more precisely when did your girlfriend came up…down stair and try to film the whole confrontation by her phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
她在我第一次要奪回我的把手的時候就下來了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她在我第一次要把手的時候就下來了。'

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she successfully film the confrontation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'later' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，在她一把手機拿出來，告訴人就警告她不准這樣做，但是他明明就沒有權利這樣要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '告訴人' (the person who told) before the action '警告' (warned), resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'He had no right to tell her that' as '但是他明明就沒有權利這樣要求' which means 'But he clearly has no right to demand like this', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
Then, that’s the end of my questions.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The accused, today’s case is the primary…preparatory procedure, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
有的，我希望能夠幫我調閱當天…的…兩台監視器裡面的畫面
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the CCTV cameras.

The defendant, you have the argument with your neighbor then you have the physical confrontation at your home at 7:50 p.m. on June 18th in 2020. First evidence is on the investigatory file page 8. There is record on the police station. In the investigatory record, you said that you came home at 6:30 p.m. and you parked your motorbike. Then, you go upstairs.

When you came downstairs, you found out that the accuser, Chang da-min was moving your motorbike. You ask the accuse why you’re moving my motorbike. The accuser answered that because your motorbike was blocking my way of my car. And you shouldn’t parked your motorbike on that position. Therefore, I move your motorbike.

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of arguing in their translation.

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
Did you mean that you and the accuser argue with your position of the motorbike many times?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason.

我離開這個社區已經八個月了。在這段時間裡面，告訴人已經想要移動我的摩托車超過一次了。他只是不喜歡我將我的摩托車放在那個位置。但他沒有立場這麼做。在這個社區裡面，每個人都有權利去停放他的摩托車，只要有空位。

之前發生爭吵的時候，我會盡量避免和告訴人發生爭吵。有時候我會阻止它移動我的摩托車。有時候我會當作沒有發生一樣。先回答你剛剛的問題，我沒有去警局備案過。其他鄰居也有發生相同的問題。

沒有，我們可以停放在任何有空位的地方，這是一個先到先有的權利。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'empty' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？

grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我在樓上看到有人正在移動我的摩托車時，我就馬上衝下樓想要查看發生了什麼事。 讓像我剛說的，這已經不是他第一次移動我的摩托車了。但我實在是已經忍無可忍了。當我下樓時，我看到告訴人把他的手放在我的摩托車手把上。我問他你到底在做什麼。但他沒有回答。所以我想要向前去阻止他移動我的摩托車。

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
Do you mean that because he trying to move your motorbike. Then you want to stop him. Therefore, you have some physical confrontation, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of physical confrontation in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect in the sentence 'Then you want to stop him.' It should be 'Then you wanted to stop him.'

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
沒錯，當我想要將我的摩托車拿回來的時候他並沒有放手。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of putting out hands before trying to hold the handlebars.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？

我記得我想要把他的手推開
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
The statement made at the police station is on the investigatory record page 8. On the page 9 line 10. You have mention that the accuser grabbed your motorbike handlebar. Therefore, your try to remove his hands on the handlebar. You just mentioned that you take the action first. Does that mean the movement?

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
是的，這就是在事發後我在警局做的筆錄。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'statements' in the translation.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
When you remove the hands of the accuser. What’s his reaction?

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有移動而且甚至更用力地抓住我的機車把手。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the possessive pronoun '我的' (my) before '機車把手' (handlebars), which is not present in the original text.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
Do you mean that the accuser did not let his hands go? And he grab the handle bar with much force.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The translation is missing punctuation marks.

Yes.
是的，沒錯

接下來發生什麼事呢？
Then, what’s happened?

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
因為他的肢體語言告訴我說他不會放開我的摩托車。所以我推了他的肩膀迫使他放開我的摩托車。

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '以防之後我想要證明我的清白' (in case I want to prove my innocence later) at the end of the sentence, which disrupts the original word order.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
Please be accurate. When were your girlfriend arrived the situation. Did she filmed the incident with her cellphone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

他抵達事發現場當我第一次想要阻止他移動我的摩托車的時候

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she film the incident successfully?

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，當我女友拿出手機的時候。告訴人就警告我女友不能拍，但是他沒有權力這麼說。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'plaintiff' as '告訴人' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'plaintiff'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff warning the girlfriend not to take out her cell phone.

那我的問題先問到這裡。

Since he found out there is a motorbike parking in front of his house, and he tried to move the motorbike to the other place. Therefore, he has the quarrels with the accuser, which become the physical confrontation.After the incident, the accuser went to the hospital to check his injuries, and he found out that there are many bruises on his body.

I plead not guilty.
無罪答辯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '答辯無罪'.

今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
Today, we’re her for the preparatory procedure, and both party are able to express your opinion toward this evidence.In today’s procedure, the accused do not hire his lawyer, so the accused will speak for himself. Do both of you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

了解。
Yes, I do. I understand.

I understand.
我也了解。

請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
Prosecute, please check and confirm the evidence using in this case.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the part about the prosecutor asking questions.

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
是，這基本上就是事情的經過。我還要強調一點，像這種情況並不是第一次發生，我之前也要求過他移動摩托車。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '我之前也要求過他移動摩托車' which is not present in the original text.

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
You mean that this was not the first argument with respect to the parking location of the motorbike?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我已經在這個社區住了八個月的時間，但告訴人並非第一次試圖移動我的摩托車。他只是很討厭我把車子停在那邊，但他沒有任何理由這麼做。在社區裡，每個人都有權利去停放自己的汽車或機車在有空位的地方。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '但告訴人並非第一次試圖移動我的摩托車' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但被告不是第一次試圖移動我的摩托車'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '在社區裡，每個人都有權利去停放自己的汽車或機車在有空位的地方' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '在社區裡，每個人都有權利在有空位的地方停放自己的汽車或機車'.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Then, have both party went to the Police station and have the identical record for the same incident?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
我們之前的確有過口角，但都沒有發展成肢體衝突。有時候，我甚至會對摩托車被移走的這件事視而不見。先回答前一個問題，我從來沒有到警局備過案，但我知道有些鄰居也發生過相同的問題。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using '肢體衝突' instead of '對抗'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misinterpreting the meaning of '摩托車被移走'

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
Do you have the regular places that everyone parks their motorbike in your community?

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，事實上，我們可以把車停在任何有空位的停車格裡，基本上就是先到先有的概念。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'park' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '停' (stop) before the noun '車' (car), resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'park' as '停' (stop) instead of '停車' (park the car).

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
In terms of the parking of the motorbike, basically you can park your motorbike wherever you want if there is a place.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
沒錯，只要有看到空位，每個人都可以將他的車輛停在裡面。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'motorbike' in the translation.

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Is there any block on where the car parking?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
有的，市政府有畫了十多個停車個在那邊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'designated' which is important for understanding that the parking spaces are specifically designated for motorcycles.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order should be '市政府有畫了十多個停車個在那邊' instead of '有的，市政府有畫了十多個停車個在那邊'.

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
According to the investigatory record on p.24, there’s a photo shows there are parking lot in the accused’s community. Please check these photos.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'drawn' in '有畫停車格', which means 'painted parking spaces'.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，在照片裡的是我家附近的機車停車格。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'neighborhood' in their translation.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
Then, how did the situation turned out the be the physical confrontation after the argument.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the argument in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'the situation turned out' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'how'.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我在樓上看到有陌生人在移動我的摩托車時，我就趕緊下樓察看。就像我剛說的，有人移動我摩托車已經不是第一次，那天下午，我覺得我已經忍無可忍了。當我下樓時，我看到告訴人正把手放在我的機車上，問他他在幹什麼，但對方沉默不語，於是我就上前阻止他。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
You mean that when you were trying to move your motorbike, and you came up to stop him. That’s the reason why the physical confrontation happened?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
沒錯，當我上前準備抓住我的摩托車把手時，他卻沒有放手。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Do you still remember who was the first one attack the other?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得那個時候我試圖把他的手推開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
The statement made at the Police Station, it’s also investigatory record one is as follows.On P.9, line 10, you mentioned that the other party grabbed the motorbike tightly, you tried to let him take the hand out of the handlebars.You just mentioned that you’re the first one to attack him, do you mean that was such behavior you move?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
是的，這就跟我在警局裡提到的一樣，在衝突發生之後。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'statements' from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在衝突發生之後' (after the incident happened) at the end of the sentence instead of after '提到的一樣' (as mentioned).

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
What’s his reaction when you tried to take his hands out your motorbike?

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有要放手的打算，反之，他抓得更用力了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他没有要放手的打算' instead of '他没有要放手的打算'.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
You mean that he didn’t tried to move his hand: rather, he grabbed the handlebar more tightly?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes.
null

接下來發生什麼事呢？
And what happened next?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the original text.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
從他的肢體語言來看，我相信他終究是不會放手的，所以我就用力推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我相信他終究是不會放手的' instead of '從他的肢體語言來看，我相信他終究是不會放手的'.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
So, you pushed his shoulder, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
沒錯，我推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我推了他的肩膀' instead of '我推了他的肩膀。'

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Do you think that you did it with much force at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，我只是輕輕地推他，就像我們平常會輕輕地碰一下對方的肩膀，告訴他們去做些什麼事情這樣。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
Next, let’s look at the p.48 on the investigatory record one, it’s the treatment result came from the Capital United Hospital.According to this file, we can see there are many bruises on the accuser’s body and arms, do you have any idea how did he injured? Does it come from your push on his shoulder?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of multiple bruises and only mentioned bruises on the body and arms.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the context of the doctor's diagnosis and the mention of multiple bruises.

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我不曉得他身上的那些瘀青是怎麼來的，我認為不是我做的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不曉得那些瘀青或傷口是怎麼來的，我沒有做那件事。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'bruises or injuries' as '他身上的那些瘀青' is incorrect. It should be translated as '那些瘀青或傷口'.

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there anyone are able to prove what you just mentioned and what happened that evening?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
當天我和我的女朋友待在一起，所以她有看到我下樓，她也很清楚過去我和我那位鄰居之間的衝突。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the girlfriend was at home that evening.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '我和我的女朋友' (me and my girlfriend) before the verb '待在一起' (were together), which is incorrect in Chinese. The correct word order should be '我和我的女朋友當天待在一起' (My girlfriend and I were together that evening).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'she knew' as '她有看到' (she saw), which does not convey the same meaning. 'She knew' implies that the girlfriend was aware of something, not just physically seeing it.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the girlfriend was aware of the history between the speaker and the neighbor.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
Do you mean that your girlfriend witnessed what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
我的女朋友在我們爭執到一半的時候就下樓查看，她也試圖拿手機錄下事情發生的經過，以防之後可能會使用到。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'middle of the confrontation' in the translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'to prove what happened' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在我們爭執到一半的時候' (in the middle of our argument) after '我的女朋友' (my girlfriend), resulting in a word order error.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '以防之後可能會使用到' (in case we might need to use it later) before '試圖拿手機錄下事情發生的經過' (attempted to film what happened with her cell phone), resulting in a word order error.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
More specifically, what’s the timing that your girlfriend witnessed the incident and tried to film the video.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
就在我第一次試圖要抓住機車把手時，我的女朋友就下來了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'arriving at the scene' and replaced it with 'my girlfriend coming down'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我的女朋友' (my girlfriend) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '就下來了' (came down).

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she film the video she want?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the success or failure of filming.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，當我的女朋友拿出手機時，對方就立馬制止了我的女朋友，說她並沒有權力這麼做。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning by stating that the plaintiff immediately stopped the user's girlfriend and claimed that she had no right to do so.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
Then, that’s all the questions for you.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The accused, today is only the preparatory procedure. Do you need to court investigate any evidence for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
是的。我希望法院這邊能幫我調出兩個監視器畫面以查看當天的情況。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the CCTV cameras.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '調出' (retrieve) before the object '兩個監視器畫面' (two CCTV camera footage), which is incorrect.

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
You mean that there are CCTVs in your community, and you’d like to ask the court to find the clips at the time?Can you give us the timing more specifically so that we can know what is the timing of the CCTV clips?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the court in their translation, which is a critical detail in the original text.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the request for the court to review the CCTV footage in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect in their translation.

I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The defendant, the incident happened at 7:50 pm on June 18th, 2020 in front of your door. You had a quarrel with your neighbor about moving your motorcycle. At first it was only a little argument, but it became physical confrontation. The first evidence is as stated in page 8 investigatory file. It is the statements made at the police station. As stated in the statements made at the police station, you said that you went home on that day at 6:30 pm. You parked your car and then went home. After that you were having dinner, then you looked downstairs and saw someone moving your motorcycle, so you went downstairs to take a look at what was happening. When you went downstairs, you found out the one who was moving your motorcycle was your neighbor, Da-Ming Chang, which is the accuser. He was moving your motorcycle. You asked the accuser why did he move your motorcycle. The accuser answered that because your motorcycle was blocking his car, and you shouldn’t park your motorcycle at that place, so he moved your motorcycle. Because you disagreed with his statement, so you had quarrels with him, right?

semantic conversion	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the idiomatic expression '衍生成肢體衝突' (became physical confrontation) in the translation.

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
是的，基本上那就是事發經過。我想要強調這不是第一次我們因為我的摩托車停放位置吵架。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
Do you mean that both parties have already had arguments about where the motorcycle is parked before?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我在這個社區已經住了八個月了，告訴人他已經多次嘗試移動我的摩托車。他只是不滿和看不慣我把車子停在那裏。這個社區的所有住戶都有權利可以在這個停車場停放自己的汽車或機車，只要有空位。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'without any reason' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '告訴人' (plaintiff) at the beginning of the sentence, which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他已經多次嘗試移動我的摩托車，告訴人' (The plaintiff has tried to move my motorcycle multiple times).
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include any punctuation marks in the translation, making it difficult to understand the sentence structure.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the phrase '這個停車場' (this parking lot) instead of '那裏' (there) in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever been to the police station to report cases about these kinds of arguments?

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
之前發生口角的時候我都會盡量避免肢體衝突。有時候我甚至不會在乎他移動我的摩托車，有時候我會假裝沒有看到。回答剛才的問題，我沒有去警局備過案，但其他鄰居有相似的經驗。

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
In your community, do the motorcycles have their own specific parking slot?

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，我們基本上是只要有空位就可以停。基本上是採先到先有的制度。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about parking being on a first-come-first-serve basis.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So about the parking of the motorcycle, everyone can park his or her own motorcycle if there is an empty space, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
是的，只要有空位任何人都可以停放他的機車。

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Is there a parking slot at where you park your motorcycle?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'motorcycle' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'motorcycle' at the end of the sentence instead of before the verb 'park'.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
是的，市政府已經有劃分十個特定的機車空位給我們停放。

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
According to the investigatory file page number 24’s picture. In the defendant’s community, the parking spaces for motorcycles indeed have parking slots. The defendant, please check this picture.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，照片上的確是我社區裡面給摩托車停放的停車格。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'picture' in their translation.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
Then how did the arguments you had that day evolve into physical confrontation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'you had' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order of the sentence.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
那天我在樓上看到有人在樓下移動我的機車，所以我就趕下樓看發生什麼事。就像我說的，這已經不是第一次有人移動我的摩托車。那天晚上我就是感覺不想再忍受這樣的事情了。當我下樓時我看到告訴人他雙手緊抓著我的把手。我問他在幹嘛，但他沒有回答我，於是我上前阻擋他的去路。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'from upstairs' in the first sentence, which provides important context.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'that night' in the third sentence, which adds to the sense of frustration and urgency.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'the plaintiff' in the fifth sentence, which clarifies who the person is.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '告訴人' (plaintiff) before the verb '看到' (saw), resulting in incorrect word order.

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
Do you mean that he was trying to move your motorcycle, and you stepped forward to try to block him, so there was some push and pull between you?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
是的，當我試著想要用雙手我摩托車的把手，他卻沒有放手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我試著想要用雙手握住我摩托車的把手'.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Then do you remember who started the fight first?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得是我先想要把他的手推開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
According to the investigatory file page number 8, there are the statements made at the police station. According the tenth line on page 9, the accuser held on the handlebars very tightly, and tried to move away your motorcycle, so you went forward and tried to push away his hands. You just mentioned that you attacked first, did you mean this move?

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
是的，這就是我在警局筆錄裡所陳述的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'statements' in the translation.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
After you pushed away his hands, what was the other party’s reaction?

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有因此放手，反而他更用力的握住把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他反而更用力地握住把手。'

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
So you mean that the accuser did not let go of the handlebars, but instead grabbed it more tightly, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes.
是的沒錯。

接下來發生什麼事呢？
Then after that, what happened?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of what happened.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
因為他的肢體語言告訴我他不會放開我的把手，所以我就推了一下他的肩膀，想要讓他放手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
So you pushed his shoulder, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我推了他的肩膀' instead of '我推了他的肩膀。'

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Then do you think that you pushed his shoulder with much force?

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，在我記憶中我只是輕輕推了他的肩膀一下。就像有時候我們希望對方停止動作的時候的輕推。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions a 'gentle push' while the user's translation mentions '輕輕推了他的肩膀一下' which means 'lightly pushed his shoulder'. The user's translation does not capture the idea of pushing someone to do or not do something.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
Next we are going to show the 48th page on investigatory file 1. This is a medical receipt according to the Capital United Hospital. In the hospitalization, the accuser’s body and arms had many injuries and bruises. How did that occur, was it because you pushed him?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the doctor's diagnosis in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the sentence, resulting in a grammatically incorrect structure.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'investigatory file' instead of 'medical receipt' in the translation.

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我完全不知道那些擦傷還有瘀青是怎麼來的，那不是我造成的。

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there anyone who can prove your statements of what you just said? Or about what happened that night?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'what you just said' in the translation.

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
當天我的女朋友也在我家，他知道我要下樓查看，他也非常清楚我和我鄰居之前有過這樣的爭執。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'evening' from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '我的女朋友' (my girlfriend) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the time phrase '當天' (that day).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '他' (he) instead of '她' (she) to refer to '我的女朋友' (my girlfriend).

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
Do you mean that your girlfriend saw what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
他在我們爭執的時候就下樓了。他非常堅持要用手機錄下視頻，以便之後需要。

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '他' (he) instead of '她' (she) to refer to the protagonist.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
More specifically speaking, when did your girlfriend arrive at the scene and tried to film?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
他下樓的時候我正第一次試圖要抓住我摩托車的把手
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she successfully film the process of your quarre
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'later' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'successfully' in the wrong position in the sentence.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，正當他要把手機拿出來錄影的時候，告訴人告訴他不要這麼做，但告訴人沒有權利制止他。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'plaintiff' as '告訴人' which means 'informant' instead of '原告' which means 'plaintiff'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '錄影' (to record) before the noun '手機' (cell phone), resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'when she took out her cell phone' which provides important context for the plaintiff's warning.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the phrase 'He had no right to tell her that' which explains the plaintiff's objection to the warning.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
Then I have no further questions.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The defendant, today is a preliminary preparatory procedure. Before the next court, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate on your behalf?

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
有的，我想要請法院查看並調閱那兩個監視器畫面查看當天的事發經過。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'taken' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '查看' (to view) before the noun phrase '那兩個監視器畫面' (the two CCTV cameras). The correct word order should be '調閱那兩個監視器畫面查看' (to review the footage from the two CCTV cameras).

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
Do you mean that there are CCTVs placed in your community, and you hope we can retrieve the CCTV clip and take a look? If that is true, can you please say where and when you want us to take a look on the CCTV clip? Can you offer a more specific time?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific location in the community where the CCTVs are placed.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not provide a specific time for the assistant to retrieve the CCTV clip.

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The defendant. At 7:50 p.m. on June 18th 2020. In front of your house, you had an argument and which leads to a physical confrontation with your neighbor because of your motorcycle was moved.

So you mean this is not the first time had an argument about the parking place of your motorbike?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'both sides' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'had' before the subject 'this', resulting in incorrect word order.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.

並沒有，我們並沒有固定的停車格，只要有位子，縣道的人就能將車子停放在那裏。

當我發現我的機車正在被移動時，我利馬衝下樓查看是怎麼一回事，如同我剛剛所說，這不是第一次有人移動我的摩托車了，而剛好在那天下午我不想再忍受了，當我下樓查看時，告訴人的雙手放在把手上移動著它，我也問他他在做甚麼他卻不回答，所以我走向前

Check and confirm the investigatory record of the statement made at the police station. At page nine line ten. The record says that the accuser grabs your motorbike tightly and don’t want let go, so you try to remove his hand from your motorbike. So you said that you started the confrontation which indicate this movement

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
What’s the reaction of the accuser when you try to remove his hand from your motorbike?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'accuser' and 'motorbike' in the translation.

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他並沒有移開，相反的他更用力的掐握著我的摩托車
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
So the accuser did not remove his hand from your motorbike. Instead, he grabs your motorbike even more tightly
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'accuser' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

Yes.
是的沒錯

接下來發生什麼事呢？
Then what happened next?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the original text.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
從他的肢體上看來他並沒有想要放開我的摩托車，所以我推了他的肩膀，希望他可以離開我的摩托車

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
Let’s check and confirm the investigatory record one on page 48. This is the result of 聯合hospital. In the diagnose record. It shows that accuser’s arm and multiple body part have bruises and injuries. Are these injuries caused by the push?

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific time frame 'that night' in the translation.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '那個時候我的女友正在家中'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor' is incorrect. It should be translated as '她也知道我和那位鄰居之間的歷史'.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
So your girlfriend witness what happened at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
我女友下來察看時,衝突已經開始了，她有拿出手機來拍攝下這些過程，以方之後我們有需要證據來證明
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	omission of details	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
To be more precisely, when did your girlfriend went down stair and took out her phone and film this incident?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she film the scene successfully?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the subject 'she' filming something.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'film' before the subject 'she', which is incorrect in English.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有 正當我女友拿出手機拍時，告訴人就制止她，但他並沒有任何權力這麼做
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user's translation suggests that the plaintiff had no right to stop the girlfriend from taking out her cell phone, while the original text states that the plaintiff warned her not to do that.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
There’s no further question.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The accused. Today is the preliminarily preparatory procedure. Is there any evidence that you would like to ask the court to investigate for you for the next court?

After the accuser went to the hospital, the doctor said that there are many bruises and scratches on the accuser’s arm, so the accuser was going to sue the accused. And according to the Criminal Law No.375, the accused violated the attack. What’s your plea?

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The defendant, at the time of 7:50 pm, June 18, 2020, you had a quarrel and physical confrontation with your neighborhood in front of your house because of the move of your motorcycle. In the investigatory record 1 page 8, on that page there is the statement made at the police station. As the statement stated, you said that you went home at 6:30. After you parked your motorcycle, you went upstairs. After you finished, you looked down from the window and see someone wanted to move your motorcycle. After you went down and checked, you found that your neighborhood, Da Ming Chang, was moving your motorcycle. You asked the accuser why he moved your motorcycle and he replied that your motorcycle was obstacle, and you shouldn’t park at that place. Because you can not accept his statement, so you have argument, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of the argument escalating into a physical confrontation
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'As the statement stated, you said that you went home at 6:30'

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	translated '告訴人' as 'accuser' instead of 'neighborhood'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	translated '口角' as 'quarrel' instead of 'argument'

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
我只是想強調這已經不是第一次為了停車的事情吵架。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the motorbike in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '為了停車的事情' (for the parking issue) at the end of the sentence instead of after '吵架' (argued).

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
So you mean that it was not the first time that you have argument with each other because of the parking place of the motorcycle.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'argument' instead of 'dispute'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	not understanding the significance of 'arguing over parking place'

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我住在那個社區八個月了，告訴人不只一次的想要移動我的機車，而且都沒有原因。他不喜歡我把我把我的車子停在那哩，但已經沒有其他可以停的地方了。如果有空位的話，社區的每個人都有權利把他們的交通工具停在那個地方，如果有空位的話。

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever reported to the police about this condition.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific context of '口角' (argument) and '備過案' (reported to the police).

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
之前發生口角，我都會避免肢體衝突，有時候我並不在意他移動我的車，我甚至會假裝沒發生過這件事。回到你的問題，我並沒有去警察局備案過，但其他鄰居也有發生過類似的經驗。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'avoiding confrontation' in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of 'quarrels' in the translation.
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	The user added the phrase '肢體衝突' (physical conflict) which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '回到你的問題' (to answer your question) which is not present in the original text.

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
Are there available parking spaces in your community?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of motorcycles in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in their translation.

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有固定的位子，只要有空位就可以停，通常是只要有車位，你就可以先停進去。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of parking being on a first-come-first-serve basis.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So you mean that about the issue parking of motorcycle, everyone can park their motorcycle if there are empty spaces.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
 對，只要有空位，每個人都可以停在那裏。

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
In your community, are there any parking slots with lines?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
沒錯，市政府有在我們的社區裡劃很多停車格。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the specific information that the designated parking spaces are for motorcycles.

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
According to the investigatory record 1 page 24, and there is a photo, the photo shows that in the community, there actually parking slots. The defendant, please make sure of it.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，照片裡的停車格是讓摩托車停的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the neighborhood in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '停' (stop) before the noun '摩托車' (motorcycle), resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '讓' (let) instead of '為' (for), resulting in a different meaning.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
What’s your reason that your argument evolved into physical confrontation on that day?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of an argument or disagreement that led to the physical confrontation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'evolved' before the subject 'argument', resulting in incorrect word order.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我在樓上看到有人想移動我的摩托車時，我立刻衝了下去。就像我說的，這已經不是第一次，我已經沒辦法再容忍這樣的事情發生了。當我下樓的時候，我看到告訴人正在抓著我摩托車的把手，我問他在做什麼，但他沒有回答，所以我向前想要把我的摩托車拿回來。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
You mean that the accuser was moving your motorcycle, and you stepped forward to stop him so you have some physical confrontation like pushing, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
是的，當我上前試著抓住我的把手，但他卻緊握著不放
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我試著抓住我的把手' instead of '當我上前試著抓住我的把手'.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Do you remember who is the first one to hit the other party?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be changed to 'was' to match the past tense of the sentence.

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得是我想把他的手挪開我的把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
I’m going to show you the questioning statement in police station on the investigatory record 1 page 8. On the page 9 line10, you said the accuser grabbed your handlebar tightly. And he insist to move your motorcycle, so stepped forward to remove his hands. As what you mentioned, you said that you have the physical action first, do the mean the action is removing his hands?

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
對，這是在事件發生後我到警局作的筆錄。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'statements' in the translation.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
After you remove the other party’s hands, what was his interaction

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他不但沒有把他的手移開，還更用力把我的把手抓得更緊。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '我的把手' (my handlebars) which is not present in the original text.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
You mean that the accuser grabbed your handlebar tightly instead of removing his hand?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes.
是的。

接下來發生什麼事呢？
Then what happened next?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the original text.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
從他的肢體動作，可以看到他是完全沒有想放開我的摩托車，所以我推了他肩膀，希望他可以放開我的把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '從他的肢體動作，可以看到他完全沒有想放開我的摩托車'.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
So you pushed his shoulder because of this?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我推了他的肩膀
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，我只是輕輕推一下，就像我們平常要制止別人時推他的力道一
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
 I’m going to show the investigatory record 1 page 48. There is a medical report from the United Hospital. In the medical report, there were many hurts and bruises on the accuser’s body and arms. Is that caused by your pushing?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the doctor's diagnosis and only mentioned the hurts and bruises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'Is that caused by your pushing?' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'many hurts and bruises'.

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我不知道為什麼他身上會有那些挫傷和瘀青，我並沒有做。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'injuries' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '他身上' (on his body) before '為什麼' (why), resulting in a word order error.

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
If there anyone can be your witness of the content you state and what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
那天晚上，我女朋友在我家，他知道我下樓查看這件事，而且他也知道我和告訴人已經有很多次口角了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我女朋友在我家那天晚上' instead of '那天晚上，我女朋友在我家'.

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '告訴人' is used instead of '那個鄰居' to refer to the neighbor. It should be '我和那個鄰居之間的歷史' instead of '我和告訴人已經有很多次口角了'.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
Do you mean that your girlfriend is a witness of the incident?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
我女朋友那時候也下樓，並且在我們爭執時想錄下影片，就是為了可以讓影片當成證據。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'middle of the confrontation' and 'what happened'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed '也' (also) before '下樓' (came down), which changes the meaning of the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened' as '就是為了可以讓影片當成證據' which does not convey the same meaning.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
Certainly, when did your girlfriend arrive at the scene, and try to film what happened?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
她在我第一次想要奪回把手時抵達現場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她在我第一次想要把手時抵達現場。'

後來她有拍成功嗎？
So did she successfully film?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, 'she', which is crucial for understanding the question.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.

我和老公結婚3年了，但是年齡差距太大了，大約有30歲。以前我們談戀愛的時候，我不知道我們有很多價值觀不匹配，所以結婚後，我發現我一點也不幸福。我平時和老公溝通不好，而且他對一切都高度懷疑。他總是以關心的名義詢問我去了哪裡，遇見了誰。一開始我以為是他的關心，但隨著時間的推移，我覺得他越來越認真了。關於關心我。比如說，如果我告訴他我要去崇光百貨，但我帶著清風廣場的包回來後，他就會生氣，問很多關於我的事情。有時候，我不想解釋，但情況卻變得更糟。這種情況從我們結婚之初就開始了。我真的厭倦了這個。另外，我的丈夫是法國人，我的家人都不會說法語，所以我的家人都無法與他交談。雖然我不和家人住在一起，但每逢節假日或特殊場合，我們都會聚在一起。我病了好幾天，所以我媽媽來我家照顧我。由於語言障礙，我丈夫和我母親發生了很多衝突。我在他們之間做了很長一段時間的中間人，我覺得厭倦了，所以我想提出離婚。
I’ve been married for 3 years, but I want to divorce because the gap in age and we about 20 days. When we were in relationship, I didn’t find out  that our values are different. But after marriage, I didn’t feel happy. We didn’t have a great communication with each other for many times, and he is highly suspicious. He often ask me where I go to and who I’m with in the name of concern. At first, I though he just concern me, but he got more and more suspicious. For example, if I told him I will go to, went to Sogo at Shihlin, but i went back home with the shopping bag with breeze plaza, he will ask for me a lot of questions and got angry. Sometime, I didn’t want to explain, the situation gets worse. when I come home I carry merchandise of breeze plaza, then he will ask for many things and sometimes he get angry. Sometimes, I don’t wat to explain, and the situations gets worse. Such a situation begins when we got married, and I felt exhausted. Moreover, my husband is France; however, my parents cannot speak French, so they cannot also communicate with him. families don’t speak French. Therefore, they cannot communicate at all. Although I separate with my parents, we get together on holidays or special occasions. I was sick before, so my mom take care of me, and my mom have language barrier, so they have some conflicts between themselves. I felt tired to be the middleman so I want to divorce.

除了溝通和生活之外，您還有什麼理由支持您提出離婚？

這兩點是我離婚的主要原因。

I have to admit I had some fights with my mother-in-law because his mother decided to stay with us, but I didn't want her mother to live with us. I respect my mother-in-law, but I know that Chinese people value their parents very much. As for the other question my wife mentioned just now, I was just showing my concern for him. She is actually physically and mentally unhealthy. Two doctors have diagnosed him with mental illness and depression.
我承認我前陣子確實和岳母有一些爭執，但我們會吵是因為他想要跟我們待再一起，但我先前沒有預想到全部的人會住在一起。我尊重我的岳母是因為我知道中國人都很尊重家庭，也很孝順。至於我會想了解說我太太去哪裡，我只是單純的關心她。她身心不太好，他有精神疾病，也會去看精神科。

你的意思是說你的生活出現問題是因為你的妻子有精神疾病吧？

一般來說，在正常的離婚案件中，在台灣人看來，我們希望勸說夫妻繼續在一起，而不是尋求離婚。雙方都想進行婚姻諮詢嗎？婚姻諮詢師的主要角色和職責是找出你婚姻中的問題。也許我們可以通過婚姻顧問來幫助您的婚姻。如果根本不工作，你已經盡力了，你會考慮嗎？
Generally Chinese or Taiwanese try to persuade couples to stay together in a relationship rather than seek a divorce in this kind of situation. Do both party consider for marriage consultant? The marriage counselor are responsiblele for find out the marital problems. Maybe the marriage counselor can help you maintain the marriage. If this didn;t work, at least you did your best.

我曾向丈夫建議過這種方法，但他沒有接受。他堅持認為婚姻是我們自己的事，我們沒有別人的幫助。既然他都這麼說了，我也無能為力。如果jhonor有能力說服他進行婚姻諮詢，我想嘗試一下。
I have suggest my husband for marriage counseling, but he didn’t take. He always insist that marriage is belong to couple, we don’t want ask other couple. Since he say no, I cannot force him. I hope the judge can suggest my husband to marriage counsel.

I don't mind if my wife wants a marriage counselor, but if we scold him for doing that, will my wife stop looking for her ex-boyfriend? That guy treated her badly, that guy was only interested in our money.

等等，你的意思是你妻子的婚姻有問題嗎？還有一個男朋友嗎？
Wait a minute, do you suspect she has a extra marital affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by introducing the concept of 'extra marital affair' which is not present in the original text.

Yes, that guy was his ex-boyfriend, and he kept seeing his ex-boyfriend even after we got married.
沒錯，那個友人就是他的前男友，甚至在我們結婚了他們還是有見面。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'guy' as '友人' which means 'friend' instead of '前男友' which means 'ex-boyfriend'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed '甚至' before '在我們結婚了' instead of after.

告訴人，您對此有何看法？
The expresser, what do you think?

這就是為什麼我說他對一切都持懷疑態度。他確實對一切都抱有很高的懷疑態度。他提到的男性朋友只是我最好的朋友之一。當一個人心情不好的時候，總是想和一些朋友聊聊，我也是。但我的丈夫總是把我和朋友的聊天當作家庭醜聞。他對我的朋友不友好。他不能，因為我有一個男性朋友然後認為我有婚外情。
This is why I mention my husband is highly suspicious of my ex boyfriend. He just mention that the male friend is just my good friend. When a person are in a bad mood, he or she would want to have a person to talk with, and I’m no acception. But my husband think that I talk with my friend is to show the family scandal. He treat my friends badly, but he cannot say that I have a extra marital affair with him.

我的意見是雙方都可以寫下自己對對方原來的看法。告訴人，你要知道，被告在國外有婚姻，在台灣，所以他可能為了你們的婚姻付出了很大的努力。你剛才說你和你丈夫的年齡差距很大，所以。你剛才提到你心情不好的時候總是和你的朋友聊天，我可以理解。這一部分我覺得你應該聽取意見，和你老公有個概念。
I suggest that both party can put down the stereotype. The expresser, you have to know that the other party leave his own country and come to here, so he may emphasize on this relationship, put more attention on this relationship. You mentioned that you have a gap in marriage, so you may know that when he has insecurity. I can understand that you wnat to talk with your friend when you are in a bad mood. However, you should get confirmation from your husband, or the situation will get worse.

是的我明白。
Yes, I understand.

被告，我知道你很愛你的妻子。但如果你愛一個人，就不要每天都懷疑她。就像她剛才說的，他出去的時候，你總是問他，問她很多問題，懷疑他有別的男朋友了。這種態度無法維持健康的婚姻。你必須明白，信任是婚姻的基礎。你必須明白它的重要性。
The other party, I know you still love your wife, but you cannot be high suspicious of him of her. He just mentioned that you may ask her many questions when she go out, and suspect of his male friends, so both of you cannot be happy in this marriage. You must know that confidence lay foundation of marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '信任是婚姻的基礎' (confidence is the foundation of marriage)

I get it, I'll give it a try.
我了解了，我會試著信任他。

看來雙方都不太願意進行婚姻諮詢，您將此案轉至婚姻諮詢中心看看我們是否能得到進一步的幫助。不得不提的是，因為你們都接受婚姻諮詢，所以你們必須一起去婚姻諮詢，否則這一切都是一句空話。我會給這個案例4個月左右的時間，看看你婚姻諮詢的效果。但我必須給你一個意見：婚姻根本不是一件容易的事。大家都知道，相聚容易，共處難。所以，如果你們已經結婚了，就繼續在一起吧。雙方都明白嗎？
Since both party are willing to have marriage counseling,  the case will transfer to the marriage counseling center, and see if they can solve this problem. Both the party accpet this method, so you have to go to marriage counsleing center together, otherwise the problem cannot be solved. And I will give this case for four months and see what’s the effect of marriage counsel. But I have to tell both party that marrigae is not easy, it’s not easy to maintain a marriage. Everyone knows taht it is easy to love each other, but it is hard to get along with each other. So since get marriage, you have to maintain this marriage. Do both party fully understand?

我和老公結婚3年了，但是年齡差距太大了，大約有30歲。以前我們談戀愛的時候，我不知道我們有很多價值觀不匹配，所以結婚後，我發現我一點也不幸福。我平時和老公溝通不好，而且他對一切都高度懷疑。他總是以關心的名義詢問我去了哪裡，遇見了誰。一開始我以為是他的關心，但隨著時間的推移，我覺得他越來越認真了。關於關心我。比如說，如果我告訴他我要去崇光百貨，但我帶著清風廣場的包回來後，他就會生氣，問很多關於我的事情。有時候，我不想解釋，但情況卻變得更糟。這種情況從我們結婚之初就開始了。我真的厭倦了這個。另外，我的丈夫是法國人，我的家人都不會說法語，所以我的家人都無法與他交談。雖然我不和家人住在一起，但每逢節假日或特殊場合，我們都會聚在一起。我病了好幾天，所以我媽媽來我家照顧我。由於語言障礙，我丈夫和我母親發生了很多衝突。我在他們之間做了很長一段時間的中間人，我覺得厭倦了，所以我想提出離婚。
I’ve been married with my husband for 3 years, but the gap of ages is too big, it’s about30 years. When we were in a relationship I didn’t realize or opinion has such a big gap and after marriage I think I felt unhappy. In most of the time we cannot communicate well and my husband is highly suspicious of me. He often asked me about where I’m going and who I’m going to meet in the name of care, in the name of being care. At the Beginning, I believe he’s he really cares about me. But as time goes on, his behavior is getting more and more serious. For instance, if I told him I was going to Sogo in Shihlin District, but when I come home I carry merchandise of breeze plaza, then he will ask for many things and sometimes he get angry. Sometimes, I don’t wat to explain, and the situations gets worse. Such a situation happened as soon as we get married. I’m very tired of it. Futher, my husband is French, my families don’t speak French. Therefore, they cannot communicate at all. Although I live apart from my families, but the holidays or special occasions, we’ll have to meet each other. In the previous period, I’m a little weak and a little sick so my mother come to my home took care of me. Because language barriers, my husband had serious conflicts with my mother. I play the middleman between them, and I feel really tired of it. Therefore, I want to divorce him.

The other party, what do you think about it?

I really like my wife, but I don't know why he wants to divorce. Don't the questions he just mentioned happen to every couple? They don't exactly want a divorce, do they?
我很愛我的妻子，我無法理解為甚麼他會覺得我們的婚姻有問題。他上述的問題不是每一對情侶都會遇到的問題嗎？他們沒有因此就想離婚，對吧？

當你的妻子談論生活形式時，你對生活形式有什麼看法？
However, focusing on the interaction problem your wife just mention, how do you think about it?

I have to admit I had some fights with my mother-in-law because his mother decided to stay with us, but I didn't want her mother to live with us. I respect my mother-in-law, but I know that Chinese people value their parents very much. As for the other question my wife mentioned just now, I was just showing my concern for him. She is actually physically and mentally unhealthy. Two doctors have diagnosed him with mental illness and depression.
我承認我前陣子和我的岳母有點衝突。原因只是因為他想跟我們住在一起，但是我還沒有習慣他在我們家。我很尊重我岳母，因為我知道家庭觀念對中國人是很重要的。至於，關於我太太剛才說的行蹤的問題，我只能說這就是我表達關心的方法。我太太的身心狀況其實沒有很好，他已經有因為憂鬱症及其他精神疾病去看過心理醫生了。

I love her very much and I don't mind her illness, in fact I would love to take care of her. I even found the best doctor in the spiritual field for him, I just want the best care for him. Finding him the best doctor near us and I only hope for the best for her.

一般來說，在正常的離婚案件中，在台灣人看來，我們希望勸說夫妻繼續在一起，而不是尋求離婚。雙方都想進行婚姻諮詢嗎？婚姻諮詢師的主要角色和職責是找出你婚姻中的問題。也許我們可以通過婚姻顧問來幫助您的婚姻。如果根本不工作，你已經盡力了，你會考慮嗎？
Well, generally, in the opinion of Chinese people and Taiwanese people, we always try to pursue couples to stay together in a relationship rather than seek a divorce.  Would the both parties consider a marriage counselor?I suggest so because the role and the drop of a marriage counselor is to help you communicate and getting along with each other. Perhaps you can get your marriage back by marriage counseling ing. Even if you failed, at least you had tried. Do you understand?

我曾向丈夫建議過這種方法，但他沒有接受。他堅持認為婚姻是我們自己的事，我們沒有別人的幫助。既然他都這麼說了，我也無能為力。如果jhonor有能力說服他進行婚姻諮詢，我想嘗試一下。
I once suggest so to my husband, but he didn’t agree. He always insist that marriage is our own business so we don’t want anyone to bother. Since he didn’t accept, I have nothing to do. But if the judge can pursue him to have a marriage counseling ing, of course I will accept.

等等，你的意思是你妻子的婚姻有問題嗎？還有一個男朋友嗎？
Hold on, you mean your wife has other boyfriend?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea of the wife having another boyfriend.

Yes, that guy was his ex-boyfriend, and he kept seeing his ex-boyfriend even after we got married.
沒錯，那個就是他的前男友，甚至在我們結婚後他們也一直見面。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'ex-boyfriend' as '前男友' which means 'former boyfriend' instead of '前男友' which means 'ex-boyfriend'.

您認為這種情況會導致您的婚姻出現問題嗎？

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I wouldn't say it was the main reason for our marital problems, but I would think it did affect how we viewed each other. I hope my wife won't meet that guy anymore.
我不會說這件事情造成我們婚姻的不快樂，他有一定的份量，至少他影響我們怎麼相處。我希望我的妻子可以向我保證他不會再見那個人。

告訴人，您對此有何看法？
The expresser, do you have anything to state about the issue?

這就是為什麼我說他對一切都持懷疑態度。他確實對一切都抱有很高的懷疑態度。他提到的男性朋友只是我最好的朋友之一。當一個人心情不好的時候，總是想和一些朋友聊聊，我也是。但我的丈夫總是把我和朋友的聊天當作家庭醜聞。他對我的朋友不友好。他不能，因為我有一個男性朋友然後認為我有婚外情。
This is why I say my husband is highly suspicious of me. The male friend he mentioned is simply a really good friend of me. If one is unhappy, he or she would want you to have a friend to talk about this, I’m no exception. However, my husband consider my talking to other people as I’m talking about the family scandal to others. He’s really unfriendly to my friends. However, he cannot consider me having an extra material affair simply because I’m meeting a male friend.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	consider me having an extra material affair

我的意見是雙方都可以寫下自己對對方原來的看法。告訴人，你要知道，被告在國外有婚姻，在台灣，所以他可能為了你們的婚姻付出了很大的努力。你剛才說你和你丈夫的年齡差距很大，所以。你剛才提到你心情不好的時候總是和你的朋友聊天，我可以理解。這一部分我覺得你應該聽取意見，和你老公有個概念。
My suggestion is can the both parties give up what you think about your partner for a while.The expresser, can you please understand the other party, your husband is a foreigner in this country, he has no family he is no friend. Therefore, he put all his time in this marriage in this in your relationship. As you mentioned, you are a old wife young wife. Therefore his sense of unsafe is understandable. You said that when you feel sad you need someone to talk about, to talk to, I can understand. However, should’t you get your husband’s understanding and consideration in this issue? Otherwise the misunderstanding will only expand.

是的我明白。
I get it.

被告，我知道你很愛你的妻子。但如果你愛一個人，就不要每天都懷疑她。就像她剛才說的，他出去的時候，你總是問他，問她很多問題，懷疑他有別的男朋友了。這種態度無法維持健康的婚姻。你必須明白，信任是婚姻的基礎。你必須明白它的重要性。
The other party, I know you love your wife every month still. However, if you really love someone, you shouldn’t be suspicious of her or him all the time. She said that whenever she goes out, you will ask a lot of questions, and you suspicious of having Alder boyfriend’s outside. How can such a situations such a condition remain your relationship? You should know that belief is the foundation of a marriage, please understand it.

I get it, I'll give it a try.
我明白了，我會試著做出改變的。

看來雙方都不太願意進行婚姻諮詢，您將此案轉至婚姻諮詢中心看看我們是否能得到進一步的幫助。不得不提的是，因為你們都接受婚姻諮詢，所以你們必須一起去婚姻諮詢，否則這一切都是一句空話。我會給這個案例4個月左右的時間，看看你婚姻諮詢的效果。但我必須給你一個意見：婚姻根本不是一件容易的事。大家都知道，相聚容易，共處難。所以，如果你們已經結婚了，就繼續在一起吧。雙方都明白嗎？
Since both parties agree on finding a marriage counselor, I will transfer this case to the marriage counseling center, perhaps they can help you keep this relationship. Please know that since the both party agree this temporary solution, you have to meet the marriage counselor together or this solution is simply a empty talk. And I will give for about 4 months to this case to see the result of your marriage counseling.  But I have to tell that both parties marriage is never an easy scene. Everyone knows it’s easy to fall in love but it’s difficult to last everyday. So since you’ve get marriage, please try to keep it. Can the both parties understand what I said?

我曾向丈夫建議過這種方法，但他沒有接受。他堅持認為婚姻是我們自己的事，我們沒有別人的幫助。既然他都這麼說了，我也無能為力。如果jhonor有能力說服他進行婚姻諮詢，我想嘗試一下。

Yes, that guy was his ex-boyfriend, and he kept seeing his ex-boyfriend even after we got married.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'ex-boyfriend' as '前男友' which means 'former boyfriend' instead of '前男友' which means 'ex-boyfriend'.

您認為這種情況會導致您的婚姻出現問題嗎？
Do you consider this situation that make your marital problem?

告訴人，您對此有何看法？
The expresser, what’s your opinios toward this distinct?

這就是為什麼我說他對一切都持懷疑態度。他確實對一切都抱有很高的懷疑態度。他提到的男性朋友只是我最好的朋友之一。當一個人心情不好的時候，總是想和一些朋友聊聊，我也是。但我的丈夫總是把我和朋友的聊天當作家庭醜聞。他對我的朋友不友好。他不能，因為我有一個男性朋友然後認為我有婚外情。
This is why I said about he’s suspicious about everything. He really have high suspicious about everything. The male friend he had mentioned is just one of my best friend. When someone is in the bad mood,  they always want to have a talking with some friends, so do I. But my husband always take my talking with my friend as a family scandal. He is not friendly toward my friends. He cannot because i have a male friend then think i have an extra marital affair.

我的意見是雙方都可以寫下自己對對方原來的看法。告訴人，你要知道，被告在國外有婚姻，在台灣，所以他可能為了你們的婚姻付出了很大的努力。你剛才說你和你丈夫的年齡差距很大，所以。你剛才提到你心情不好的時候總是和你的朋友聊天，我可以理解。這一部分我覺得你應該聽取意見，和你老公有個概念。
My opinion is can both party put down your original opinion toward eachother. The expresser, you must know that the respondent  have a marriage in other country, in Taiwan, so he may put a lot of effort on your marriage. You just said that your gap in age between you and your husband is large, so. You just mention that you always have a talking with your friend when you are in a bad mood, I can understand it. In this part, I think you should receive the opinions and have a concept with your husband.

是的我明白。
Yes, I understand.

被告，我知道你很愛你的妻子。但如果你愛一個人，就不要每天都懷疑她。就像她剛才說的，他出去的時候，你總是問他，問她很多問題，懷疑他有別的男朋友了。這種態度無法維持健康的婚姻。你必須明白，信任是婚姻的基礎。你必須明白它的重要性。
Respondent, I know you really love your wife. But if you love someone, do not be suspicious about her everyday. Just like she just said, when he went out, you always ask him, ask her a lot of problems, and suspicious him about having another boyfriend. This kind of attitude cannot maintain a healthy marriage. You must understand that trust is the basement of marriage. You must understand the important of it.

I get it, I'll give it a try.
我了解了，我會試著這麼做的。

看來雙方都不太願意進行婚姻諮詢，您將此案轉至婚姻諮詢中心看看我們是否能得到進一步的幫助。不得不提的是，因為你們都接受婚姻諮詢，所以你們必須一起去婚姻諮詢，否則這一切都是一句空話。我會給這個案例4個月左右的時間，看看你婚姻諮詢的效果。但我必須給你一個意見：婚姻根本不是一件容易的事。大家都知道，相聚容易，共處難。所以，如果你們已經結婚了，就繼續在一起吧。雙方都明白嗎？
It seems that both party are not, are willing to have a marriage counseling, you will transfer this case to the marriage counseling center to see if we can have the further help. You have to mention that because both of you accept the marriage counseling, so you have to go to the marriage counseling together, or all of this will be a empty talk. I will give this case for about 4 months to to see the effect of your marriage counseling.  But I have to give you an opinion is marriage is not easy at all. Everyone knows it’s easy to getting together but it’s difficult to live together. So if you had a marraige marriage, keep moving together. And the both party understand?

我和老公結婚3年了，但是年齡差距太大了，大約有30歲。以前我們談戀愛的時候，我不知道我們有很多價值觀不匹配，所以結婚後，我發現我一點也不幸福。我平時和老公溝通不好，而且他對一切都高度懷疑。他總是以關心的名義詢問我去了哪裡，遇見了誰。一開始我以為是他的關心，但隨著時間的推移，我覺得他越來越認真了。關於關心我。比如說，如果我告訴他我要去崇光百貨，但我帶著清風廣場的包回來後，他就會生氣，問很多關於我的事情。有時候，我不想解釋，但情況卻變得更糟。這種情況從我們結婚之初就開始了。我真的厭倦了這個。另外，我的丈夫是法國人，我的家人都不會說法語，所以我的家人都無法與他交談。雖然我不和家人住在一起，但每逢節假日或特殊場合，我們都會聚在一起。我病了好幾天，所以我媽媽來我家照顧我。由於語言障礙，我丈夫和我母親發生了很多衝突。我在他們之間做了很長一段時間的中間人，我覺得厭倦了，所以我想提出離婚。
I’ve had a marriage with my husband for about three years; however, the gap of age of us is too huge, it’s 30 years old. When we were having a dating and a relationship, pur concept are matched; however, after marriage, I’m not happy. In many time, I have a difficulty talking to my husband. Also, my husband is highly suspicious to everything. He usually care about asking who I will meet and the place I will go in the name of caring about me. Firstly, i think he just care about me, but afterwe date, I think he got more and more serious about it. For example, if I said I want to go to sogo in Shihlin district; however, when I came back and the bag is not from sogo,instead, the bag is from breeze plaza, my husband will ask me everything then he will turn very angry. Sometimes, if I don’t want to explain, the situation will get worse. This situation happen just in the beginning in our marriage, I feel so tired, really tired. Moreover, my husband is a French; however, in my family, no one can speaking France. Currently, I live out of the family; however, on holidays or special occasions, I will live together with my family. Some days before, I’m a little sick, my mother came to my house to take care of me. However, because of the language barrier, my husband have conflicts with my mom. Being the middleman, I was so tired, so i want to file for a divorce.

If you don’t tell your husband to let him understand your behavior, the problem will be bigger and bigger to fully understand.

是的我明白。

被告，我知道你很愛你的妻子。但如果你愛一個人，就不要每天都懷疑她。就像她剛才說的，他出去的時候，你總是問他，問她很多問題，懷疑他有別的男朋友了。這種態度無法維持健康的婚姻。你必須明白，信任是婚姻的基礎。你必須明白它的重要性。
Respondent, I cam exactly know your feelings that you love her, but you can;t just be highly suspicious of everything just because your love. Just like what she mentioned, when she want to go out, you just ask many many questions. Do your think this could make your marriage better? Isn’t it right? You have to know that marriage is based on trust between two parties.

I get it, I'll give it a try.
我理解了，我會試試看。

看來雙方都不太願意進行婚姻諮詢，您將此案轉至婚姻諮詢中心看看我們是否能得到進一步的幫助。不得不提的是，因為你們都接受婚姻諮詢，所以你們必須一起去婚姻諮詢，否則這一切都是一句空話。我會給這個案例4個月左右的時間，看看你婚姻諮詢的效果。但我必須給你一個意見：婚姻根本不是一件容易的事。大家都知道，相聚容易，共處難。所以，如果你們已經結婚了，就繼續在一起吧。雙方都明白嗎？
Now that you can accept marriage counseling, so I will allow this case to the marriage counseling center. Maybe the marriage counselor can help you about this. But you have to know that this is a solution to your problem, but you have to go to the marriage couseling together. Otherwise, this will just be useless. I want you to go to marriage for 4 months, and after that, I will evaluate the solution. However, take my advise, marriage is not that easy. Everyone knows that falling in love with others is easy, but how to get along with others is difficult. Now you just married, just go to long, please. Do you really understand this?
