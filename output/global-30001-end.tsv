請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any evidence you need to investigate or any witness to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena Cai Yan Wang, who is still working at the Bo Yuan cram school, as a witness. We want her to explain the reason why she texted those messages, and explain the relationship between she and the defendant.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical details of the content of the text messages and the background and purpose of their writing.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' before the object 'Cai Yan Wang', resulting in incorrect word order.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after the introductory phrase 'I would like to'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there any evidence you want the court to investing for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'investing' instead of 'investigate'.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
 I heard that the cram school has do some action because of their relationship. And there even someone was trying to persuade Cai Yan Wang to leave the cram school. Is it possible to verify the truth?

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there any evidence you want to court to investigate for you? The situation is your program was ended on December fifteenth, 2012. There is still no reason for you to keep texting messages with Cai Yan Wang for helping the homework. Especially, most of your messages are after nine o’clock, it is very suspicious. Do you have any evidence to prove your innocence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'your program was ended on December fifteenth, 2012' is incorrect. It should be 'your program ended on December fifteenth, 2012'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of '希望法庭為你調查的事證' as 'evidence you want the court to investigate for you' is incorrect. It should be 'evidence you hope the court to investigate for you'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant's master's degree and the date it ended, which is important context for the argument.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我現在想不到有任何證據可以提供給法院來證明我的行為。我說過了，我和我同事間的簡訊互動是非常平常。我只是想要繼續學中文，並且增進我的中文能力。

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the next court will be at four o’clock p.m., on July ninth, 2014. The main purpose of the court is to examine the witness’s statements. Plaintiff and defendant please show up on that day. If necessary both of you can have your lawyers. Do you understand?

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are going to discuss the adultery case. The plaintiff filed this case. The reason is that the plaintiff’s husband had the intimate messages with colleague in the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate massages in her husband’s phone. Moreover, her husband often made up reasons for additional working in the cram school, and sometimes in the in the night………The plaintiff found the content in the messages and the behavior between them is beyond co-worker’s relationship.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry in Taiwan? Or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I acquainted with my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is also from Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'acquainted' before the subject 'I', which is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So I the past years, your husband’s job is teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be 'was' to match the past tense of the original text.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we know each other at the very first time, he is a teacher who teaching Portuguese. After we married, he still teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hour is not very regular. Sometimes, there….will….are 1or2 months between jobs. to make the income more regularly, he changes to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he seeks an advanced degree.

omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	Incorporating the word 'to' in the sentence 'to make the income more regularly' is unnecessary.

omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	Inserting the phrase 'he seeks an advanced degree' is not present in the original text.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
As you said, he want to seek a advanced degree. Is it mean he want to get the degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek a advanced degree' instead of 'further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he want to teach in Taiwan, he wants to get the English teaching degree. And he found a distance learning program on the internet which is from the California. This program enable him to not to go to the America and still can get the learning program from distance learning. And after he…complete this program, he can get the degree. His plan is after he get the degree from the program, he can teach English in Taiwan.
