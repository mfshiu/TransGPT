Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The incident happened on May 22nd, 2014, and the defendant, Mr. Anderson, took the umbrella of Ms.陳小倩, and the incident happened in Yingge Ceramics Museum.

Please explain regarding my questions to help the prosecutor what happened on that day. Do you understand? And later, we will ask the plaintiff about what happened on that day. Do you understand the procedure?

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
And first, the defendant, where were you at 4:15 in the afternoon on May 27th, 2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen, on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see Ms. Chen, the plaintiff, on that day?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，我把傘放回傘架時，有看到陳小姐。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我看到陳小姐' instead of '有看到陳小姐'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
 And what happened then on that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'What happened then on that time?'

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大叫，說我偷了她的雨傘。我想要告訴她，我只是拿到錯的傘。我並沒有想要偷她的傘，我想要解釋，但她根本不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我只是拿到錯的傘' is incorrect. It should be '我只是拿錯了傘'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Ms. Chen think that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟同學一起去博物館看一個展覽。當我們看完展覽，有兩位同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定去外面買東西吃，也許是在外面找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，外面正在下雨。我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟同學借一把傘。因為我有點高，又有點壯，就決定跟我ㄧ個同學Adam借把傘。他的體型跟我差不多。所以我從傘架中拿了一把傘。我跟我的老師，還有幾位同學一起去買麵包。我們回來的時候，陳小姐就看到我，並對我大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '所以我們決定去外面買東西吃' is incorrect. It should be '所以我們決定去外面吃東西'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '看' in the sentence '那天我跟同學一起去博物館看一個展覽' should agree with the subject '我們', so it should be '看了' instead of '看'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '回來' in the sentence '我們回來的時候' should be in the past tense, so it should be '回來了' instead of '回來'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun '我' in the sentence '所以我們決定去外面買東西吃' should be '我們' to match the plural subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the classmates were hungry, which is mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the user planned to borrow an umbrella from their classmates.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the user went to buy bread with their professor and two other friends.
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	The user's translation does not convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness in the sentence '陳小姐就看到我，並對我大叫'. It should be '陳小姐就看到我，並對我大聲喊叫' to reflect the appropriate level of politeness.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed was actually Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '同學' as 'actually'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我以為那把傘是亞當的，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為那把傘是亞當的' instead of '我以為那把傘是亞當的'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
 Do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you took on that day?

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得那把傘的顏色，是藍色的，而且不是全新的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '不是全新的' (not a brand new one) before the color '藍色的' (blue), which is the incorrect word order.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the entire umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的印象中，是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anyone who prove what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，我出博物館的時候，我是跟老師還有兩位同學一起的。我的老師也有提議要借我的傘，因為她的傘有點小，我並沒有拿。我不想要她被淋濕，然後也有兩位同學在旁邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我是跟老師還有兩位同學一起的" is incorrect. It should be "我跟老師還有兩位同學一起出博物館的時候".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "然後也有兩位同學在旁邊" is incorrect. It should be "然後旁邊也有兩位同學".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the professor offered to lend their umbrella.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the reason why the user didn't take the professor's umbrella (to prevent the professor from getting wet).

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Therefore, perhaps, the professor and those two classmates can come to the court to verify what you said is true.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
也許是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any other evidence that you would like to ask the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想要把傘還給陳小姐，但她不想拿；我也試圖想要道歉，但她根本不聽。我的老師跟同學也許可以證實，我說的是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也試圖想要道歉' is incorrect. It should be '我也試圖想要道歉'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '拿' should agree with the subject '她', so it should be '她不想拿'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '證實' should be in the future tense to match the context, so it should be '也許可以證實'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK. Now, I would like to ask Ms. Chen about the detail of the incident on that day.Ms. Chen, could you please elaborate what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day, and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. However, when I came out form the museum, I found that my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff in the museum to help me find the umbrella, but I later saw putting my umbrella back. When I found that the umbrella he took was actually mine, I was actually very angry, and I asked him why he had taken my umbrella. It was raining at that time. How could he do that?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'I was actually very angry' instead of 'I was very angry'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '鶯歌博物館' as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' instead of 'Yingge Museum'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外國人' as 'foreigner' instead of 'this foreigner'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊的傘' as 'my umbrella' instead of 'the umbrella that was stolen'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '沒有公德心' as 'do that' instead of 'lack of civic-mindedness'.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What color was the umbrella you took on that day, and is there any feature of the umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I took on that day should have been blue, dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please show page five on the file one. Is that the umbrella belonging to you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'photo' in the translation, which is an important detail.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'please' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'show'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'belonging' instead of 'is it yours', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is mine.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this photo is common, and people can buy such an umbrella even at a 7-11. How could you verify that is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Actually, I did buy my umbrella at a 7-11. However, the button on my umbrella is a little broken; therefore, it is hard to buckle it up. In terms of this, I have especially talked about it when I made my record at the police station. And the umbrella, which the foreigner put back to the umbrella rack, also had this feature; therefore, it can be proven that the umbrella is mine.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'In terms of this, I have especially talked about it when I made my record at the police station.' The correct word order should be: 'I have especially talked about this when I made my record at the police station.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And the umbrella, which the foreigner put back to the umbrella rack, also had this feature; therefore, it can be proven that the umbrella is mine.' The correct word order should be: 'And the umbrella, which the foreigner put back on the umbrella rack, also had this feature; therefore, it can be proven that the umbrella is mine.'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant regrets and he is willing to apologize, would you like to forgive him? After all, what you missed was an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
It is not about what I missed was an umbrella. It is about one’s personality. If he had not taken the umbrella back on that day, I would be totally wet when I got home on that day. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
 Yes, I understand. And the court will subpoena those three witnesses to the court to testimony what happened on that day. The next court date is set on June 19th, 2014. Is that okay for you on that day, the defendant?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會到庭。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Ms. Chen, you can decide whether to come on the next court date. On the next court date, we will mainly ask the professor and the two fellows on that day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant and the purpose of questioning the classmates and teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'on the next court date' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'come'.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
It doesn’t matter; otherwise, I have to take a leave from my job.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'otherwise' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand, and today’s court is dismissed. And the two parties sign on today’s records, and you may leave.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the instruction for the interpreter to leave after signing the records.

對我覺得那是我同學亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我覺得那是我同學亞當的傘'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
do you remember what’s the shape and color of the umbrella you took on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you remember what the shape and color of the umbrella you took on that day were?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，印象中是藍色的，不是很新
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the item not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
so was the whole umbrella in blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
我印象中是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'blue' as '藍色' which means 'blue color' instead of simply '藍' which means 'blue'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
can anyone verify what you just said?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
對當時我走出博物館的時候，我的兩個同學還有老師都和我在一起。我老師甚至還想要借我雨傘，因為他的傘太小了所以我沒有跟他拿，我不想他被淋濕，還有其他兩位同學在場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '對當時我走出博物館的時候' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當時我走出博物館的時候'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '因為他的傘太小了所以我沒有跟他拿'. The correct form should be '因為他的傘太小了所以我沒有拿'.

semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the detail that the professor's umbrella was small. The correct translation should include this detail.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
These three people can manage to come to the court right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
do you have any further evidence that want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'court' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著想要把傘還給陳小姐，但他不願意；我試著要跟他到道歉，他也不接受。也許我的老師和同學可以證明我所言屬實。

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
 Okay, now I’m going to inquire Mr. Chen what happened on that day. Ms. Chen, can you state what happened on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Ms. Chen, can you state what happened on that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
When I went to the Yingge ceramics museum, it’s raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack. But when I got out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff in the museum to look for my umbrella for me but then I saw that foreigner put my umbrella back. When I found what’s on his hand was my umbrella I was so angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it’s raining outside? How could someone be so…
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part where they asked the museum staff to help them find their umbrella.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'it's' instead of 'it was' to describe the weather.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
what’s the color of the umbrella you brought on that day? Did it have any feature on it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color is the umbrella you brought on that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
 The umbrella I brought that day was blue. I guess navy blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色' as 'navy blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please show the investigatory record on page five. Is the umbrella on the picture yours?

對，就是這把傘。
yes, it was this one.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
the umbrella on the picture was quite normal like the ones you can find in 7-11. How could you be sure that this one belongs to you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的那種' as 'quite normal' instead of 'ordinary type'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, indeed. I bought this umbrella in 7-11. But my umbrella was broken a little bit at the place to close the umbrella. According to this point, I did explain to the police station about the button on the umbrella. The umbrella that the foreigner returned had the same characteristics as the one I had.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'According to this point, I did explain to the police station about the button on the umbrella.' The correct word order should be: 'I did explain to the police station about the button on the umbrella, according to this point.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the umbrella was bought at 7-11. The correct translation should include this detail.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Will you consider to accept the defendant’s apology if he’s willing to apologize to you? After all, it’s only an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
what do you mean “only” an umbrella? It’s something related to one’s basic ethics. If he didn’t return the umbrella on that day, he wants me to walk back in the pouring rain? I don’t want to accept his apology.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'only' instead of 'related to' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'he wants' instead of 'he wants me' which results in a subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'on that day' which is an important detail in the sentence.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The next court day is set at 3pm on June 19th in 2014' is incorrect. It should be 'The next court day is set for 3pm on June 19th, 2014.'

Yes, I will be here.
是，我可以到場
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The plaintiff Ms. Chen, next court you can choose to come or not. Basically we just want to the defendant’s professor and his classmates. You can decide whether you want to come or not.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Basically, we just want the defendant's professor and his classmates.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff's classmates and only mentioned the defendant's professor. The correct translation should include both the classmates and the professor.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
Well, I don’t think so. I don’t want to ask for extra day off.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about needing to ask for leave.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
On May twenty seventh, 2013, Mr. Anderson took Chen Xiao Qian’s umbrella in the Yingge ceramic museum. This incident happened when it is not informed Xiao Qian Chen. When  you tried to returned the umbrella, you were caught by Xiao Qian Chen. Therefore, she filed the case. Today procedure is to investigate what happened that day. Please answer my questions to help the court understand what happened that day.And after that, we’ll ask plaintiff what was happening on that day,do both party understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (took Chen Xiao Qian’s umbrella) should be translated as 借了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (borrowed Chen Xiao Qian’s umbrella)

I understand.
是,我了解

我了解。
Yes I understand

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
So defendant, what are you doing on 4:15 pm, May twenty seven, 2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我那時是在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see plaintiff xiao qian Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see Xiao Qian Chen, the plaintiff?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
對，當我把傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐在那邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐在那邊，當我把傘放回傘架的時候。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對我大吼，然後說我偷了他的雨傘。我試著跟他解釋說，我一定是不小心拿錯的。我並沒有去偷他的傘，我嘗試跟他解釋，但他不肯聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '他對我大吼' is incorrect. It should be '他大吼對我'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' should be translated as 'she' instead of 'he' since the original text refers to a female.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'saying that' which is important for conveying the meaning that she yelled at the speaker.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'I tried to apologize to her' which is important for understanding the speaker's actions.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'but she wouldn’t listen' which is important for understanding the speaker's frustration.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
So why Miss Chen said you steal her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'asked'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館參觀一個展覽。到我們結束參觀的時候，我的兩個同學說他們餓了。所以我們就到外面找食物吃，然後順便找找哪裡可以吃晚餐。當我在博物館裡的時候，我就發現外面正在下大雨了。因為我沒有帶傘，所以我就跟我同學借一把傘。因為我身形有點大，所以我決定從我朋友艾登那邊借了一支傘。他的身形跟我比較像。所以我就從傘架拿走一隻傘。然後我就去買一些麵包給我的教授和我的朋友。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我們大吼。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean that the umbrella you borrowed belong to your friend, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '當時借的傘' as 'the umbrella you borrowed' instead of 'the umbrella you borrowed at that time'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我那個時候是拿艾登的傘，我並沒有意圖想拿別人的傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'Adam' was translated as '艾登' instead of '亞當', resulting in a mismatched meaning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我拿的傘' instead of '我那個時候是拿'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
So do you remember what kind of umbrella you took that day?the color and the shape?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我記得那個顏色，那個顏色是藍色的，而且整支傘看起來沒有很新。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'not a brand new one' as '整支傘看起來沒有很新', which means 'the whole umbrella doesn't look new', but the original text only mentions that it was not brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Was the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
如果我沒記錯的話，那應該整支都是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the entire object was blue, while the original text only mentions the color.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone proved what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'proved' is incorrect, it should be 'prove'.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
對，當我從博物館出來的時候，我的教授和我另外兩個同學可以幫我作證。我的教授甚至要借我他的雨傘。因為他的雨傘有點小，所以我沒有跟他借。我不想要讓他淋濕，況且其他兩個同學都在。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of pronouns
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of professor's gender

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So all of them can come to the court and verified what you said, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著嘗試跟陳小姐解釋說我沒有要偷傘，但是他不肯聽。我也試著跟他道歉但他就是不肯接收。或許我的教授和我兩個同學可以證實我講的話是真的。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	陳小姐 should be translated as Ms. Chen instead of 陳小姐
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 我試著嘗試跟陳小姐解釋說 should be rearranged to 我試著跟陳小姐解釋說
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Ok now I am going to questioning Miss Chen what happened that day.Miss Chen, can you elaborate what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Miss Chen, can you elaborate on what happened that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge ceramic museum that day.When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack.But when I came out, I found my umbrella was disappeared. I asked for the staffs in the museum to help me to find my umbrella.But when I came out the museum, I found a foreigner took my umbrella, and umbrella was in his hand. When I found that my umbrella was taken by that foreigner, I was very angry. So I yelled him, asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t him know that it was raining out there? How can……..

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '質問' as 'yelled' instead of 'asked'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '公德心' as 'politeness' instead of 'public morality'.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Can you tell me what kind of umbrella you brought that day? Is there any feature?Like shape and color?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella you brought that day?'
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the question about the features of the umbrella.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I took that day was blue, deep blue one.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'deep blue one', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '深藍色的' as 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please see the investigate file, is that umbrella in the picture belongs to you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the page number and the fact that it is a photo.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'belongs' instead of 'belong'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
Actually,this kind of umbrella is quite common,you can be bought this kind of umbrella in many convenient stores like 7-11.How can you proved that it is belong to you?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user added unnecessary content by mentioning the availability of the umbrella in 7-11 stores.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I bought that umbrella in a 7-11. But there is a little problem on the button of the umbrella, so it can not be locked. At this point, when I filed the case to police,I have explain for them. The umbrella that foreigner put back have the same feature. So I pretty sure that it was my umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the damage to the button of the umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase 'when I filed the case to police,I have explain for them.' The correct word order should be 'when I filed the case to the police, I explained it to them.'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If defendant apologize,and want to reconcile…settle…..with him..
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the stolen umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'settle' before the subject 'defendant', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important details of the defendant expressing remorse and willingness to apologize.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it just an umbrella? It’s not only about an umbrella, it’s about…If him didn’t put back the umbrella, I may have to go back home without umbrella, and it’s raining. I don’t want to forgive hime.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '只是一把傘' is translated as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'it's not only about an umbrella'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error. 'If him didn’t put back the umbrella' should be 'If he didn't put back the umbrella'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the speaker may have to go back home without an umbrella if it is not returned.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Okay, I understand. So we will subpoena all of the three witness and defendant to the court.The next court will be on 3 pm, June nineteenth, 2014.All of the witness and defendant should have to come to the court. Do you understand, defendant?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'All of the witness and defendant should have to come to the court.' It should be 'All of the witnesses and the defendant should have to come to the court.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence 'The next court will be on 3 pm, June nineteenth, 2014.' It should be 'The next court will be at 3 pm on June nineteenth, 2014.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of sending subpoenas to the three individuals mentioned by the defendant.

Yes, I will be here.
是，我會準時到場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiss, Ms. Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see Ms. Chen, the plaintiff?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有,當我把散放回去的時候,他在那邊

What happened then?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對我大吼大叫說我偷他的傘,我試著跟她說我拿錯了 我並沒有偷傘 我試著跟他道歉 但是她不肯聽

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'would' instead of 'did' in the question.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟我朋友去那邊看展,當我們看完的時候 我兩個同學說他們餓了 所以我們就決定去買點東西吃 找地方吃晚餐 當我離開博物館的時候 發現外面下雨了 我沒有帶傘 所以我就打算跟我朋友亞當借傘 我身形比較巨大 他的身形跟我的比較像 所以我打算跟他借傘 我跟我教授還有兩個同學去買麵包 我們回來的時候 陳小姐就開始對我大吼
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'exhibition' is translated as '那邊看展', which does not accurately convey the meaning of visiting a museum for an exhibition.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean the umbrella you borrow was your friend, Adam’s umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning by using 'borrow' instead of 'lend'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對 我以為那是亞當的傘 我並沒有想偷傘
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為那是亞當的傘' instead of '對 我以為那是亞當的傘'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the umbrella you took that day, what’s the color and shape?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you remember what color and shape the umbrella you took that day was?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色 是藍色的 傘不新

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
The whole umbrella was blue?

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有 我是跟我教授還有兩個同學一起去出博物館的 我的教授甚至說要借我傘 但是因為他的傘很小 我就沒有跟她借 我不想讓她淋濕 還有其他兩個同學也在那

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three people you mentioned can come to the court to verify your words, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I guess so.
我想應該可以

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著要把傘回給她 但是她不拿  我試著跟他道歉 她也不聽 我想我的教授跟兩個同學可以證明我說的是真的
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我試著跟他道歉' should be '我試著跟她道歉'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Incorrect pronoun usage in the sentence '我想我的教授跟兩個同學可以證明我說的是真的' should be '我想我的教授和我的朋友們可以證明我今天所說的是真的'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Okay, now I am going to ask Ms. Chen the situation that day.  Ms. Chen, can you tell me what happened that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yinge ceramics museum that day, and it was raining. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack out there. When I came out, my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff of the museum to find the umbrella for me, and then I found out that the foreigner took my umbrella. When I found out that the umbrella he took was my missing one, I was really angry and inquired him for the reason. Didn’t he know it was raining out there? How could he do that?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out critical context

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Can you tell me what’s the color of the umbrella you took that day? Is there any characteristic?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought was blue, I think it’s dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the investigatory evidence of page five. Can you tell me the umbrella in the picture, is that yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it’s mine.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is a really normal one, which you can buy at 7-11 everywhere. How can you be sure that was yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '那種' as 'everywhere' instead of 'that kind'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought that umbrella at 7-11. But the button of my umbrella was a little bit broken, so it couldn’t be buckled up. I explained this to the police when I called them. The one the foreigner put back had the same situation, from this, I could tell that was my umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they explained the broken button to the police when they reported the case.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If he is regretful and willing to apologize, is it possible that you could forgive him? After all, it’s just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by “just an umbrella?” it’s about a person’s virtue. If he didn’t take back that day, didn’t I have to go home in the rain? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'just a matter of an umbrella.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'If he didn't return it that day, do I have to go home in the rain?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the person not returning the umbrella, which is important for understanding the context.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. Then we will subpoena the three people the defendant mentioned and ask them to tell the situation that day. The next court date is at 3 pm on June 19th in 2014, and the defendant and the three witnesses have to come to the court. Defendant, is the time okay for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I will be here.
是的我會到
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Ms. Chen, you can choose to attend the next court or not. Basically we are going to inquiry some questions to the defendant’s classmates and professor. But if you want to come, it’s okay.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the plaintiff is being addressed.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'inquiry' instead of 'ask' or 'question'.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, I would have to take a day off.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. Then today’s court ends here. Please sign on the record before you leave.

So they three can prove that what you just told is true, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'can' should agree with the plural subject 'they'.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
 Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
 我試著想把傘還給陳小姐但她不拿 我也試著想要道歉但她也不接受 或許我的教授和同學能證明我剛剛說的都是真的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著想把傘還給陳小姐" is incorrect. It should be "我試著想把傘還給陳小姐".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我也試著想要道歉但她也不接受" is incorrect. It should be "我也試著想要道歉但她也不接受".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
 Okay, now I’m going to ask Miss Chen what happened that day. Miss Chen, can you tell me what happened that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and it was raining. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella into the umbrella rack. When I was out, I noticed that my umbrella was gone. I ask the museum to help me find my umbrella then I saw the foreigner put my umbrella back. It was the umbrella I lost. I was so angry that I ask him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he notice that was raining outside? Why he was so lack of morality?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they asked the museum staff for help in finding their umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '鶯歌博物館' as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' instead of 'Yingge Museum'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'I ask' instead of 'I asked' to indicate past tense.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The user used 'he' instead of 'they' to refer to the foreigner.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user did not mention the specific cultural reference of '鶯歌' (Yingge), which is a famous ceramics town in Taiwan.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Can you tell me what color you brought that day? Any specific charateristics?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella you brought that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought was blue, deep blue, I think.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'deep blue, I think', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '應該是深藍色的' (should be deep blue).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
The evidence one, picture on page five. Is that your umbrella in the picture?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '提示偵卷' as 'evidence one' instead of 'examination paper'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'Is' before the subject 'that your umbrella'. The correct word order should be 'Is that your umbrella'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is mine.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
 The umbrella in the picture is common in 7-11. Why can you sure that was your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought my umbrella at 7-11. But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella. Also I told the police as the explanation. The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I was sure that was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella.' The correct word order should be 'But there is some damage/breakage at the button, so I can recognize that it was my umbrella.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I was sure that was my umbrella.' The correct form should be 'The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I am/was sure that it was my umbrella.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Incorrect word choice in the sentence: 'But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella.' The correct word should be 'damage' or 'breakage' instead of 'broke' to convey the intended meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence: 'But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella.' The user did not mention the specific details of the damage or breakage on the button of the umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence: 'Also I told the police as the explanation.' The user did not mention what explanation they provided to the police.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence: 'The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I was sure that was my umbrella.' The user did not mention what specific feature they were referring to.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
So can you tell me if he is regret and willing to apologize, is there any possible to forgive him? Because it is just an umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is there any possible to forgive him?' instead of 'Can you tell me if he is regret and willing to apologize, is there any possible to forgive him?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks if the speaker would be able to forgive the person if they show regret and are willing to apologize, while the user's translation asks if the speaker is able to forgive the person because it is just an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
 What do you mean “it is just an umbrella?” It is about morality issue. If he didn’t put back the umbrella, should I have to get wet home? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just' instead of 'mean' or 'about'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'should' instead of 'have to' in the conditional sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '一把傘' in the translation.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
 Okay, I understand. We will subpoena to the three people that defendant just mentioned to clarify what defendant said is true or not. The next court date will be set at 3 PM, June 19th, 2014. Defendant and the other three people should show up. Defendant, is that fine with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Defendant and the other three people should show up.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of sending subpoenas to the three individuals.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the purpose of the court appearance, which is to explain the events of the day in question.

Defendant, at 4:15 p.m. on May 27th 2014, where was you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'Where were you?' instead of 'Where was you?'

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see Miss Chen?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有阿，當我把傘放回傘價的時候。她就在那了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我把傘放回傘架的時候'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the specific time frame mentioned in the original text.

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對我大叫說我偷了他的傘。我試著要告訴他我拿錯把了，我沒有偷他的傘。可是他根本不聽我說。

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of the speaker trying to apologize to the person.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why Miss Chen still insist that you steal her umbrella?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'still' before 'Miss Chen' instead of after
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'insist' in the translation

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟我跟我同學去博物館看展覽。當我們看完的時候，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定去外面找地方吃東西。可是當我們要離開的時候，外面在下雨。我沒有帶傘，所以想跟我同學借把傘。但是我很高又很壯，我決定跟我朋友亞當借傘。她的身形跟我很像。所以我從傘架上拿了他的傘。我跟教授一起去買一些麵包。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大吼大叫。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using '她' (she) instead of '他' (he) to refer to Adam
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	using '我跟我' (I and I) instead of '我和我的' (my classmates and I)

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed on that day is Adan’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '亞當' as 'Adan' instead of 'Adam'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對阿，那把傘是亞當的。我根本沒有想要偷別人的傘。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'belonged' should agree with the subject 'umbrella', so it should be 'belonged' instead of 'belong'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember the umbrella’s color and type?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，是藍色的而且不是很新的傘。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of an umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjective '藍色的' (blue) before the noun '傘' (umbrella), which is the opposite of the correct word order in Chinese.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Was the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我認知裡面，它是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'recollection' is translated as '認知' which means 'cognition' or 'perception' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory' or 'remembrance'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anyone can prove that you are innocent?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有阿，當我到博物館時，我的兩個同學跟教授都跟我在一起。我教授甚至要借我他的傘，但是因為它的傘太小了，我就沒拿了。我不想要教授淋濕。我其他兩個同學也在那。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "有阿，當我到博物館時" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "當我到博物館時，有阿".

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I guess so.
應該是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著想要把傘環給陳小姐。可是他不接受，我想跟他道歉，它也不聽。我的兩個朋友跟教授可以證明我說的話是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我試著想要把傘環給陳小姐'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'today' in the sentence '我的兩個朋友跟教授可以證明我說的話是真的'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Now I am going to ask Miss Chen some details of that day. Miss Chen, can you deliberate what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
when I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum, it was raining. I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack when I went into the museum.

I was so angry and I ask him why he took my umbrella? Didn’t you know there is raining outside?............
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part where the umbrella was found and returned by the foreigner.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'gave' instead of 'took' in the sentence 'and then I saw the foreigner gave the umbrella back to the rack.'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What’s the color of the umbrella which you brought at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check page5. Is the umbrella on the pictures yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on that picture is common which you can buy in any convenient store. How can you make sure that it is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
I bought the umbrella in convenient store. But the button on the umbrella is broken, and it can’t buckle up. I have told the detail to the police when I sue the case. The umbrella the foreigner gave back has the same character. It is my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'I have told the detail to the police when I sue the case.' It should be 'I have told the police the detail when I sued the case.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'sue the case' is not appropriate in this context. It should be 'report the case' or 'file a complaint'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the umbrella being bought at 7-11, which is an important detail in the original text.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it is just an umbrella? …………………………………. If he didn’t give back the umbrella to me, did he want me to go home when it’s raining?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '只是一把傘' is translated as 'it is just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean that it is just an umbrella?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The phrase 'did he want me to go home when it’s raining?' should be 'did he want me to go home when it’s raining?'

Ok, first, defendant, where are you at four fifteen p.m. May 27th, 2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the defendant, Miss Chen, at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有，當我把傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐就在那。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐就在那，當我把傘放回傘架的時候。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
So what happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對著我大喊，說我偷了她的雨傘。我試著跟她講說我只是拿錯了，我沒有偷她的傘，我試著跟她解釋，但她卻不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著跟她講說我只是拿錯了' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試著跟她說我只是拿錯了'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
But why Ms.Chen said that you steal her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'say'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Ms. Chen' after the verb 'said' instead of before
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'that' before 'you steal her umbrella'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我和一些同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看一個展覽。我們看完展後，兩個同學說他們肚子很餓。所以我們決定出去走走並且吃飯，再找找可以吃晚餐的地方。當我要離開博物館時，我發現在下雨了。我沒有帶傘所以我想要和我同學借傘。因為我比較高也比較壯，所以我決定要和我的同學艾登借傘，因為他的體型和我比較類似。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，然後和我的教授和同學去買麵包。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就對著我們大喊了。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean the umbrella that you borrow is your friend, Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '同學' as 'friend' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對啊，我以為我拿的傘是艾登的，我沒有要偷別人的傘的意思。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember what color is the umbrella you took on that day? Or what kind of shape it is?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色是藍色的，而且樣式也比較舊。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the style of the item being described.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
So the whole umbrella is blue in your memory?

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我記憶中，的確是藍色的。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anybody prove what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有啊，當我回到博物館時，我的教授和同學都跟我在一起，我的教授甚至提議說要借她的雨傘給我，但是因為她的傘比較小，所以我就沒有跟她借，我不想讓她淋濕，而另外兩個同學也是一樣的情況。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '有啊' should be '啊有'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three people can come to the court and prove what you said, can they?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想應該可以吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
So is there any evidence you want the court to help you investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想把傘還給陳小姐，但她不想拿，我也試著跟她解釋，但是她不想聽，也許我的教授和同學都能來這幫我作證，證明我說的話是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也試著跟她解釋' is incorrect. It should be '我也試著跟她解釋'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement in the sentence '但是她不想聽' is incorrect. It should be '但是她不想聽我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'return' in the sentence '我想把傘還給陳小姐'. It should be '我想把傘還給陳小姐'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'today' in the sentence '證明我說的話是真的'. It should be '證明我說的話是真的'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK, now I want to ask some questions about what happen on that day to Ms.Chen. Ms.Chen, can you explain what happen on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to ceramics museum in Ying ge and that day was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. But when I was about to leave the museum, I found my umbrella was gone. So I ask the staff in the museum help me find my umbrella, then I saw this foreigner took my umbrella. When I noticed that the umbrella hold by the foreigner was mine, I was very angry so I ask him “ Why did you took my umbrella?” Don’t you know that it’s raining heavily outside? How can you not know?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misunderstanding of cultural norms and expectations
omission or addition	omitting important details	failure to mention the confrontation with the foreigner

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
So what color is the umbrella you took on that day? If there any specialty?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color is the umbrella you took on that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella you took on that day was blue, I think it might be dark blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the investigate file one, page five, the photo on the page. Is this umbrella on the photo, is this your umbrella?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s mine.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the photo is very common in Taiwan, it is the umbrella that you can buy at any convenience store. How can you be so sure that this is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the umbrella in the photo is common in Taiwan and can be bought at any convenience store, which may not be the case in other countries.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I buy my umbrella at the 7-11. However, my umbrella might be about to broken so it cannot be…together. About this point, I have explained to the police office on that day. And the umbrella was put back by the foreigner also have these features, from these points, it can be proved that this is my umbrella.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Can I ask you a question? If the plaintiff is regretful and he really wants to apologize to you, can you accept his apologize, after all, this is just an umbrella?

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by saying “just an umbrella”? I think it is a question about where a person have the…..or not. If he did not put it back, I might get wet in the heavy rain. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean by saying 'just an umbrella'?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'I think it is a question about whether a person has basic morals or not.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the person not returning the umbrella, which is an important detail in the context.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'I want them to come here and explain what happened on that day' is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I want them to come here and explain what happened on that day.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The date 'June 19th, 2014' should be in the future tense, as the court hearing is scheduled for a future date. The correct tense should be 'June 19th, 2014, at 3 p.m.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant in the sentence 'The witness and plaintiff have to come here.' The correct translation should be 'The defendant and the three witnesses have to come here.'

Yes, I will be here.
沒問題，我可以到。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Defendant, Ms.Chen, you can come here at next court. Basically, next we will ask question on the day to the three person, I mean the plaintiff’s professor and his classmates. Whether you come here or not are okay.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有。當我把傘放回傘架的時候陳小姐就在那邊了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐就在那邊了，當我把傘放回傘架的時候。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我狂吼，說我偷了她的雨傘。我嘗試告訴她我不小心拿錯了，我並沒有偷她的雨傘。我嘗試向她道歉但她都不理我，她都不想聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我嘗試告訴她我不小心拿錯了' (I tried to tell her I accidentally took the wrong one). The correct word order should be '我嘗試告訴她我不小心拿錯了'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why Miss Chen said you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'asked'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'said' before the subject 'Miss Chen', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟幾個同學去那邊看展覽。當我們參觀完以後我兩個同學說他們肚子餓了， 因此我們就決定出去找一些食物或者找晚餐的地點。 當我離開博物館的時候我發現正在下雨。 我沒有帶雨傘，所以我打算向同學借傘。 因為我有點高壯所以我想向我的同學Adam借雨傘，他的身形跟我差不多，所以我就從傘架拿一把傘。 我嘗試去買一些麵包給我的教授和我的朋友。 當我回來時就正是陳小姐對我吼叫的時候。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of yelling

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You said that the umbrella you borrowed is belonged to Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation incorrectly states that the umbrella belongs to Adam, while the original text does not mention the owner of the umbrella.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我想我借的就是亞當的。而且我沒有偷任何傘的意圖。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'thought' as '想' which means 'think' instead of '以為' which means 'thought'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella which you borrowed on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色。 它是藍色的，而且不是很新的傘。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjective '藍色的' (blue) after the noun '傘' (umbrella), which is incorrect. It should be '藍色的傘' (blue umbrella).

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is that the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
根據我的印象，顏色是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
當然。 當我離開博物館的時候我的教授和我兩個同學都跟著我。 我的教授甚至想借我她的雨傘，但我教授的雨傘很小所以我就沒有拿了。 我不想讓我的教授和其他兩位同學被雨淋濕。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '當我離開博物館的時候我的教授和我兩個同學都跟著我' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我離開博物館的時候，我的教授和我兩個同學都跟著我'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So your classmates and professor can come to the court to prove what you said, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我嘗試要把陳小姐的傘還她，但她不收。 我試著跟她道歉，但她完全不想接受。 也許我的教授跟我的同學可以證實我今天所說的話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著跟她道歉，但她完全不想接受" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我試著跟她道歉，但她完全不想接受".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Ok, now I want to ask Miss Chen what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you tell the details what happened on that day to us?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
It was raining and I went to The Yingge Ceramics Museum. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. After I left the museum， I found my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff of the museum to help me find my umbrella but the foreigner just came back and returned my umbrella. When I found he took my umbrella, I was so angry and asking him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? Who can do such a thing like that?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'the foreigner just came back' instead of 'the foreigner had just come back' to indicate the sequence of events.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user used 'Who can do such a thing like that?' instead of 'Why would someone do such a thing?' which is a more natural expression in English.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What the color and the shape of your umbrella which you took on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color and shape was your umbrella that you took on that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
I took a blue umbrella, is deep blue on that day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '藍色的' as 'blue' instead of 'deep blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the picture of the, page five. Is that the umbrella belonged to you?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it was my umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '對' as 'yes' instead of 'it'.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is a kind of common umbrella which can be bought easily in convenient store. How can you be sure that this umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I bought my umbrella in the convenient store. However, the button of my umbrella was broken. I can’t close my umbrella. When I tell the police, I mentioned this point to them. The umbrella which was returned by the foreigner has the same feature so I’m sure that he took my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'When I tell the police, I mentioned this point to them.' It should be 'When I told the police, I mentioned this point to them.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '由此可知' as 'so I'm sure'. The correct translation is 'thus it can be known' or 'therefore it can be inferred'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
I want to ask you a question. If the defendant regrets and he wants to apologize to you can you forgive him and reach a settlement with him because it’s just an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? This is about the basic moral of people. If he didn’t return my umbrella, maybe I needed to walk in the rain to home. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'it's just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean it's just an umbrella?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'What do you mean it's just an umbrella?' instead of 'What do you mean it's an umbrella just?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' which means 'if he didn't return it that day'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
The court will subpoena three people who the defendant mentioned: the professor and his two classmates to explain what happened on that day. The court will be set at 3pm on June 19th 2014. The defendant and three witnesses need to come to the court. The defendant are you ok on that time?

Yes, I will be here.
沒問題我可以到庭。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states 'Yes, I will be here,' indicating that the person will be present. However, the user's translation states 'No problem, I can go to court,' which suggests that the person is willing to go to court but does not necessarily imply that they will be physically present.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The plaintiff, Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not. Basically we will ask the professor and the classmates of the defendant. If you want to come to the court, that is ok.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The plaintiff, Miss Chen, can come to the court or not.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important information that the purpose of asking the classmates and professor is to gather information about the day they were together with the defendant.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, it’s not necessary because I need to have a day off if I come to the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about needing to take a day off if they come to court.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
Ok, I understand. So the court ends here. Please leave the court after the both parties sign the record.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
So, did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Wang?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the name of the plaintiff, Ms. Wang.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
的確我有看到，當我試著把傘放到雨架就看到她了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我試著把傘放到雨架時，就看到她了。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '他對我大聲吼' is incorrect. It should be '他大聲對我吼'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'stole' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我和我同學來這邊看一個展覽，當看完這個展覽之後，有兩同學說他們很餓，所以我們就一起出去買點吃的，然後找個地方吃晚餐，當我要準備離開博物館的時候，發現外面在下雨，因為我沒有帶傘，所以想跟其中一個同學借一把傘。因為我人高又魁，所以想跟其中一個叫亞當的同學借傘，我跟他體型比較像。所以就從傘架中拿了一把傘。我買一些麵包給同學和教授，當我回來的時候，就看到陳小姐對我大聲怒喊著。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我和我同學來這邊看一個展覽' is incorrect. It should be '我和我的同學來這邊看一個展覽'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you that the umbrella you borrow is belong to your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我以為我借的那把傘是我同學的，我沒有意思拿別人的傘
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'thought' as '以為' which means 'assume' instead of '認為' which means 'believe'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Can you tell what’s color and shape you took at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得我拿的那把傘是綠色，而且還不是全新的

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
The umbrella is whole blue?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'whole' is not appropriate in this context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Is the umbrella all blue?'

In my recollection, the color was blue.
我印象中好像是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '我印象中', which means 'in my impression'. This does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the adjective '藍色的' (blue), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '藍色的是' (blue is).

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Could anyone prove what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
當出來的時候，我和我教授還有同學一同出來，我教授甚至願意借我傘，但他的傘實在太小，所以我沒跟他借，我不想教授因為我而淋雨，當時我有兩個同學在那。

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著把這把傘還給他，但是他不願意。此外，我想道歉，但他也不願意接受。我想我同學和教授都可以證明我說所說的都是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著把這把傘還給他" is incorrect. It should be "我試著把這把傘還給她" to match the original text.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
Actually, the blue umbrella you claim belongs to you is easy to buy in convenience store, how could you say that this umbrella belongs to you
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the umbrella is easy to buy in a convenience store, instead of stating that it is a common type of umbrella that can be bought in a convenience store.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, my umbrella was bought in convenience store. The lock part of mu umbrella is little broken. I could not lock it up. I report this point when I reported to police. The umbrella which the foreigner took has the same specifics sot that I could say that the umbrella is mine.

 Is it possible that you forgive the defendant? After all, he has the sense of regret.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '妳有沒有可能原諒他呢?' as 'Is it possible that you forgive the defendant?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it was just an umbrella? I think it should be public norm. If he did not return the umbrella to me, I have to come home with big rain? I do not want to forgive him.

No.4 of 5F, No.132 Xie Fu Rd., Sanxia Dist., New Taipei City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
 The incident happened at May 27th, 2014 and the incident is that when the defendant visited the Yingge Museum, he took the plaintiff’s umbrella. This action happened without asking plaintiff’s permission. When the defendant wanted to give back the umbrella, the plaintiff found out this incident. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. Today our procedure is to clarify what happened at that day. Please answer my questions to help the prosecutors to know more about the detail. Later I will ask the plaintiff to know more about the incident. Do both of you understand this procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the date as 'May 27th, 2014' instead of 'May 27th, 103'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the defendant took the umbrella without the plaintiff's permission.

I understand.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you at 4:15 p.m. May 27th, 2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff at that day?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'see' should be in the past tense to agree with the past time frame.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
當我想把傘放回傘架的時候我有看到陳小姐。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我把傘放回傘架的時候，我看到了陳小姐。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大吼大叫，還說我偷了她的傘。我想要跟她說我只是拿錯傘了。我並沒有偷傘，我嘗試向她道歉但她並不接受。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我想要跟她說我只是拿錯傘了' is incorrect. It should be '我想要跟她說我只是拿錯了傘。'

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why would the plaintiff say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'the plaintiff' instead of 'Miss Chen'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'would' instead of 'did' in the question.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
事發當天我和一些同學去看展覽。當我們看完展覽的時候，我有幾個同學說他們肚子餓。因此我們決定走出博物館找些東西吃，甚至是吃晚餐。當我要離開的時候，發現正在下雨。我忘記帶傘了，所以想要和我同學借。因為我長得比較高大，所以我想要跟亞當，我的同學，借傘，他的體型和我比較相近，所以我就從傘架拿了一支傘。我就和我的老師和同學一起去買麵包了。當我們回來的時候就是事發的經過了，陳小姐就開始對我大喊。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You said that the umbrella you took at that time belonged to your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'borrowed' as 'took', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
 對，我以為我當時拿的傘是我同學的，所以我並沒有偷傘的意思。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'belonged to Adam'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember what the shape is the umbrella and what color is?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得它是藍色的，而且不是很新的傘。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjective '藍色的' (blue) before the noun '傘' (umbrella), which is the opposite of the correct word order in Chinese.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的記憶中，應該是藍色的吧。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '應該' (should) is added, changing the meaning of the sentence.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anybody can prove what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
 是的，當我走出博物館的時候，我和老師和同學在一起，我的老師甚至提議要借我傘。但她的傘比較小，所以我並沒有跟她借，因為不想要老師淋溼，然後還有其他兩個同學在，所以就跟別人借。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我和老師和同學在一起' is incorrect. It should be '我和老師和同學一起在一起'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor and classmates were with them when they came out of the museum.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the other two classmates were also present.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user borrowed an umbrella from someone else.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user didn't want the professor to get wet.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Can those three people come to the court as a witness to help you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試圖把傘還她但她不接受，我也試圖跟她道歉，但她一樣不接受。可能我的老師跟同學可以證明我今天所說的都是實話吧。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試圖把傘還她但她不接受" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我試圖把傘還給她但她不接受".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我也試圖跟她道歉，但她一樣不接受" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我也試圖跟她道歉，但她一樣不接受".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
 I’m going to ask some questions to the plaintiff, Ms. Cheng. Ms. Cheng, can you describe what happened at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Ms. Cheng, can you describe what happened that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
 I went to the Yingge Museum and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack at the front door. When I was going to leave, I found out that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff to help me find my umbrella. And at that time, I saw this foreigner came back and put back my umbrella. When I found out that the umbrella he took was mine, I angrily asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining? How could he do that?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they asked the staff for help in finding their umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊' as 'gone' instead of 'stolen'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'was' instead of 'were' in the question 'Didn’t he know that it was raining?'.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user used 'angrily' instead of a more polite expression to convey their emotions.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What was the color of the umbrella which you brought that day? Is there any feature?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella that you brought that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day was blue. Specifically, dark blue.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the detail that the umbrella should be dark blue.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the picture 5 in document 1. Is the umbrella in this picture your umbrella?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture is quite plain. It’s just a normal umbrella that you can buy in a convenient store. How can you confirm this umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker's perspective and replaced it with a general statement.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I just bought it in 7-11. However, my umbrella has a broken park, so I can recognize it. I have explained that to the police when I filed this case at the police station. The umbrella this foreigner put back shared the same feature, so I can say that it is my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the detail about the broken part of the umbrella
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	addition of unnecessary information about filing the case at the police station
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect interpretation of 'park' as 'park' instead of 'button'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant regrets for his behavior and has the will to apologize, would you accept that? After all, the thing you lost is just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
How could you say that it’s just an umbrella? It’s about the moral issue. If he didn’t put back, maybe I had went(gone) home in the heavy room. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	word choice errors	incorrect word choice: 'room' instead of 'rain'
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect verb tense: 'had went' instead of 'had gone'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of details: 'rain' is omitted
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of details: 'home' is omitted
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of details: 'in the heavy rain' is omitted

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
 I understand. We will subpoena those three people the defendant mentioned to the court as witnesses. Next court will be set at 3p.m., on June 19th, 2014. And the defendant and three of the witnesses should show up. Is this time okay for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會出席。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Plaintiff, the next court you may show up or not. Depends on you. Basically, we will ask some questions to the defendant and the witnesses, so if you wouldn’t show up is okay.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No I won’t come. I need to ask for a day off.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. Then, today’s court is adjourned. Please sign the document and you may leave.

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' should be translated as '她' since the person being referred to is a female.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why would Ms. Chien say you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'Ms. Chien' instead of 'Ms. Chen'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the evidence page number five the picture. Is this your umbrella?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes it is.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this photo is very common like the one you could buy in convenient stores. How could you know it was yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes I bought my umbrella at 7-11convenient store but the buckle was a little broken and couldn’t work well.About this point I explained to the police when I sued the case.The umbrella that foreigner put back to the umbrella rack also has that broken part so I know it was mine.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant was sorry and he would like to apologize, could you forgive him? After all it was only an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊的只是一把傘' as 'it was only an umbrella', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text implies that the stolen item was just an umbrella, but the user's translation suggests that the umbrella itself was not important.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it was only an umbrella?It is about …If he didn’t bring it back on that day, was I going to go back in huge rain?  I don’t want to forgive him.

Such incident happened when the defendant didn’t keep the plaintiff… known. When the defendant wanted to return the umbrella, the plaintiff found out immediately, found out right at the moment that the defendant took her umbrella, as a result, she sued the case. We are here to understand what had happened at that day. Please answer what we I ask you, so that the police can understand what had happened at that day, do you understand? I’ll also question the plaintiff, ask her about what had happened at that time, do both parties understand the procedure.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you at 4:15 p.m. on May 27th, 2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我那時候在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff at that time… Miss Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see Miss Chen, the plaintiff, at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
當我把她的傘放到傘架的時候, 我看到她了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我看到她了' instead of '我了看到她'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對我大吼大叫, 說我偷他的雨傘, 我試著告訴他說我一定是拿錯了, 我並沒有偷他的傘, 而且我還跟他道歉但他都不聽
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes cultural transformation by using the pronoun '他' (he) instead of '她' (she) to refer to the person yelling.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has subject-verb agreement errors by using '對我大吼大叫' (yelled at me) instead of '對我大吼' (yelled at me).

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和我一些同學一起到博物館看展覽, 當我們看完展的時候, 有兩個朋友說肚子餓了, 所以我們決定出去外面找找東西吃, 也順便找找晚餐要吃什麼, 當我離開博物館的時候, 我發現下雨了. 我沒有帶傘, 所以我那時候要跟我朋友借, 因為我有點高而且蠻壯的, 所以我就決定跟我一個叫亞當的朋友借跟他借雨傘, 他的體型跟我比較像,所以我從傘架拿了一支傘, 我就跟我的教授和朋友買了麵包, 當我回來的時候就是陳小姐對我大吼大叫的時候了
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning: 'borrow' instead of '借'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order: '我和我一些同學一起到博物館看展覽' should be '我和一些同學一起到博物館看展覽'

omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'When we came back' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me' in the translation

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed is your friend’s, Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '同學' as 'friend' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對我那時候以為那把傘是亞當的, 而且我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為那把傘是亞當的'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color, the size or the shape of the umbrella you took that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色, 是藍色的傘, 而且沒有很新
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'brand new' as '很新', which means 'very new', but the original text does not indicate that the umbrella was very new, just that it was not brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the umbrella blue… wholly?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'wholly' does not accurately convey the meaning of '整隻' which means 'entire' or 'whole'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'Is the umbrella wholly blue?'

In my recollection, the color was blue.
就我記憶所及, 好像都是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '就我記憶所及', which means 'as far as I remember' instead of 'In my recollection'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anyone can testify for you
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有, 當我從博物館走出來的時候, 有一位教授和兩個朋友和我一起, 我的教授當時甚至說她可以借我她的傘, 但她的傘蠻小的所以我就沒有跟她借了, 我不想要我的教授淋濕, 而且我另外兩個朋友也在那裡.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So these three can come to the court and verify for you, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是這樣的

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any other evidence you hope the police to help you to investingate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著要把傘還給陳女士, 但她拒絕了, 我想要跟她道歉但她也不接受, 我想也許我的教授和我的朋友可以證明我今天說的都是真的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence should be '我試著把傘還給陳女士' instead of '我試著要把傘還給陳女士'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Ok, now I’ll question Miss chen about the incident happened at that day. Miss Chen, could you elaborate what had happened at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to the Yingge ceramic museum, and it was raining. When I entered into the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack. When I came out, went out from the museum, I found my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff of the museum of to help me to find my umbrella, and at that time, I found the foreigner took my umbrella and put it back in the rack, When I found that the umbrella he took is mine, I was very angry and I questioned him, why did he take my umbrella? Didn’t he know it’s raining outside, how could he took other’s umbrella away?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'When I came out, went out from the museum'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in 'I found the foreigner took my umbrella'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '失竊的傘' as 'umbrella he took' instead of 'my stolen umbrella'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '外面在下雨' as 'it's raining outside' instead of 'didn't he know it's raining outside'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '沒有公德心' as 'took other's umbrella away' instead of 'lack of common decency'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
The umbrella you brought that day….What’s color is that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
I brought a blue umbrella, I believe it’s more like a navy color.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色' as 'navy color' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the evidence, page no,5, is this umbrella yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, this is my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the photo/ in the picture, is actually that kind which most people can buy from the 7-11, how could you be so confirmed that this umbrella belongs to you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, my umbrella was bought from the 7-11, but the bottom of my umbrella is a little bit broken, out of order, it didn’t work very well, for this point, I’ve already told and explained to the police when I reported the case. The umbrella that the foreigner took and returned had the same problem on the umbrella, so I believe that’s my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the phrase 'out of order, it didn’t work very well'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	the phrase 'out of order' does not accurately convey the meaning of '扣不太起來' which means 'cannot be fastened properly'
omission or addition	omitting important details	the user did not mention the specific location of the damage on the umbrella, which is '在釦子那邊' (at the button)
omission or addition	omitting important details	the user did not mention the specific characteristic of the umbrella that the foreigner returned, which is the same problem with the button
omission or addition	omitting important details	the user did not mention the fact that the umbrella was returned to the umbrella stand by the foreigner

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
May I ask you if the other party, the defendant, want to apologize and is very sorry about this, would you consider to forgive him? Since the thing you lost is just an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by only just an umbrella? It’s the issue about morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, what do you want me to do? Did I need to run in the rain and go home? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '只是' is translated as 'only just' instead of 'just' or 'simply', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'Did I need to run in the rain and go home?', where 'Did' should be 'Do'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand, then we will subpoena the three people the defendant had mentioned and ask them to come to the court and ask them to verify for the case. The next court will be set on 6/19/2014, at 3 p.m., is that okay with you? And in addition, the three witness have to come as well.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The next court will be set on 6/19/2014, at 3 p.m., is that okay with you?' is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Is that okay with you? The next court will be set on 6/19/2014, at 3 p.m.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the defendant and the three witnesses are required to attend the court.

Yes, I will be here.
好的我會到
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '到' is not the correct translation for 'here'.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not to come for the next court. Basically, we will question the professor and the classmates of the defendant, if you want to come, it’s still ok.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, I don’t want to come, if I have to come, I need to take a day off.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'Miss Chen' instead of 'Miss Chen'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
當天我和同學一起去博物館看展覽 我們看完展覽後，我的兩位同學說肚子餓了 因此我們決定出去買點東西來吃，或找個地方吃晚餐 就當我要離開博物館的時候，我看到外面在下雨 我當時沒有帶傘，所以我本來打算和我同學借一把 因為我人比較高大，所以我想要向我的朋友借一把傘，他的名字叫做亞當他的身型和我差不多 所以我就從傘架裡拿了一把傘 然後我就和我的教授和一些朋友去買麵包當我回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大喊

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
 Do you mean that the umbrella you took from the umbrella rack is the umbrella of your friend, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '借' as 'took' instead of 'borrowed'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'umbrella' after the verb 'took' instead of before it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was taken from the umbrella rack.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
 對，我當時就以為那把傘是我朋友亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you still remember the color and the shape of the umbrella you took?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you took?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色是藍色，但看起來並不新
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'not a brand new one' as '但看起來並不新', which means 'but it doesn't look new'. This is a mismatched meaning because the original text does not mention anything about the appearance of the item, only that it is not brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the umbrella all in blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的記憶中，它是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '在我的記憶中', which means 'in my memory', instead of '根據我的回憶', which means 'according to my recollection'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anybody can prove what you say is true?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有，當我從博物館出來的時候，我的教授和我的兩個同學在我身邊 我的教授甚至想要借我她的傘 但是她的傘太小了，所以我並沒有跟她借傘 我並不想要害我的教授淋溼，所以我也沒有跟另外兩位同學借傘

Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Now, I am going to ask Miss Chen about what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you briefly describe what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day. At that time, it was raining.When I entered the museum, I left my umbrella outside the museum.However, when I came out the museum, I found my umbrella missing.I asked the staff of Yingge Ceramics Museum for helping to find my umbrella. At that time, we found this foreigner taking my umbrella.When I found out that my umbrella was on his hand, I was very angry and I asked him why you stole my umbrella?Don’t you know that it is raining? It is really an impolite behavior.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was found and returned by the museum staff.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'steal' instead of 'took'.
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user used the word 'impolite' instead of 'lack of public morality' to describe the foreigner's behavior.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What is the color of the umbrella that you took on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The color of the umbrella is blue, kind of deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'kind of deep blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please see the investigatory file number one on the fifth page. Is this umbrella yours?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the photo in the translation.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on the investigatory file is quite a common type of umbrellas which everybody can buy it on 7-11. How you can say that it is the umbrella that is of yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
That’s true. That’s the umbrella I bought from 7-11.However, there is a problem on the button of my umbrella so it is hard to fold it.When I filed the case against him in the police office, I did mention this point.The umbrella that this foreigner put back into the umbrella rack is also with this special point so I regarded it was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The umbrella that this foreigner put back into the umbrella rack is also with this special point so I regarded it was my umbrella.' The correct word order should be: 'The umbrella that this foreigner put back into the umbrella rack is also with this special point, so I regarded it as my umbrella.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of reporting the case to the police when explaining the damage to the umbrella. The correct translation should include this detail: 'When I filed the case against him in the police office, I did mention this point.'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the other party does have the wiliness to settle this case and apologize, are you willing to accept his apology and settle the case? After all, it is an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions the possibility of forgiveness, while the user's translation focuses on settling the case.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it is just an umbrella? It is about does a person have morality or not.On that day, if he didn’t come back and put back the umbrella, I would go home in all wet.I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just', which does not convey the intended meaning of 'about' or 'related to'.

Defendant, are you fine with this date?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The next court date is set by nineteenth, June, 2014, at three p.m.' is incorrect. It should be 'The next court date is set for June nineteenth, 2014, at three p.m.'

Yes, I will be here.
是
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '是' is translated as 'yes' instead of 'will be'.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, you don’t have to be here on the next court date.Basically, on that day, we will ask some questions to his professor and fellow classmates. If you want to come, it is Okay.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff's presence in court on the next date.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened?

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
當天我跟一些同學去看展覽。看完展覽之後，我有兩個同學說肚子餓了。我們想要出來吃點東西，就是晚餐吧。我要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了。我沒有帶傘所以我想跟同學借一把。因為我人有點高大，所以我原本想跟亞當借傘。他的身形跟我比較像。所以我就從傘架拿一把傘，我跟教授跟朋友去買一些麵包。我回來，陳小姐就對我喊叫。

I went to the Ying-ge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. As I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. However, when I was about to leave the museum, I found the umbrella disappeared. I asked the staff find the umbrella for me. Then I saw this foreigner who is carrying my umbrella. When I found that the umbrella that he was taking was mine, I was furious.

This kind of umbrella can be bought in convenience stores, such as 7-11. How can you make sure that this umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated the sentence by adding unnecessary information about the umbrella being available in convenience stores.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought the umbrella at 7-11. And there’s some damage on the opening part. When I was at the police station, I told th police this point. And the umbrella also had the same trait. So I could say that that umbrella was actually mine.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean not a big deal? It’s about empathy. If he hadnt returned the umbrella, I must have been wet and walked all the way home. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of '只是' as 'not a big deal' instead of 'just' or 'simply'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. So the court will supoena three friends of the defendant and ask them to come to the court to… The next court date will be on June 19th, 2014. Is this date okay with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I will be here.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of specifying the time or duration of being present.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Ms. Chen, you could choose to come to the court. Or if you don’t want to, that is okay. Basicly, we will ask the three supeonas questions. If you want to come, you’re welcome

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the questions will be asked to the classmates and teachers who were present with the defendant on that day.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。

Rm. 4, 5F., No.132, Xuefu Rd., Sanxia Dist., New Taipei City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The time was 5/27 2013. In that time, the defendant took plaintiff’s umbrella in Yingge Ceramics Museum. The plaintiff was unknown with this case. When the defendant took the umbrella back, the plaintiff found what he did. So the plaintiff filed this case. Today’s procedure mainly understand what happened in that day. You have to answer my questions to make the prosecutor understand what happened in that day, do you understand? And I will ask the plaintiff what happened in that day. Do both parties understand this procedure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The time was 5/27 2013' is incorrect. It should be 'The date was 5/27/2013.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '造訪' as 'took' is incorrect. It should be translated as 'visited'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the defendant took the umbrella without informing the plaintiff.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the plaintiff discovered the defendant taking the umbrella back.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the plaintiff filed a case against the defendant.

I understand.
是的，我了解了。

我了解。
Yes, I understand.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, at 4:15 PM on 5/27 2014, where were you in that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時正在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'I' in the translation, which is an important detail.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff, Hsio Chien Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把傘還回傘架的時候，我有看到她。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有看到她' instead of '我看到有她'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened in that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她叫說我偷了她的傘。我試圖告訴她我只是拿錯了傘。我並沒有偷她的傘，我試圖向她道歉，但她還是大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '她叫說我偷了她的傘' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她叫我說我偷了她的傘'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why would Hsio Chien Chen say that you steal her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'Hsio Chien Chen' instead of 'Miss Chen'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'steal' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和同學們去博物館參觀展覽，當我們結束參觀展覽之後我有兩個同學說他們餓了。於是我們決定出去找東西吃，那大概是在晚餐的時間。當我們正要離開的時候，我們發現外面正在下雨。我並沒有帶傘，所以我打算和我的同學借傘。因為我人比較高大，所以我決定跟我的同學借一把比較大的傘。因為他的體型跟我比較像。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，我和一些教授還有我的同學同行。當我回去時，陳小姐就對著我大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '那大概是在晚餐的時間' is incorrect. It should be '那大概是晚餐的時間'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '借' should agree with the subject '我' and be conjugated as '借了' instead of '借'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '跟' should be in the past tense '跟了' to indicate borrowing the umbrella in the past.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after '我從傘架拿了一把傘' to separate the clauses.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean that the umbrella that you took is your friend, Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation incorrectly states that the umbrella was taken, instead of borrowed.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be changed to 'was' to match the past tense of the original text.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
沒錯，我那時候就想說，那把傘是亞當的。我並沒有打算要偷別人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我那時候就想說，那把傘是亞當的。'

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color and shape that umbrella you took?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得那把傘是藍色的，但不是一把新的傘。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the mention of the umbrella at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the past tense 'was' instead of the present tense 'is' to describe the color of the umbrella.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
So is only one color blue for the umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
就我所知，那把傘是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states 'In my recollection, the color was blue,' while the user's translation states 'As far as I know, the umbrella is blue.' The user's translation implies that the information is based on current knowledge, rather than a personal recollection.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Do anyone can verify what you state?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
當然阿，我身邊有一些教授和兩位朋友。我的教授甚至跟我說，要借我一把傘。但是她的傘太小了，不適合我。我不想要她淋濕，我的另外兩外同學也在旁邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我身邊有一些教授和兩位朋友' should be '我身邊有兩位朋友和一些教授'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor and classmates were with the user when they came out from the museum.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor offered to lend their umbrella to the user.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user didn't take the professor's umbrella because it was small and the user didn't want the professor to get wet.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that there were two classmates with the user and the professor.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three people can make it to verify this situation for you, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do any other … you want the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著還陳小姐傘，但她不想理我。我試著向她道歉，但她也不想理我。也許我的教授和我的朋友可以證實我今天所說的話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著向她道歉，但她也不想理我' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試著向她道歉，但她也不想理我'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Now, I am going to ask Ms. Chen what happened in that day. Ms. Chen, could you say what happened in that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
The day I went to Ying ge Ceramics Museum, it was a raining day. When I entered in the Museum, I put my umbrella in my umbrella rack. When I went out, I cannot find my umbrella. I asked the Museum’s officer to help me to look for the umbrella, and I found that the defendant out back my umbrella. When I found that he took my umbrella back, I was angry. And I asked him why he took my umbrella away. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How could he do that? So what’s the color of the umbrella you took in that day?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	defendant instead of foreigner
grammar and structure	word order errors	out back instead of brought back
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the color of the umbrella

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
And is any characteristic of that umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella that I took in that day is blue. Perhaps it’s deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'Perhaps it’s deep blue.' which does not accurately convey the meaning of '應該是深藍色的' (should be deep blue).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now, we are going to show you investigatory file of page5. The umbrella in the photo is yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it’s mine.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the photo is a very common type. Anyone can buy it in the convenient store of 7-11. How could you know it was your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the umbrella is a common type that can be bought at 7-11, instead of asking how the speaker knows it is their umbrella.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought it in 7-11. However, my umbrella’s button was broken, so the button cannot be used. For this point, I explained it when I told to the police. The umbrella that he put back meets this characteristic, so I think it’s my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'For this point, I explained it when I told to the police' is incorrect. It should be 'For this point, I explained it when I told the police.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'meets' should agree with the singular subject 'umbrella'. It should be 'meets' instead of 'meet'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the umbrella being put back on the umbrella stand by the foreigner.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
So would you forgive the defendant if he wants to regret and apologize for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
How can you say that? It’s about the basic moral. If he didn’t put the umbrella back, …. I wouldn’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. We will subpoena three of witness in that day, and we will try to ask them what happened in that day. Defendant, the next court date will set at3:00 P.M. in June 19 2014, and three of witness and you should make it, is that ok with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'We will subpoena three of witness in that day' should be 'We will subpoena three witnesses on that day'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence: 'Defendant, the next court date will set at 3:00 P.M. in June 19 2014' should be 'Defendant, the next court date will be set at 3:00 P.M. on June 19, 2014'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'to court' in the sentence: 'Defendant, the next court date will set at 3:00 P.M. in June 19 2014' should be 'Defendant, the next court date will be set at 3:00 P.M. on June 19, 2014 to court'.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會到庭。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Plaintiff, Ms. Chen, you can make it if you want. We will manly ask the defendant’s classmates and professors, you can make it or not.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the next court hearing.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
I wouldn’t make it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about needing to take leave.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. The court will dismiss here. Please sign the statement and leave the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court session being concluded and the instruction to leave the court after signing the statement.

我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大吼大叫說:「我她了她的雨傘。」我試著告訴他我是拿錯雨傘，我沒有偷她的雨傘，我有試著跟她解釋，但是她一點都不想聽我的解釋。

semantic conversion	omission of details	我有試著跟她解釋
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	我沒有偷她的雨傘

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Can you explain why Ms. Chen stated that you stole her umbrella?

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

那天我和我的同學去博物館看一場展覽。當我們看完展覽的時候，我的兩個同學說他們很餓，所以我們決定離開，去看看有沒有甚麼東西可以吃，所以我們就離開去找餐廳。當我離開博物館時，我發現下雨，我沒有帶傘，所以我打算跟我的同學借一把。因為我的體格比較高，所以我決定跟我的朋友Adam借傘。他和我的體格相近。然後我就雨傘架拿了一把雨傘。然後我打算去買一些麵包給我的教授和朋。當我們回來時，陳小姐看到我就對我大吼大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以我們就離開去找餐廳' (So we left to find a restaurant). The correct word order should be '所以我們就去找餐廳' (So we went to find a restaurant).
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '所以我們決定離開，去看看有沒有甚麼東西可以吃' (So we decided to leave, to see if there is anything to eat). The verb '看看' (to see) should agree with the plural subject '我們' (we), so it should be '所以我們決定離開，去看看有沒有甚麼東西可以吃' (So we decided to leave, to see if there are anything to eat).
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence '所以我打算跟我的同學借一把' (So I planned to borrow one from my classmates). The pronoun '我的同學' (my classmates) should be in the possessive form, so it should be '所以我打算跟我的同學們借一把' (So I planned to borrow one from my classmates).
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing punctuation in the sentence '然後我就雨傘架拿了一把雨傘' (Then I took one umbrella from the rack). There should be a comma after '然後' (Then), so it should be '然後，我就雨傘架拿了一把雨傘' (Then, I took one umbrella from the rack).

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You are saying that the umbrella you borrowed was your classmate’s,Adam’s, umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '同學' as 'classmate' instead of 'classmate's'

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我以為我拿的傘就是亞當的雨傘。我並沒有意圖打算要偷任何人的雨傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'steal' is used in the translation, which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The correct word should be 'take'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you rememer the shape and the colore of the umbrella you took?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得傘是藍色的，而且沒有很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the mention of the color at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the present tense '是' (is) instead of the past tense 'was'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella being 'not a brand new one'.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Was the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的記憶裡，它的顏色是藍色。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can someone prove what you say is truth?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
當我回到博物館時，我的教授和我的兩個朋友當時和我在一起。我的教授甚至本來打算要借我她的雨傘，但是她的雨傘有點小，所以我並沒有接受。我不想要讓教授淋溼，而且我的兩個同學也都在那裏。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '當我回到博物館時' is incorrect. It should be '當我從博物館出來時'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '當時' should agree with the subject '我的教授和我的兩個朋友', so it should be '當時和我在一起' instead of '當時和我在一起'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '打算要借我她的雨傘' is a mismatched meaning. It should be '提議借給我她的雨傘' to convey the meaning of 'offered to lend me her umbrella'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the professor offered to lend the umbrella. This detail is important for understanding the context.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So, the three person, who were with you, might can come to the cour to prove what you say is truth, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Incorrect subject-verb agreement in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'help' in the translation.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you want the court to imvestigate any evidence for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著要把傘還給陳小姐，但她不接受。我也試著跟她道歉，但是她一句話也不想聽我說。或許我的教授跟我的兩個同學可以證明我說的是實話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我也試著跟她道歉，但是她一句話也不想聽我說'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Okay,now I am going to ask Ms. Chen some questions about the detail on that day. Ms. Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
 I went to Ying ge Ceramic museum, and it was rainy. When I entered into the museum, I put my umbrella at the umbrella track. But when I came out, I couldn’t find my umbrella. I asked the staff in the museum to help me find my umbrella, and later I saw this foreigner came back and with my umbrella. When I found out that the umbrella he took was my missing umbrella, I was angry and I asked him: why do you took my umbrella? Don’t you know it was rainy outside? How can you do that without any ethics?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'umbrella track' instead of 'umbrella stand'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	using 'do' instead of 'did' in the question 'why do you took my umbrella?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	not mentioning that the user asked the museum staff for help before finding the umbrella
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	using 'without any ethics' instead of 'without any sense of public morality'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Can you tell me what’s the color of your umbrella and does it have any feature?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color is your umbrella?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The Umbrella I brought that day was blue, I think the color exactly it was deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '應該是深藍色的' as 'I think the color exactly it was deep blue', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the photo on page 5 of investigation file one. Does the umbrella in the photo belong to you?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is my umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '這把傘' as 'my umbrella' instead of 'this umbrella'.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the photo was very common; everyone can get one at the 7-11. How can you sure that the umbrella is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated the sentence by adding unnecessary information about the umbrella being available at 7-11.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
That’s true; I bought my umbrella at the 7-11. But my umbrella has some flaws and it cannot be hold tidily. When I filed the case, I specifically described this feature to the police. The umbrella which was taken by the foreigner has the same feature. So, in other words, that is my umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged and couldn't be closed properly.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'When I filed the case' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '扣不太起來' as 'it cannot be hold tidily' instead of 'it cannot be closed properly'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '特徵' as 'feature' instead of 'characteristic'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '由此可知' as 'So, in other words' instead of 'From this, it can be known'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant would like to apologize and show his regret, would you consider to settle the case with him?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Would you consider settling the case with him if the defendant would like to apologize and show his regret?'

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it is just an umbrella? It is about ethics. If he did not put my umbrella back, did you mean that I need to go home in such rain? I do not want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是' as 'just' instead of 'mean' or 'about'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'put' before the noun 'umbrella' in the sentence 'If he did not put my umbrella back'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '拿來還' which means 'return it' in the sentence 'If he did not put my umbrella back'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
 I understand. Then we will subpoena the three person who was mentioned by the defendant to describe what happened on that day. The next court date will be on July 19th, 2014. Defendant and three witness will be show up, are you okay with this arrangement, defendant?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The next court date will be on July 19th, 2014' is incorrect. It should be 'The next court date will be on July 19th, 2014.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the time of the court hearing. The original text mentioned 'at 3 o'clock in the afternoon', but the user did not include this detail in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context of the subpoena in the translation. The original text mentioned that subpoenas will be sent to the three individuals mentioned by the defendant, but this information is missing in the user's translation.

Yes, I will be here.
可以我會到。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. The correct translation should be '我會到可以。'

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
 Ms. Chen, the next court date you can decide to come or not. The main purpose on that day will be to ask defendant’s professor classmates some questions about that day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff's presence in court.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'defendant's professor classmates' before 'some questions', resulting in a confusing sentence structure.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
Well won’t show up. I don’t want to take one day off.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not wanting to take one day off.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. So the procedure ends here. Please leave after you sign the statement.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'Please leave after you sign the statement' instead of 'Please leave after you sign the statement.'

When you wanted to returned the umbrella, the plaintiff found that you took her umbrella. Therefore, she filed the case today we are going to understand what happened that day. Please answer my questions to let me…our….know what happened that day. After that, I will ask the plaintiff about the situation in that day. Do both parties know the procedure?

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you at 4:15 pm, on May 27, 2014.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff at that day?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'see' should be in the past tense to agree with the past time frame.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有,當我把雨傘放回傘架時,我有看到他
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '看到' should agree with the subject '我' (I), so it should be '我看到他' instead of '我有看到他'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
So what happened that day?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對我咆嘯,並說我偷了她的傘,我是有告訴他我只是拿錯散而已,我真的沒有偷他的傘,我試著向他道歉,但他完全不聽
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "他對我咆嘯,並說我偷了她的傘" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "他對我咆嘯，說我偷了她的傘".
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase "我是有告訴他" is a literal translation of "I tried to tell him", but it does not convey the same meaning. The correct translation should be "我試著告訴她".

Why did she say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'she' instead of 'Miss Chen'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'did' instead of 'does' in the question.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
在那天我和我的同學去參觀博物館,當我看完展覽之後,我兩個同學說他們餓了,所以我們決定出去找東西吃,看看要吃什麼晚餐,當我要離開博物館的時候,我發現正在下噢,我沒有帶傘,所以我想要跟我的同學借,因為我人比較高大一點,所以我想要像我的同學-亞當借傘,因為他體型跟我很像,所以我就從傘架上拿了一把傘,所以我想去買一些麵包給我的教授和同學,當我回來的時候陳小姐就在那哩,開始對我大叫
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'yell' is translated as '大叫' which means 'shout loudly' instead of '責罵' which means 'scold'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我想要像我的同學-亞當借傘' is incorrect. It should be '我想要借亞當的傘像我的同學一樣'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the professor and two other friends went with the speaker to buy bread.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you took was your friend, Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated 'borrowed' as 'took', changing the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的我當時認為那把傘就是亞當的,我當時並有想要偷任何人的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the shape and the color of the umbrella you took that day?

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得他是一把藍色的傘,而且不是一把新的傘
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'umbrella' as '傘' which means 'umbrella' instead of 'color' which means '顏色'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the speaker only remembering the color.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
So the whole is blue…..so the whole umbrella is blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我記憶中那把傘就是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '記憶' which means 'memory' instead of '回憶' which means 'reminiscence'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone prove your statement?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的當我離開博物館的時候我的教授跟我兩個同學都跟我一起,我的教授甚至說他要借我他的傘,但是因為他的傘實在太小了,所以我就沒有跟他拿,我不想要他被雨淋濕,而我也不想要另外兩個同學淋濕
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我的教授甚至說他要借我他的傘' should be '我的教授甚至說要借他的傘給我'.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想應該是可以

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
So do any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著把傘還他,但他不理我,我也試著向他道歉,但他也是完全不理睬我,或許我的教授跟同學可以為我佐證我說的話,也可以證明我那天的行為

In that day, I…. went to Yigge Ceramic Musem and it was a rainy day. I put my umbrella in. the umbrella rack before I went into the museum. But when I went out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the museum staff to help me to search my umbrella; finally, I found that the defendant took my umbrella. When I found that the umbrella he hold is my umbrella, I was very angry.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '藍色的' as 'blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now I’m going to show you a picture. In the file 1 ……….. Is that umbrella in the picture is yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it’s mine.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in that picture is very a common one which can buy in 7-11…in the convenience store. How can you sure that the umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'a' is missing before 'very common one'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of 'which can buy in 7-11' should be 'which can be bought in 7-11'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'in the convenience store' which is important for the context.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I bought my umbrella in the convenience store. However, there is some defect on my umbrella, it cannot be attached…. closely. I was….I told to the police that feature when I go to the police station. The umbrella backed to the umbrella rack has same feature, so I sure that it is my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'I was....I told to the police that feature when I go to the police station.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'The umbrella backed to the umbrella rack has same feature, so I sure that it is my umbrella.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the word 'not' in the sentence 'it cannot be attached…. closely.'
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	missing the context of reporting the incident to the police

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
So if the defendant is regrettable for this case. Do you want to settle this course? However, it is just a umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
Why do you mean “it is a umbrella?” It is concerned about morality. If he didn’t return my umbrella, should I went to home without umbrella? So I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '只是' as 'it is'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'should I went to home without umbrella'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. So we will subpoena the three people the defendant just mentioned to ask to explain what happened in that day. The next court set on the June 19, 2014. 3pm. Do both party can come to the court?

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, it is your choice to come or not to come. Basically, we will ask the defendant’s professor and friends to understand the details in that day.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?

So, Mr. Ho, can you tell me where were… where were you at 20… 2014, May 27th, 4…um…4:15 in the afternoon?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the question

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you… did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
當我要把傘放回傘架時，她就在那裏。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她就在那裏' instead of '就在那裏她'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大喊大叫，說我偷了她的傘。我告訴她我應該是拿錯傘了。我並沒有偷她的傘，我試著向她解釋，但她根本不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我應該是拿錯傘了' should be '我應該是拿錯了傘'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Then why Ms. Chen said you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'asked'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
當天我和一些同學到陶瓷館去看一個展覽。我們看完展覽之後，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定出去買點吃的，或是決定找個地方吃晚餐。我離開博物館的時候，發現正在下雨，因為我沒有帶傘，所以本來打算跟同學借一把。因為我人比較大隻，所以我打算跟我同學Adam借傘，他的身形跟我比較像。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘。然 後我就和我的教授和朋友去買了點麵包。我們回來的時候，那個時候就是陳小姐開始對我大喊大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們看完展覽之後' is incorrect. It should be '我們看完展覽後'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject '我的兩個同學' should be followed by the verb '說' instead of '說他們很餓'. It should be '我的兩個同學說他們很餓'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '決定' should be in the past tense to match the context. It should be '我們決定出去買點吃的' instead of '我們決定出去買點吃的'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun '我' should be used instead of '我們' in the sentence '所以我們決定出去買點吃的'. It should be '所以我決定出去買點吃的'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '所以我從傘架拿了一把傘' is incorrect. It should be '所以我拿了一把傘從傘架上'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after '然後' in the sentence '然後我就和我的教授和朋友去買了點麵包'.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The name '陳小姐' should be translated as 'Ms. Chen' instead of '陳小姐'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you took that day… you borrowed that day, was from your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	word choice errors	The word 'took' was translated as 'borrowed', which changes the meaning.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我以為那把傘是亞當的。我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Can you recall that the umbrella you took that day, the color and the shape…?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Can you recall the color and shape of the umbrella you took that day?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，是一把藍色的傘，而且沒有很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the umbrella being a 'one' and not 'brand new'.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Did the whole umbrella was blue?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
印象中，它就是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '印象中', which means 'in my impression', but the original text means 'from what I remember'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anybody can prove what you just said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
可以，當我從陶瓷館出來的時候，我的教授和兩個同學跟我在一起。我教授本來還說要借我她的傘，但她的傘…因為太小了，所以我沒有拿。我不想要教授淋溼，而且我的兩個同學也都在那邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '但她的傘…因為太小了，所以我沒有拿'

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So… the three person, your professor and your two classmates, they can vertify (verify) your words in the court, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice: 'vertify' instead of 'verify'.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence that you want the court investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我曾經…我試著把傘還給陳小姐，但她不拿；我也曾向…我也曾經試著跟他道歉，但她不聽。也許我教授和同學可以證明我所說的是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著把傘還給陳小姐' is incorrect. It should be '我試著把傘還給陳小姐'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也曾向…我也曾經試著跟他道歉' is incorrect. It should be '我也曾經試著向她道歉'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence '但她不聽'. It should be '但她不聽我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'my professor and my friends' in the sentence '也許我教授和同學可以證明我所說的是真的'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK. Now I’m going to ask Ms. Chen what happened that day. Ms. Chen can you give us a description what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Can you give us a description of what happened that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day, and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack outside the museum. When I got out, my umbrella was gone. I ask the staff to look for my umbrella, and that’s the time I saw this foreigner took the umbrella and put it back here. When I found out that umbrella was my missing umbrella, I was furious, and I asked why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside? How can he do such thing?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they asked the museum staff to help them find the umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '鶯歌博物館' as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' instead of 'Yingge Museum'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'that’s the time' instead of 'that was when'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The user used 'he' instead of 'the foreigner' when referring to the person who took the umbrella.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user did not translate '鶯歌' as 'Yingge', which is the name of a place in Taiwan.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Can you tell me the… the color and the shape… is there any feature of your umbrella you brought that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
It was blue, and I suppose it was a deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '應該是深藍色的' as 'I suppose it was a deep blue' instead of 'it should be a dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please see the investigatory book and the evident one. Can you tell us is the umbrella yours?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '提示偵卷' as 'investigatory book' instead of 'original text'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the photo being on the 5th page.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
Actually, this umbrella looks very common, is a very common…it’s a very common type umbrella. You can bought it…you can buy it in 7-11, how can you tell this is exactly your umbrella?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'bought' instead of 'buy' and repeated 'very common' unnecessarily.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'it' after 'bought' instead of before.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user repeated 'it's a very common' unnecessarily.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
But if the other side, if this foreigner, have the regretful thought and he wants to apologize, can you… do you consider to forgive him or reach a settlement? Because it’s just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has subject-verb agreement errors.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? It’s the problem of someone’s moral questions. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, what do you want? I walked… I walked home in those heavy rain? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'it's just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean it's just an umbrella'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. Instead of 'I walked... I walked home in those heavy rain?', it should be 'Do you want me to walk home in that heavy rain?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' which means 'if he didn't return it that day'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

The next court will be held at three o’clock afternoon, in 2014, June 19th. And the three witness and the defendant will here. Defendant, is this time OK for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'the court will send subpoena to the… those three party'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Incorrect subject-verb agreement in the sentence 'the professor and the two classmates, and ask them to vertify (verify) what the defendant said in the court'

omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after 'June 19th' in the sentence 'The next court will be held at three o’clock afternoon, in 2014, June 19th'

Yes, I will be here.
我可以，我會到場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
 Ms. Chen, you don’t have to be here in the next court. The main purpose that day will be asking what really happened from… ask professor and his classmates what really happened that day. But if you want to come… but if you want to come, it’s also welcomed.

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The defendant, Paul Anderson, was accused of theft for picking the plaintiff’s umbrella in Yingge Ceramics Museum at May 27th 2014. This action happened without inform the plaintiff. As the defendant tried to put the umbrella back, this action was found by the plaintiff. As a result, she sued the case. Today we are her for investigatory procedure. We are here today to clarify what happened on that day. Please answer my questions so that we can figured out what happened on the day. Do both parties fully understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (picked the plaintiff's umbrella) should be translated as 偷了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (stole the plaintiff's umbrella)

I understand.
我了解了

我了解。
I understand.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you and what were you doing at 4:15 PM on May27th 2014?

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Do you see the plaintiff Miss Chen at that time?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'see' should be in the past tense to agree with the past time indicated by 'at that time'.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
當我把傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐剛好在那裡
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐剛好在那裡' instead of '剛好在那裡陳小姐'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對著我大吼說我偷了她的雨傘，我試著跟她解釋我只是拿錯把雨傘了，我並沒有偷她的雨傘，我試著跟她解釋，但她不願意接受
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她對著我大吼說我偷了她的雨傘'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'I must have taken the wrong one' as '我只是拿錯把雨傘了' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be translated as '我可能拿錯了' to express the possibility of taking the wrong umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'I did not steal her umbrella' as '我並沒有偷她的雨傘' is incorrect. It should be translated as '我沒有偷她的雨傘' to convey the negation of stealing.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著跟她解釋，但她不願意接受' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試著跟她解釋，但她不願意接受我的道歉'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
So why did Miss Chen said that you stole her umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟我的同學一起到鶯歌陶瓷博物館去參觀，當我們看完展覽的時候，有幾個同學說他們肚子餓了，因此我們決定一起出去吃個東西，可能找地方吃晚餐，當我在博物館的時候，我發現正在下雨，因為我沒有帶傘　所以我想說跟我同學借一把傘，因為我比較高比較壯，所以我打算跟一名叫做泰德的同學借雨傘，他的身形跟我比較相像，所以我就從傘架裡面拿了一把傘，我想要跟我的同學還有教授一起去買麵包回來，當我們回來時，也就是陳小姐再對我大吼的那一刻。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong name used
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	verb form does not agree with subject

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean the umbrella is the one you borrowed from Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '同學' as 'Adam' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對我以為我拿走的是亞當的雨傘，我沒有意識到我拿錯了
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the umbrella you took on that day fits in what color?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得他是一把藍色的傘，看起來沒有很新
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'umbrella' as '傘' which means 'umbrella' instead of 'color' which means '顏色'.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
You mean the whole umbrella is blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我印象當中它應該是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '在我印象當中', which means 'In my impression'. The correct translation should be '在我回憶中', which means 'In my memory'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can somebody prove it for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有，當我從博物館出來的時候，我的教授跟同學們都可以幫我作證，我教授甚至說他可以把她的傘借給我，但因為她的傘太小了 所以我就沒有跟她借，因為我不想要讓她的身體也濕掉，而且當時還有兩個同學在旁邊
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'lend' as '作證'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the professor offering the umbrella because it was small

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three persons can prove it for you on the court, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'prove' should agree with the plural subject 'persons'.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you need any other assistance from the court?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about requesting the prosecutor to investigate specific evidence.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想要把傘還給她但是陳小姐不想接受，我嘗試跟她解釋，但她卻一點也不願意聽，也許我的教授跟我的同學們可以幫我證明我說的是真的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我想要把傘還給她" is incorrect. It should be "我想把傘還給她".
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb "不想接受" should agree with the subject "陳小姐". It should be "陳小姐不想接受".
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb "不願意聽" should agree with the subject "她". It should be "她不願意聽".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase "I tried to apologize to her" in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase "Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove" in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase "what I have said today is the truth" in the translation.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK now I am going to ask the plaintiff what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
On that day I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it was a rainy day. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. As I finished my exhibition, I found that my umbrella is gone. I asked the museum’s officer to help me for finding my umbrella. Later on, I found the defendant took my umbrella. As I found that he took my umbrella, I was very angry. And I asked him why he took my umbrella; didn’t he know it was raining outside? You can’t do that!
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misunderstanding of the concept of public morality
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the fact that the defendant returned the umbrella

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What’s the color of your umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I took on that day is a blue one, deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'deep blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the investigatory file, page 1. Look at the picture. Is the umbrella in this picture yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture is a very common one which can buy in any convenience store. How can you be so sure that umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '7-11可以買到的那種' as 'which can buy in any convenience store', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '7-11可以買到的那種'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes I bought it in a convenience store. It’s true but my umbrella’s button is broken. So I can easily recognize it. I told the police when I was at the police station. The umbrella, which the foreigners put back, also shares the trait. So I think that is my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'So I can easily recognize it.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was bought at 7-11.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they explained to the police about the broken button.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was put back by foreigners.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '由此可知' as 'So I think'. The correct translation is 'From this, it can be known'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Will you consider to forgive him if he sincerely apologize to you. It’s just an umbrella, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean about it’s just an umbrella? This is something about moral, attitudes. If he didn’t put the umbrella back, maybe I have to go home with the pouring rain. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'it's just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean about it's just an umbrella?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the phrase 'What do you mean about it's just an umbrella?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' which means 'if he didn't put it back that day'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. OK then we will send three sopeanas to those people he just mentioned and ask them come to the court to explain what happened on that that. The next court is at 3 PM on June19th, in 2014. Is the defendant and your three friends be here? Is that ok with you?

Yes, I will be here.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, the next court you can choose to come or not. It depends on you. Basically, we are going to ask the defendant and his friends and his professor. So if you are not here, it’s okay.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The next court you can choose to come or not, Miss Chen.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the purpose of asking the defendant's friends and professor is to gather information.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
I won’t be here. I don’t want…

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟我的一些同學去那邊看一個展覽。我們看完之後，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們就出去想找點吃的，或許就是吃個晚餐這樣吧。正當我要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了。我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟我一個同學借。因為我就是蠻高…蠻大…蠻胖的，所以我想跟我的朋友亞當借一隻傘，他跟我的體型比較像。所以我有從傘架拿了一隻傘，然後我就跟教授去買一些麵包，當我回來的時候陳小姐就開始對我叫。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對啊，我以為我拿的傘是亞當的，我沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Was the umbrella blue? All over the umbrella blue?

In my recollection, the color was blue.
嗯，回想起來是沒錯。

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有啊，我那時候走出博物館的時候，我的教授和我的兩個同學都和我在一起。我的教授還說她可以把傘借給我。但因為她的傘很小，我就沒有跟她借。我不想要她淋濕，而且我還有兩個同學在旁邊。

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
On that day I went to Ying Ge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. When I went into the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack, and when I came out, my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff of the museum to look for it for me, and then I see this foreign coming back, wanting to put the umbrella back. When I found that the umbrella he was taking is mine, I was very angry and questioned him why he took my umbrella away. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How can a person have no such responsibility?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was found and returned by the foreigner.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'wanting' instead of 'was' in the sentence 'and then I see this foreign coming back, wanting to put the umbrella back.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '質問' as 'questioned' instead of 'asked' in the sentence 'I questioned him why he took my umbrella away.'
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user used 'Didn’t he know' instead of 'Did he not know' in the sentence 'Didn’t he know that it was raining outside?'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
So…what color was your umbrella on that day? What other traits did it have?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was your umbrella on that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought on that day was blue. It was dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please look at the picture on page five on the investigation file. Please take a look at the picture. Is this umbrella yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it was that umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on the photo was very ordinary. It’s like one you can buy in 7-11. How can you make sure it was yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '照片中這把傘是很普通的那種' as 'The umbrella on the photo was very ordinary.' The correct translation should be 'The umbrella in the photo is a very ordinary one.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'was' before the subject 'umbrella' in the sentence 'The umbrella on the photo was very ordinary.' The correct word order should be 'The umbrella in the photo is a very ordinary one.'

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I did buy my umbrella at 7-11. However there was a damage on the button part, so I know it was mine. I did explain about this when I filed for the case to the prosecutor. The umbrella which the foreigner put back also possesses that trait…so I know that the umbrella is mine…was mine.
grammar and structure	tense errors	inconsistent verb tense
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'put back'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'when I filed for the case to the prosecutor'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then I would like to ask you, if the other…the defendant…is willing to regret and apologize, would you forgive him? Because it was just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by referring to the defendant instead of the other person mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant being willing to regret and apologize.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by it was just an umbrella? It is a matter of whether he cares for others or not. If he didn’t take the umbrella back, do you want me to go out when it was raining? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'it was just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean by it was just an umbrella'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' which means 'if he didn't take it back that day'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. So I will subpoena the three people he mentioned to the court and ask them to prove what he said was right. The next court will be set at 3 PM, June 19th, 2014. Plantiff, defendant, and the three witnesses should be here. Defendant, is the date OK with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Plantiff, defendant, and the three witnesses should be here.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of sending subpoenas to the three people mentioned by the defendant.

Yes, I will be here.
好的，我會到。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, you may come or not in the…on the next court. Basically who we are asking are the defendant’s professor and classmates, but if you would like to come, it will be OK as well.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, I don’t think I’m coming. I need to take that day off if I would like to come.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

The incident happened on May 27th ,2014. At Yingge Ceramics Museum. The defendant took the plaintiff Chen Xiao Chen’s umbrella.

Later I will ask the plaintiff some questions. Do the both party understand the procedure?

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, Where were you at 4:15 in the evening, May 27th ,2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Where were you at 4:15 in the afternoon on May 27th, 2014?'

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see Miss Chen? The plaintiff ?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'you' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'did' instead of 'do' in the question.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有，當我把傘放回傘架上時，她就在那裏
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened that day?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大叫，說我偷了她的傘，我試著告訴她我一定是拿錯了， 我並沒有偷， 我試著跟他道歉，但她不聽
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著跟他道歉" is incorrect. It should be "我試著跟她道歉" to match the gender of the person being apologized to.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the pronoun "I" in the sentence "我試著告訴她我一定是拿錯了". It should be "我試著告訴她我一定是拿錯了" to indicate that the user is the one who took the wrong umbrella.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why Miss Chen said you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'asked'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'said' before the subject 'Miss Chen', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我跟一些同學去博物館看展， 我們看完時，有兩個同學說他們餓了，所以我們決定出去買一些東西，甚至去找吃晚餐的地方，當我們要離開博物館時，我發現下雨了，我沒有帶傘，所以決定跟我同學借，因為我比較高大，我決定跟亞當借傘，他的身型跟我比較像， 我從傘架拿了一把傘，我跟兩個同學還有教授去買了一些麵包 ，我們回來的時候就是陳小姐對我大叫的時候
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我們看完時' (When we finished viewing)

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean the umbrella you borrowed is Adam’s umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '同學' as 'umbrella' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對 ，我想我拿的傘是亞當的 ，我沒有企圖要偷別人的傘
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'steal' was translated as '偷' which means 'to steal' in Chinese, but in this context, it should be translated as '拿' which means 'to take'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color or the shape of the umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，不是新的
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the item not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我記憶裡，它是藍色的

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can someone verify what you just said?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
當我離開博物館時，我的教授跟兩個同學跟我一起，我的教授甚至提議借我傘， 但他的傘有點小，我沒有拿， 我不想他淋濕， 我的其他兩個同學也在那裏
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我的教授跟兩個同學跟我一起' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我跟我的教授和兩個同學一起'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '跟' should be followed by the subject '我', not '我的教授'. The correct sentence should be '我跟我的教授和兩個同學一起'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '跟' should be in the past tense to match the context of the sentence. The correct sentence should be '我跟我的教授和兩個同學一起走出博物館時'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the professor and classmates were with the user when they came out from the museum. The correct translation should include this detail.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So three of them can be in court to verify what you just said, Right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著把傘還給陳小姐，但她不接受，我試著跟他道歉，她也不接受 也許我的教授跟朋友能證明我今天說的都是真的
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我試著跟他道歉' (I tried to apologize to her). The correct word order should be '我試著跟她道歉' (I tried to apologize to her).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'either' in the sentence '我試著跟他道歉，她也不接受' (I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn't listen to me, either). The correct translation should be '我試著跟他道歉，她也不接受，也不聽我' (I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn't listen to me, either).

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Ok, now I am going to ask Miss Chen the details on that day.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I want to Yingge ceramics museum on that day. It was raining. When I was about to enter the museum, I put the umbrella on the umbrella track. When I came out, it disappeared. I ask the staff to help me find it. Later I saw the foreigner put the umbrella back. I was angry. Ask him why did you take my umbrella? Didn’t he know it was raining outside? How a person can be so impolite?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I want to Yingge ceramics museum on that day.' It should be 'I went to the Yingge ceramics museum on that day.'

The umbrella in the picture is general. You can buy it in the convenient store. How could you sure it is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought it in 7-11. But the locker part of the umbrella is broken. It cannot luck. When I report the case, I explained it to the police carefully. The umbrella the foreigner put back has the same feature, so it is my umbrella.

The defendant, Paul Anderson, on May 27, 2014 went to Inge Museum and had taken the umbrella of the plaintiff, Xiao-Chen Cheng. This act was committed without notifying the plaintiff beforehand. When you were going to return the umbrella, you were caught red-handed with the umbrella by the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff pressed the charge. The goal of our procedure today, is to understand what happened that day. Please answer accordingly to my questions, do you understand? Later on, I will also inquire the plaintiff to understand what happened that day. Do both parties understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Inge Museum should be translated as Yinge Museum
omission or addition	omitting important details	The date should be translated as May 27, 2014 instead of 103年05月27日

I understand.
我了解

我了解。
 I understand, too.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
This question is for the defendant. On 4:15PM of May 27th 2014, where were you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen, at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you see Ms. Chen, the plaintiff, at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有，我當時要把傘放回傘架時有看到他
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '看到' should agree with the subject '我' (I), so it should be '看到了' (saw).

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'then' which is important for the context.

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她向我大叫，說我偷了她的傘。我嘗試告訴他我可能搞錯了，拿錯傘。我並不是在偷他的傘，我…嘗試要向他解釋，但他不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我並不是在偷他的傘，我...'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '拿錯傘' is translated as 'taken the wrong one' instead of 'took the wrong one'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'She yelled at me' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'I tried to apologize to her' in the translation

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Then why would Ms. Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和幾個同學一起去看展。看完展後，我有幾個同學說他們餓了。所以我們決定出去找個東西吃，可能找個地方吃晚餐。當我們要離開博物館時，我們發現開始下雨了。因為我本來沒有帶傘，我本來要和我同學借。因為我身形比較高大，我本來要和我朋友亞當借傘。他的體型和我比較相近。之後我就從傘架裡面抽了一支傘，然後和我的教授和同學們出去了。當我們回來的時候，就是被陳小姐大罵的時候。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我和幾個同學一起去看展' should be '我和幾個同學一起去看展覽'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我本來要和我同學借' should be '我本來要和我的同學借'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我本來要和我朋友亞當借傘' should be '我本來要和我的朋友亞當借傘'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '之後我就從傘架裡面抽了一支傘' should be '之後我就從傘架裡面抽了一把傘'

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
So you mean the umbrella you borrowed belonged to Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '同學' as 'Adam' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我以為我手中那隻傘是亞當的，而我沒有意圖偷那支傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella that day?

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得傘的顏色，他是藍色的，也不是新的那種。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the mention of the umbrella at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the past tense 'was' instead of the present tense 'is' to describe the color of the umbrella.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
The whole umbrella is blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
回想起來，傘的確是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '回想起來' which means 'recall' or 'remember', but the original text implies that the color was blue in the user's memory.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone prove that for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有，當我離開博物館的時候，教授和兩個同學都在我身邊。我的教授甚至主動借我他的傘。但是因為他的傘比較小，我就沒有答應他。我不想要老師林濕。當然我另外兩個同學…當時也在場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我就沒有答應他' is incorrect. It should be '我就沒有答應他的傘'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun '他' should be '她' to match the gender of the professor.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor's umbrella was small, which is important for understanding why the user didn't take it.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the sentence '當然我另外兩個同學...當時也在場', which is not present in the original text and is unnecessary.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three people you mentioned will be able to come to court to prove your statement, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Are there any evidence you wish the prosecutor to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想要歸還傘給陳小姐，但他不願意拿。我嘗試向她道歉，但她不願意聽我說。或許我的教授和朋友們可以幫我證明我今天講的話屬實。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我想要歸還傘給陳小姐' (I want to return the umbrella to Ms. Chen). The correct word order should be '我想要歸還陳小姐的傘' (I want to return Ms. Chen's umbrella).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我嘗試向她道歉' (I tried to apologize to her). The correct word order should be '我嘗試向她道歉' (I tried to apologize to her).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '但她不願意聽我說' (but she wouldn't listen to me). The correct word order should be '但她不願意聽我說' (but she wouldn't listen to me).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '或許我的教授和朋友們可以幫我證明我今天講的話屬實' (Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth). The correct word order should be '或許我的教授和朋友們可以幫我證明我今天講的話是真實的' (Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove that what I have said today is true).

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
All right, now I will inquire Ms. Chen for what happened that day. Ms. Chen, can you explain what happened that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
When I went to Inge Museum, it was raining then. When I entered the museum, I placed my umbrella in to the umbrella rack. But when I came out, my umbrella was missing. I asked the museum staff to help me look for the umbrella. And when I came back, I found this person returning the umbrella. When I realized the umbrella in his hands belonged to me, I was very angry and I asked him why did he take my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside, how could he be so impolite?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was found and returned by the foreigner.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form '拿' instead of '拿回來' to indicate that the foreigner returned the umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '沒有公德心' as 'impolite' instead of 'lack of civic-mindedness'.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What color was your umbrella? Are there any characteristics to it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought to the museum that day was blue. It should be dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Is the umbrella in this picture…Does this umbrella belong to you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, this is my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture is a very…. common umbrella. The kind of umbrella you can find in 7-11, how do you know the umbrella belongs to you?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'common' does not accurately convey the meaning of '普通' in this context.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
That’s true, I bought my umbrella at 7-11, but the button on my umbrella is a bit broken. On this point, when I filed the case to the police, I emphasized this point.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the umbrella was put back on the umbrella stand by a foreigner.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
The umbrella the foreigner placed in the umbrella rack had the same characteristic, so I knew the umbrella was mine. May I ask you if he regrets what he did and is willing to apologize, are you willing to forgive him? I mean it is only an umbrella after all.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was stolen.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by “it’s only an umbrella.” If he didn’t return it to me that day, I would have to go home in the rain. I am not willing to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'only' instead of 'what do you mean by'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'return' before the subject 'he' instead of after
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'if he didn't return it to me that day' in the translation

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. Then we will send warrants to the three people… the three witnesses that day, and ask them to come to court. The next court will be held on June 19th 2014, at 3PM, the three witnesses and the defendant should be here in court. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'the three people... the three witnesses that day' should be 'the three witnesses... that day'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage: 'The next court will be held on June 19th 2014' should be 'The next court will be held on June 19th, 2014'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error: 'the three witnesses and the defendant should be here in court' should be 'the three witnesses and the defendant should be in court'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail: The original text mentions that warrants will be sent to the three people, but the translation omits this information.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail: The original text mentions that the three witnesses and the defendant should be in court, but the translation omits this information.
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after the date in the sentence: 'June 19th 2014, at 3PM' should be 'June 19th, 2014, at 3PM'.

Yes, I will be here.
是，我會到場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我會到場' instead of '是，我會到場。'

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The plaintiff, Ms. Chen, the next court you can choose to come at your will. Basically, this is an inquiry for the defendant and his two classmates and professor, so it will be all right if you don’t come.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
I think not… because I’d have to… take a day off from work.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'take a day off from work', which is an important detail in the original text.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. All right, our court ends here. May the two parties please sign here, and you may leave.

今為偷竊案件偵字1425號偵查程序

The fifth floor number four, number 132, Xue-Fu Road, Sanshia district, New Taipei City.

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The incident happens on May 27, 2014. The defendant Paul Anderson took an umbrella when he was in Ying Ge Ceramics Museum, and the defendant Paul Anderson took the plaintiff’s umbrella without informing her. When the defendant wanted to return the umbrella back to its owner, Hsiao-Chien Wang…caught him. Therefore, Hsiao-Chien Wang filed this case. In today’s procedure, we need to mainly understand what happened that day. Please answer all of my questions so that the prosecutor can understand what exactly happened that day, do you understand? And after this procedure, I will ask the plaintiff what really happened that day, so do both parties understand today’s procedures?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the name of the plaintiff as 'Hsiao-Chien Wang' instead of '陳小倩'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'caught' before the subject 'Hsiao-Chien Wang', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the defendant returned the umbrella back to its owner.

I understand.
了解了。

我了解。
Me, too. I understand, too.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you at four fifteen, on May 27, in year 2014? Four fifteen in the afternoon….
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect. It should be 'Where were you at four fifteen on May 27, 2014?'

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我那時在三峽鶯歌陶瓷的博物館。
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '三峽鶯歌陶瓷的博物館', which means 'Yingge Ceramics Museum in Sanxia'. The user misunderstood the location of the museum.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
 Did you see the plaintiff Hsiao-Chien Chen at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The subject and verb are in the wrong order.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有，在我把傘放回傘架時，小倩小姐就在那理。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '小姐小倩' instead of '小倩小姐'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她大喊:「是你偷了我的傘!」我告訴她我應該是拿錯傘了啦。我真的沒有偷她的傘，我一直試著跟她道歉，但是她就是不接受。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我告訴她我應該是拿錯傘了啦" is incorrect. It should be "我告訴她我應該是拿錯了傘啦".
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase "拿錯傘了啦" is translated as "must have taken the wrong one" which does not accurately convey the meaning of "拿錯了傘啦" which means "took the wrong umbrella".

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Then why did Hsiao-Chien Chen claimed you of stealing her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐會說' as 'claimed' instead of 'said'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'claimed' instead of 'claimed that', resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the possessive pronoun 'her' before 'umbrella'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館參展看展啊。看完展覽後，其中有兩個同學就說他們餓了。所以我們就決定出去找找食物，找個能吃晚餐的地方。一離開博物館的時候，就下雨了。因為我沒有帶雨傘，所以我就決定借我同學的傘。因為我比較高壯一點，所以我就決定借我同學亞當的傘，因為他的體型跟我很像。所以我就從傘架拿出一個傘，然後和我的教授和兩個朋友一起去買麵包。當我們這群人回到博物館後，陳小姐就對我大喊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '一離開博物館的時候' is incorrect. It should be '離開博物館的時候一' to follow the correct Chinese sentence structure.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '參展看展' should be separated into two separate verbs '參展' and '看展' to maintain subject-verb agreement.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '就決定' should be in the past tense '就決定了' to match the past tense context of the sentence.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun '我們這群人' should be '我們' to avoid redundancy and maintain clarity.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '找個能吃晚餐的地方' is translated as 'find a place for dinner' which does not accurately convey the meaning of '找個能吃晚餐的地方' which means 'find a place where we can eat dinner'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that Ms. Chen started to yell at the speaker.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
 So do you mean that at that time, the umbrella that you borrowed was…you borrowed it from Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '你同學亞當的' as 'you borrowed it from Adam' instead of 'the umbrella of your classmate Adam'

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的。我當時是真的認為是亞當的傘。我根本就沒有想到要偷別人的傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of 'belonged to' as '認為是' (thought it was).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase '是亞當的傘' (belonged to Adam), where the subject and verb are reversed.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Then do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you took that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，然後沒有很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the item not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
據我所知，對，全部都是藍的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by adding the phrase '全部都是' which means 'all of them' and implies that everything was blue, not just the color.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can someone proof what you said was right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
可以啊，跟我出去的教授還有兩位同學一起來開博物館，他們可以證明。我教授甚至還願意借我他的雨傘。但是由於他的傘太小，所以我就謝絕他。而且我也不希望我的教授淋雨啊，那時候我兩個同學都在。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	教授 -> 教授甚至還願意借我他的雨傘
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	我 -> 我的教授淋雨啊
omission or addition	omitting important details	我 -> 我兩個同學都在

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
If so, then these three people will be able to come to the court and play as the role of the witnesses, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I guess so.
應該可以吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Then is there anything else you wish the prosecutor to investigate?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著要還給陳小姐她的傘了，但是她不接受，然後我試著跟她道歉，她也不接受。我認為我的教授和兩位同學都來到這裡證明我所說得一切都是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著要還給陳小姐她的傘了" is incorrect. It should be "我試著要把她的傘還給陳小姐了".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著跟她道歉，她也不接受" is incorrect. It should be "我試著跟她道歉，但她也不接受".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense in the sentence "我認為我的教授和兩位同學都來到這裡證明我所說得一切都是真的" is incorrect. It should be "我認為我的教授和兩位同學都會來到這裡證明我所說的一切都是真的".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Okay, now let me ask Ms. Chen what really happened that day. Can you describe what happened that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
That day, it was raining, and I went to the Ceramics Museum in Ying Ge. Before entering the museum, I placed my umbrella on the umbrella rack. But when I came out of the museum, my umbrella was gone. I asked one of the workers in the museum to help me find the umbrella, and I saw this young man taking my umbrella at that time. When I saw my umbrella on his hand, I was very, very furious, and I questioned him loudly why he would want to take my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining hard at that time? Did he have any conscience?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was found and returned by the museum staff.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'have' instead of 'has' in the question 'Didn’t he know that it was raining hard at that time?'
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user used 'conscience' instead of '公德心' (sense of public morality), which is a cultural-specific concept.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Then may I ask you that what color was your umbrella that you brought that day? Did it have any special symbols?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'May I ask you what color your umbrella was that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
Well, the umbrella that I brought that day was blue. It was dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now let us look at evidence number one, page five. Please take a look at this photo. Was this umbrella yours?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in the original text.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s it. That’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture was just a very, very normal umbrella, which can be purchased in any convenience store, such as 7-11. How can you prove that this was the umbrella that you brought that day?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker's ownership of the umbrella.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
You’re right, I brought the umbrella at 7-11. However, there is something wrong with my umbrella. The button of my umbrella couldn’t work. Therefore, when I filed this case, I had explained clearly to the police about this trait. Moreover, the umbrella that this foreigner took and put back had this trait, too; therefore, I can prove that that was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The button of my umbrella couldn’t work.' It should be 'My umbrella's button couldn't work.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'The umbrella that this foreigner took and put back had this trait, too; therefore, I can prove that that was my umbrella.' It should be 'The umbrella that this foreigner took and put back has this trait, too; therefore, I can prove that it was my umbrella.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the detail that the user explained the trait of the umbrella to the police when filing the case.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of unnecessary content in the sentence: 'Moreover, the umbrella that this foreigner took and put back had this trait, too; therefore, I can prove that that was my umbrella.' The phrase 'that that' is redundant and can be simplified to 'that'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then, now the defendant apologized to you…is willing to apologize to you and showed some regrets, are you willing to forgive the defendant? Because it’s just….he accidentally took your umbrella.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of the umbrella being stolen.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
 Hey, what do you mean by saying that it was just an umbrella? It shows that this person has no conscience. I assume that if that person didn’t return my umbrella back to me on that day, then I would just end up being all wet. I will not forgive the defendant.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'only an umbrella'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'didn’t return' instead of 'doesn't return' to match the present tense used in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'if that person didn’t return my umbrella back to me on that day' from the translation.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Okay, I understand now. We will subpoena the three people as witnesses to the court, the three people that the defendant just mentioned. We’ll set up a time to open a court next time at three o’ clock pm, on June 19, 2014, and the defendant plus the three witnesses should all be here. Defendant, do you understand?

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the location where the court will be held.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我了解了。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
As for Ms. Chen, the plaintiff, you can come to the court next time, or you can choose not to. Basically, during the next court…the procedure of the next court, we will mainly ask the witnesses, including the professor what happened that day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific mention of the classmates who were present with the defendant.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'during the next court' in an awkward position in the sentence.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
Well, I won’t come on that day because I even need to take a leave.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the specific day they won't come.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
Okay, now I understand, and the court is adjourned today. Please sign the document here, and both parties can leave the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the instruction for the parties to leave the court after signing the document.

Fifth floor, room 4, number 132, Xuefu road, Sanxia district, New Taipei City.

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The incident happened on May 27th, 2014. The defendant took the plaintiff’s umbrella when he paid a visit to Yingge Ceramics Museum. This behavior took place without the consent to the plaintiff. When the defendant wanted to return the umbrella, the plaintiff found the defendant as well as her umbrella. Therefore, the plaintiff filed the case. The main purpose of this procedure is to understand what exactly happened on that day. Please answer my questions so that the prosecutor can understand the whole story on that day. Besides, the court will ask the plaintiff as well to understand the details on that day. Do you understand?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '告訴' as 'case' instead of 'lawsuit'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'The incident happened on May 27th, 2014' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'The incident happened on that day'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's name, Paul Anderson, in the translation.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you at 4:15 p.m. on May 27th, 2014?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see the plaintiff at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
沒錯，當我把傘放回傘架時，陳小姐就在那邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐就在那邊，當我把傘放回傘架時。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我喊說，我偷了她的雨傘。我試著跟她說，我是拿錯傘了。我並沒有都她的雨傘，我試著跟她道歉，但她都不理我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我並沒有都她的雨傘'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Then, how come the plaintiff said that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'the plaintiff' instead of 'Miss Chen'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
在那天，我跟我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館。當我們逛完博物館後，有兩個同學說他們肚子餓了。所以我們想出去買晚餐，或是找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開的時候，我發現外面在下雨。我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想要借我朋友的傘。因為我有點高大，所以想跟我的同學亞當借雨傘。他的體型跟我較接近。然後我就從傘架拿了一把傘。然後我就和我的教授跟朋友一起買了麵包。但我回來的時候，陳小姐就對我大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我跟我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館' (I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum with my classmates). The correct word order should be '我跟我的同學去了鶯歌陶瓷博物館'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '有兩個同學說他們肚子餓了' (Two classmates said they were hungry). The correct verb form should be '有兩個同學說他們肚子餓'.

grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence '所以我們想出去買晚餐，或是找個地方吃晚餐' (So we want to go out and buy dinner, or find a place to eat dinner). The correct pronoun should be '所以我們想出去買晚餐，或是找個地方吃晚餐' (So we wanted to go out and buy dinner, or find a place to eat dinner).
grammar and structure	preposition errors	Preposition error in the sentence '當我要離開的時候' (When I want to leave). The correct preposition should be '當我要離開時' (When I was about to leave).
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing punctuation in the sentence '然後我就從傘架拿了一把傘' (Then I took one umbrella from the rack). The correct punctuation should be '然後我就從傘架拿了一把傘。' (Then I took one umbrella from the rack).
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in the sentence '我跟我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館' (I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum with my classmates).

cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	Failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language in the sentence '我發現外面在下雨' (I found it was raining outside). The idiomatic expression '在下雨' (raining) should be translated as 'it was raining' or 'there was rain'.
cultural transformation	ignoring cultural taboos or sensitivities	Ignoring cultural taboos or sensitivities in the sentence '我發現外面在下雨' (I found it was raining outside). The use of '我發現' (I found) in this context may be considered impolite or inappropriate in some cultures. A more polite or neutral expression should be used.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Did you say that the umbrella you borrowed belonged to your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你的同學亞當' as 'your classmate, Adam' instead of 'your classmate, Adam's'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
沒錯，我之前看，是亞當拿著那把雨傘，我並沒有想要偷雨傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning by stating that the speaker saw Adam holding the umbrella, instead of thinking that the umbrella they took belonged to Adam.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我之前看到，是亞當拿著那把雨傘'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember the color as well as the shape of the umbrella you borrowed?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Did you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you borrowed?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，那把傘是藍色的，不是很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
So, was the umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the question being asked in the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
我記得那把傘是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation adds unnecessary details by specifying that it was an umbrella.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Was there any person or witness can prove what you just said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
當然有，當時我看我的教授和兩個朋友一起出來。我教授也想借我傘呢。但我教授的傘太小了，我辦法拿。我不想要讓我的教授和朋友被雨淋濕。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我看我的教授和兩個朋友一起出來' should be '我和我的教授以及兩個朋友一起出來'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '我教授也想借我傘呢' should be '我教授也想借我傘給我'.

semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in the sentence: '我不想要讓我的教授和朋友被雨淋濕' should be 'I didn't want my professor to get wet'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So, those three people can go to the court as witnesses to prove what you just said. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I guess so.
我是這麼覺得。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence which you hope that the prosecutor can investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著想把傘還給陳小姐，但她不接受，我也想試著道歉，但她又不願意接受。也與我的教授還有同學可以證明我剛才所說的話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著想把傘還給陳小姐' is incorrect. It should be '我試著把傘還給陳小姐'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也想試著道歉' is incorrect. It should be '我也試著想道歉'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'prove' in the translation. The correct translation should be '也可以證明我剛才所說的話'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Okay, now the court will ask the plaintiff questions about what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject 'the court' should come before the verb 'will ask'.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it was rainy on that day. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack outside. When I came out, I found that my umbrella disappeared. I asked the personnel in the museum to help me find my umbrella. However, I later saw the defendant come to the museum with my umbrella. When I saw he held my umbrella, I was very angry and yelled why you took my umbrella. Didn’t you know that it was rainy outside? How could you do this?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	using the term 'defendant' instead of 'foreigner'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Can the court the features of your umbrella you brought on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
It was blue, very deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'very deep blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the picture on the page 5 of the investigatory file 1. Is the umbrella in the picture belonging to you?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it was my umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on the picture could be commonly bought in convenient stores. How could you assure that the umbrella was yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought my umbrella in 7-11. However, the bottom on my umbrella was broken. I could recognize my umbrella with the broken feature. As to this feature, I had made my explanations to the police. The umbrella returned by the foreigner also had the same characteristic. Therefore, I was sure that that was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'As to this feature, I had made my explanations to the police.' It should be 'I had made my explanations to the police as to this feature.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the bottom on my umbrella' should be 'the bottom of my umbrella' to accurately convey the intended meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the specific location of the damage on the umbrella, which is 'at the button' in the original text.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
The plaintiff, will you consider to settle the case if the defendant shows his regret and wants to apologize to you because it was just an umbrella?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the stolen umbrella in the translation.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it was just an umbrella? It was a common moral issue among people. If the defendant didn’t return my umbrella, I would get very wet when I went home! I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是' as 'just' instead of 'common'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'defendant' instead of 'person' as the subject of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the person's lack of basic morality in their translation.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Okay, I understand. The court will subpoena the three people that the defendant just mentioned as witnesses for the case. The next court day will be set at 3:00 p.m. on June 19th, 2014. Both the people and the defendant have to attend the court on that day. The defendant, can you make it on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Both the people and the defendant have to attend the court on that day' is incorrect. It should be 'Both the defendant and the people have to attend the court on that day.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The date 'June 19th, 2014' should be in the future tense, as the court day is scheduled for the future. It should be 'June 19th, 2014 will be set as the next court day.'

Yes, I will be here.
好的，我沒問題。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The plaintiff, you can come to the court if you want. Basically, the court will ask questions with the professor and the two classmates. You also can show up if you wanted.

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?

Later I will ask plantiff some questions about that day. Do both parties understand?

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why Ms Chen said that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'Ms Chen' instead of 'Ms Chen'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
在那天的時候,我跟我同學到博物館看展覽在我看完之後,我的兩個同學說他們餓了所以我們就想出去找東西吃,為了晚餐離開博物館的時候,發現下雨了我沒有帶傘,所以我想借我同學因為我人很高大,所以我想跟亞當借把傘他的身形跟我很像所以我就從傘架拿了一把傘我跟教授和兩個同學去買麵包當我回來的時候,陳小姐就開始對我吼叫

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of important details in translation
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	lack of appropriate level of formality in translation

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean that the umbrella you borrowed belongs to your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '當時借的傘' as 'the umbrella you borrowed' instead of 'the umbrella you borrowed at that time'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'belongs' before the subject 'the umbrella', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對阿,我以為我拿的是亞當的傘,我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you took at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you remember what color and shape the umbrella you took that day was?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得是把藍色的傘,而且沒有很新
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'brand new' as '很新', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'not a brand new one'.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我看來,的確是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '在我看來', which means 'in my opinion' or 'from my perspective', instead of '在我回憶中', which means 'in my memory' or 'from my recollection'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the adjective '藍色的' (blue), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '藍色的是' (blue is).

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone prove what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有阿,當我離開博物館,我教授跟我兩個同學跟我同在我教授甚至想借我他的傘因為他的傘太小了,我就沒跟他借我不想教授淋濕,以及其他兩位同學也是
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我就沒跟他借我不想教授淋濕'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我教授跟我兩個同學跟我同在'

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the user didn't want the professor to get wet

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So those three person can come to the court to prove what you said? Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是巴

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you want the court to investifate any other evidence for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'court' in their translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'court' and 'investigate' in their translation.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想還陳小姐傘,但他不拿,我試著道歉但他也不聽我想我的教授跟朋友可以證明我今天所說的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我想還陳小姐傘' is incorrect. It should be '我想還陳小姐的傘'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '拿' should agree with the subject '他', so it should be '他不拿' instead of '他不拿'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '聽' should agree with the subject '他', so it should be '他也不聽我' instead of '他也不聽我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'today' in the sentence '我想我的教授跟朋友可以證明我今天所說的'. It should be '我想我的教授跟朋友可以證明我今天所說的事情'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Fine, now I am going to ask Ms Chen some questions about that day.Ms Chen, can you elaborate what happened at that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yinge Ceramics Museum at that day. It was raining.When I went into Yinge Ceramics Museum, I put my umbrella in the rack.When I came out, my umbrella was gone.I asked the officer at the museum for help then I saw this foreigner holding my umbrella.When I found he took my umbrella, I was quite angry. I asked him “why you take my umbrella?”“Didn’t you realize that it was raining outside? How could you do that?”
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they asked the museum officer for help before seeing the foreigner with their umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'put' before the subject 'I' in the sentence 'When I went into Yinge Ceramics Museum, I put my umbrella in the rack.'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Do you know the color of your umbrella? Is there any special pattern?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color is your umbrella?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day was blue, dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please see the picture on page.5 of the ivestigatory file one. Is the umbrella on the picture belonging to you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'investigatory' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'belonging' instead of 'belong'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on this picture is quite common. It can buy at 7-11. How could you confrim it was yours?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'confrim' should be 'confirm'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence should be 'How could you confirm that it was yours?'

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought my umbrella at 7-11. However, my umbrella has some problem with its button.For this point, when I was at the police station, I have told the police about it.The umbrella that foreigner took has this characteristic, too.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged at the button.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Will you consider to forgive him if he is regretful and is willing to apologize since it is just a umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊的只是一把傘' as 'since it is just an umbrella', which changes the meaning of the sentence. The original text does not mention the word 'just' and the user's translation implies that the umbrella is not important, while the original text does not make that distinction.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it is “just” a umbrella? If he didn’t return my umbrella at that day, I have to walk home in rain. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'just a umbrella'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'just' before the noun 'umbrella' instead of after it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '有沒有基本道德的問題' which means 'a question of basic morality'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Okay, the court will subpeona the three people that the defendant just mentioned to explain what happened at that day. The next court date is set at 3:00 p.m. June 19th 2014. The defendant and the three witnesses have to come to the court. Defendant, is that okay?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The court will subpeona the three people that the defendant just mentioned to explain what happened at that day' is incorrect. It should be 'The court will subpeona the three people that the defendant just mentioned to explain what happened on that day.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The date 'June 19th 2014' should be in the future tense, so it should be 'June 19th, 2014' instead of 'June 19th 2014.'
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after '3:00 p.m.' to separate the time from the date.

Yes, I will be here.
知到了,我會到場
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Plantiff, it’s your choice to come or not. Basically, we are going to inquire defendant’s professor and classmates. If you want to come, it is okay.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff's name and the purpose of the inquiry.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'it’s' instead of 'you are'.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, that’s fine. If I want to come, I have to take a leave.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'If I want to come, I have to take a leave.'

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
OK. Today’s procedure ends here. Please sign on this document and you can leave.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the instruction for the person to leave the seat after signing the document.

Please answer the questions that I have mentioned so that the prosecutor will understand what happened on that day. And I will also ask the plaintiff what happened on that day, do you both understand?

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
So the defendant, where were you at 4:15 on May 27th 2014?

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff Ms. Chen?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'you' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有，當我把傘放回傘架時，陳小姐剛好就在那

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Then why did Ms. Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和一些同學一起去看一些展覽，當我們看完展覽時，我2位同學說他們餓了，所以我們決定出去買一些食物並找地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，我發現下雨了，我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟我同學借傘。因為我非常高，也有點壯，所以我決定向我的朋友Adam借傘。因為他的身形跟我比較相似。所以我就從傘架拿一把傘，然後我和我的教授去買一些麵包給我的朋友。當我回來時，陳小姐就開始對我大吼大叫。

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著把傘還給陳小姐，但他不接受，我也試著向他道歉，但他也不理我。也許我的教授和2位同學都可以幫我證明我剛剛所說的話

Now I’m going to ask Ms. Chen what happened on that day. Ms. Chen can you explain what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it rained. When I entered the museum, I put the umbrella in the umbrella rack. And when I came out, I found the umbrella was gone. I asked the working staff in the museum to help me to find my umbrella and then I just saw the foreigner just put the umbrella back to the rack. When I found that the umbrella he took was the umbrella I have lost, I was very angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside? Why did he so mean?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they asked the museum staff for help in finding the umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '沒有公德心' as 'so mean', which does not accurately convey the meaning of lacking moral integrity or consideration for others.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
So what was the color of the umbrella you brought that day? Did that have any characteristic?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella you brought that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please check the investigatory record on page 5, is the umbrella belongs to you on that picture?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，就是這把傘。

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture was very common that can be bought in 7-11, how can you make sure that umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of themselves as the owner of the umbrella.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I bought my umbrella in 7-11; however, the bottom of my umbrella was a little broken, so I cannot just… When I reported the case, I have explained to the police. The umbrella the foreigner put back has also this characteristic, so I am sure that umbrella is mine.

So if the foreigner have regretted and is also willing to apologize, do you plan to forgive him? Because you have lost is just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What does it mean it just an umbrella? The problem now is that this is an issue about the moral. If he didn’t return the umbrella, you wanted me to got wet on that day? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '只是一把傘' is translated as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'only an umbrella'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that moment?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和我的一些同學, 參觀了陶瓷博物館的一個展覽, 我們那時候已經看完展覽了, 我的兩個同學說他們餓了. 那時候我們想說去找點食物吃, 順便吃晚餐. 當我要離開陶瓷博物館的時候, 我發現外面正在下大雨. 我沒有帶雨傘, 所以打算向同學借雨傘. 因為我長得比較高大, 所以我打算跟我同學Adam借傘, 他的體型跟我差不多. 所以我就從傘架拿了一把傘, 我和我的教授去買一些麵包. 當我們回來的時候, 那時候陳小姐就開始對我們大吼大叫.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	陶瓷博物館 (ceramic museum) should be translated as Museum of Ceramics

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean at that time, the umbrella you took was Adam’s umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '同學' as 'umbrella' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的, 當我走出博物館時我的教授和兩位同學在我旁邊, 我教授甚至要借我她的雨傘, 但她的雨傘太小所以我就沒有跟她借了, 我不希望她淋濕而且那時候其他兩位同學也在
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我教授甚至要借我她的雨傘" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我教授甚至要借她的雨傘給我".

我有試著把傘還給陳小姐但她不接受, 我也試著跟她道歉但她也不接受或許我的教授和同學能證明我剛剛講的都是事實
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我有試著把傘還給陳小姐但她不接受' should be '我有試著把傘還給陳小姐，但她不接受'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我也試著跟她道歉但她也不接受' should be '我也試著跟她道歉，但她也不接受'.

That day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and it was raining. I put the umbrella in the umbrella rack when I entered the museum.

I was very angry to discover that he took my umbrella so I yelled at him and ask him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside? How could he done such thing.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture is very common, you can buy this umbrella in any convenience store like Seven-Eleven. How can you prove that this is the one that’s stolen?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Ya, it’s true, I bought my umbrella in Seven-Eleven. But my umbrella has a broken piece at its buckle so it cannot function very well. On this point, I told the police. Then the umbrella that foreinger put back has the same feature as I said. So I’m sure he took my umbrella.

If the defendant regret about the incident and want to apologize and reconcile, are you willing to settle this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by just an umbrella? If he didn’t return the umbrella, I would have to return home all wet. I don’t want to forgive hime.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just', which does not accurately convey the intended meaning of '只是' in this context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the sentence 'I don’t want to forgive hime.' It should be 'I don’t want to forgive him.'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'Why did Miss Chen say you stole her umbrella?'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
在那天，去鶯歌博物館…看展覽的時候，我是與我的同學一起去的。然後在…在後來有兩個同學講說他們其實...就是他們感覺有點餓了，然後我們就想說要出博物館去找食物吃，就解決我們的晚餐，這樣子。在我準備要離開博物館的時候，我發現說正在下雨，那我就打算跟我的同學借一把雨傘，因為我沒有帶傘這樣子。因為我長得又高又…大，所以我就想要借我同學，亞當的傘，因為他跟我的身型很類似。於是我就從雨架上拿了一把雨傘，然後跟我的教授一起出去買麵包，跟一些其他東西吃，那在我們回來的時候，我就發現陳小姐就在傘架附近，然後開始對我大吼。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Well… So what you mean is that the umbrella belonged to your friend, Adam? Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我當時真的以為我拿的是亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷別人的傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I didn't intend to steal anyone's umbrella' as '我並沒有想要偷別人的傘', which means 'I didn't want to steal someone else's umbrella'. The meaning of 'intend' was not accurately conveyed.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Well… did you… do you remember what’s the color or the shape of the umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得它的顏色，是藍色，而且不是太新的傘。

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Was the umbrella blue all over?'

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的記憶裡面，它的確是藍色的。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone clarify the statement you just said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'to' before 'be' in the sentence.

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have anything else you wish the court to investigate for you to help you with your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
在當時，我試著想要把傘還給陳小姐，但是他不願意接受，那在當時我也試著想要跟他道歉，可是他也不願意接受我的道歉，那在當時我的教授以及我兩個同學都在一旁，那他們應該可以證實我說的是真的。

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
I understand that, then the plaintiff, what happened that day. Ms. Chen, could you tell us what happened that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
At that time… on that day, I visit Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. And I put my umbrella on the rack, but I came out of the museum, I found that my umbrella was gone. I ask the staff of the museum to find the umbrella for me, and after a while, I saw the foreigner put my umbrella back on the rack. And I found out… the umbrella he returned was mine, and I was… I was furious. How could someone so shameful that knowing it was raining and he took some else umbrella?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of questioning the foreigner about why he took the umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'on that day' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user used the word 'shameful' instead of 'without public morality' to describe the foreigner's behavior.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What’s the color or some… something special about the umbrella? Could you tell us the color or anything special about the umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day was blue, and it supposed to be a dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now, I’m going to show you the investigatory file, on page 5, the pictures…the plaintiff, could you tell us, in the picture, does the umbrella belong to you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Does the umbrella in the picture belong to you?'

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
In the photo, the umbrella is very common and very ordinary, and that is the kind of umbrella you can buy in 7-11. How could you be so sure that the umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '很普通的那種' as 'very ordinary' instead of 'common'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '妳怎麼確定' which means 'how could you be sure'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, my umbrella was bought in 7-11, but the umbrella… the umbrella I brought that day, the button was a little bit broken, so it cannot be… button up. On that day, when I was making the court script, I tell the police the same thing that my umbrella… the button on my umbrella was broken, so it cannot be button up. And the umbrella the foreigner put back on the rack has the same signature… has the same characteristic.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'the umbrella… the umbrella I brought that day'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in the sentence 'the umbrella… the umbrella I brought that day'

semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of the detail that the umbrella was put back on the rack by the foreigner
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of the phrase 'has the same signature… has the same characteristic' which is not present in the original text

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Would you… forgive the defendant if the defendant show some regret and they apologize to you. Are you willing to forgive him? After all, it’s just an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by that was just an umbrella? It is an issue of morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella for me, then I have to want home without my umbrella, and it was raining on that day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '只是一把傘' is translated as 'that was just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean by that was just an umbrella'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order. The phrase 'then I have to want home without my umbrella' should be 'then I have to go home without my umbrella'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of rain in the original text. The phrase 'and it was raining on that day' is not included in the translation.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Okay… I understand. Then we will subpoena the three witness… the defendant just mentioned. And the next proceeding will set at 3 P.M… 3 o’clock in the afternoon, on June 25th, 2018. And in the next proceeding, there will be the three witness the defendant just mentioned and ask us to subpoena. The defendant… are you okay with the date?

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Ms. Chen, in the next proceeding, you can be here, or you can choose not to attend the court because, in the next proceeding, we will ask… the teacher and the classmate of the defendant to understand what’s happening on that day and to clarify the defendant’s … saying was real or not.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

The time of the incident is on May 27th, 2018. The defendant Paul Anderson went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and stole the accuser Xiaoqian Chen’s umbrella. Because the defendant Paul Anderson didn’t inform the accuser, and when the accuser returned the umbrella to the original spot, he was caught on the spot. So the accuser filed a lawsuit to the defendant Paul Anderson. In today’s procedure, the court mainly wants to understand what happened on May 27th, 2018. And we will ask the both party to clarify the situation on that day. And do the both party understand the procedure today?

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我是跟同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽，當我們看完最後一個展物的時候，其中兩個同學跟我說他們很餓，所以我們就打算出去找一些吃的，然後去吃晚餐。當時，當我要走出去覓食的時候，我發現外面下雨了。因為我沒有帶傘，所以我就想跟其中一個同學借傘。因為我長得比較高、比較大一隻，我就想跟亞登借傘，因為他的體型跟我比較像，所以我就跟他借傘。然後我就從架上拿了一把傘，我就跟我的一位教授跟其他兩位同學出去買一些麵包。那當我回來的時候我把傘歸還時，陳小姐就對我大吼了，這就是當時的狀況。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Well, so did you mean that the umbrella you borrowed belog to your friend Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using the word 'belong' instead of 'borrow'.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，當時跟我同行去買晚餐的的教授跟同學可以為我作證。當時，教授甚至有看到我借了Adam的那把傘。那是因為教授的傘比較小，我不希望身體弄濕，所以我就沒有跟她借。然後跟我同行的其他兩位同學也知道這件事。

I guess so.
是，我想應該是這樣沒錯

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Well, then I will ask the accuser to clarify the details of the incident on that day?Miss Chen, can you briefly describe what happened on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
On that day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was a rainy day, and I put my umbrella on the rack outside the museum. When I went out the museum, and I found my umbrella was gone. Then I asked the curators of the museum to help me find my umbrella, and I saw the defendant just came back and returned my umbrella to the rack. When I found out that the foreigner took my umbrella. And it was he stole my umbrella, so I was very angry and asked him why he stole my umbrella? Didn’t he know that it was raining outside ? and why he didn’t have a conscience?

cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user used 'didn't he have a conscience?' which is not a polite way to express anger in this context.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Miss Chen, what color is your umbrella? And does your umbrella have any traits?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color is your umbrella?' instead of 'Miss Chen, what color is your umbrella?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day is blue, and I think it’s deep blue.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Show exhibit evidence, page fifteen, is the picture on the file your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片' as 'Show exhibit evidence, page fifteen'. The meaning is not accurately conveyed.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user translated '請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?' as 'is the picture on the file your umbrella?'. The word order is incorrect.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
In the picture, the umbrella is just very normal one, that people can buy from 7-11.How can you confirm that umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?' as 'How can you confirm that umbrella is yours?' instead of 'How do you know that umbrella is yours?'

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, my umbrella was bought from 7-11, but in my umbrella, its button is a little bit damaged, and I cannot close my umbrella well. When I reported to the police, I had described the details of this matter. Because the umbrella that the foreigner returned to the track also had the button trait, so I can prove that the umbrella was mine.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Well, the accuser, if the defendant has regretted what he had done and apologized to you, will you forgive him? After all, the stole item is just an umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Will you forgive him if the defendant has regretted what he had done and apologized to you?'

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that just an umbrella? Is the defendant don’t have a     conscience, and what if he didn’t return the umbrella to the rack, so that I have to go back home under the big rain, you know that? So I won’t forgive him even he apoliogizes.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'just a matter of an umbrella'.

In the next proceeding, the defendant and the three witnesses will come to the proceeding and will clarify the details of the incident. Does the time of the next proceeding you can come to the court?

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'go' instead of 'went' to match the past tense of the sentence.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the user's anger in the translation.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
I should be the dark blue one.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '應該是深藍色的' as 'I should be the dark blue one', which changes the meaning of the sentence. The correct translation would be 'It should be dark blue.'

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now I’m going to show you the exhibition 1, page 5. Is the umbrella in this photo is yours?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, this is mine.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on the picture is common. It’s sold in every 711 stores. How could you say that it is yours? How did you recognize it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I bought it in 711, but …the bottom on my umbrella was broke. So that cannot be closed. I explained to the police at that time. And the umbrella that foreigner put back has this description as I said.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the information about the umbrella being damaged

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then if he is…if the defendant is regret about that and he will apologize to you, will you forget him? After all, it is an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it is just an umbrella. It’s about the moral issue. It was raining that day, so if he took the umbrella, I’ll pour in rain that day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

不用了，這樣我還要請假。

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The accused, the time was happened on May 27th 2018, and happened at Yingge Ceramics Museum.

Please answer all the questions to the prosecutor and the court for them to have more understanding of the whole incident. Do you understand? And later I will also ask the accuser to state…to all the parties…involved parties know the procedure?

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The accused, I want to ask where were you at 4:15 May 27th 2018 ?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific year (2018) in the translation.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time did you see the accuser Xiaoqian Chen…at that time?
grammar and structure	repetition	The user repeated the phrase 'at that time' unnecessarily.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的當我把傘放進傘桶後就看到她。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對著我大吼說我偷走她的傘，而我只是想告訴她我拿錯了傘，我試著道歉，但她不想聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "她對著我大吼說我偷走她的傘" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "她對著我大吼說我偷走了她的傘".
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase "我拿錯了傘" is translated as "I took the wrong umbrella" instead of "I must have taken the wrong one". The meaning is not accurately conveyed.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Miss Chen said you stole her umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我後幾位同學去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館，在參觀完一些展覽之後我們肚子就有點餓，就想出去買個食物順便找一下晚餐的吃飯的地點，當我走出去博物館時就發現正在下雨，所以我就向我的同學借一把傘，因為我的體型比較高大，所以我當時是想跟Adam(我的一個同學)借傘，因為他的體型和我比較相似，於是我傘桶拿出一把傘，並且和一位教授、兩個同學去買麵包，當我回來時，就遇到Miss Chen 在傘桶旁邊對我大吼。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '那天我後幾位同學去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館' (On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum). The correct word order should be '那天我和幾位同學去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以我就向我的同學借一把傘' (So I borrowed an umbrella from my classmates). The correct word order should be '所以我就向我的同學借了一把傘'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '因為我的體型比較高大，所以我當時是想跟Adam(我的一個同學)借傘' (Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine). The correct word order should be '因為我的體型比較高大，所以我當時想借Adam(我的一個同學)的傘'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '於是我傘桶拿出一把傘' (Then I took one umbrella from the rack). The correct word order should be '於是我拿出一把傘從傘桶裡'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '並且和一位教授、兩個同學去買麵包' (And I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends). The correct word order should be '並且和一位教授、兩個同學一起去買麵包'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '當我回來時，就遇到Miss Chen 在傘桶旁邊對我大吼' (When I came back, that's when Ms. Chen started to yell at me). The correct word order should be '當我回來時，就遇到陳小姐在傘桶旁邊對我大吼'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
What did you mean as that the umbrella is borrowed from your classmates Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the original text and translated it as borrowing the umbrella from a classmate named Adam.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的我當時認為我是借他的傘，我並沒有意圖去偷或拿走任何人的傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember the color, the shape of the umbrella you took at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得是藍色的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the item not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is that umbrella filled with blue on the surface?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我認知中，它是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '認知' which means 'cognition' or 'perception' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory' or 'remembrance'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can somebody prove what you have said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的我的教授與兩位朋友可以為我證明，我教授甚至想要借我他的傘，因為教授的傘比較小，怕會因此而淋濕，因此沒有跟他借，我當時兩位同學都在那邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我的教授與兩位朋友可以為我證明' instead of '是的我的教授與兩位朋友可以為我證明'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '證明' is incorrectly translated as 'prove' instead of 'accompany'. The correct translation should be 'My professor and two classmates can accompany me' instead of 'My professor and two classmates can prove for me'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the professor offered to lend their umbrella. The correct translation should include this detail.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds unnecessary information about the professor's umbrella being small. This detail is not mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the reason for not taking the professor's umbrella was to prevent the professor from getting wet. The correct translation should include this detail.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Then, the professor and two of your friends can come to the court to prove what you have said, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'can' should agree with the plural subject 'the professor and two of your friends'.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Then do you have any case for court to investigate for your evidence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著把傘還她，並且對她道歉，但她都無法接受，我相信我的教授與兩位朋友能夠到庭證明我的清白，還有證明我說的都是事實。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我相信我的教授與兩位朋友能夠到庭證明我的清白' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我相信我的教授與兩位朋友能夠證明我的清白到庭。'

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
I see. Now I’ll ask Miss Chen for what...for the case at that time.Miss Chen, could you explain what happend at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I visited the Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was rainy that day, so after I went into the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. When I came out of the museum, it was gone! I ask the assistance from the museum to help me to find my umbrella, but after that I saw this foreigner hold my umbrella. When I realized he was holding my umbrella, I ask him angrily why he stole my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was rainy? And didn’t he have any kind of…
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'stole' instead of 'took' to describe the action of the foreigner taking the umbrella.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'assistance' instead of 'assistance' in the sentence 'I ask the assistance from the museum'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention whether the museum staff found the umbrella or not.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's tone in questioning the foreigner's actions may be considered impolite or confrontational in some cultures.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
 What’s the color of your umbrella? And does it has any…features?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'your' before 'umbrella'.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'it' before 'has'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user's translation lacks a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day was blue. It’s dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
 Let’s look at the exhibition 1. Now you see the picture is that umbrella belong from you ?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is just very common. Everyone can buy that in 7-11, the convenience store. How could you so confidence that is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '很普通的那種' as 'just very common' instead of 'the kind that is very common'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '照片中' which means 'in the picture'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, that’s true my umbrella was brought at 7-11, but the button of my umbrella has some broken. It is hard to push it…push the button. I have explained this for the police when I was at the police station. And also, the accused… the umbrella accused at that time has this feature, so that was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'the umbrella accused'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in 'the accused... the umbrella accused'

omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'to push' after 'hard'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'the' before 'police station'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'the' before 'umbrella accused'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'that' before 'was my umbrella'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the accused is regretted about his behavior also apologize with you, could you just forget this case? In case this is just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊的只是一把傘' as 'this is just an umbrella', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'is regretted' instead of 'regrets', resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it is just an umbrella? It is a very important sense of humanity. Do you know at that day if I don’t have an umbrella, you tell me that I just walk in the rain and go home without an umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has subject-verb agreement errors.

I see, we will send the ticket to subpoena the witness for the next procedure and our procedure was set at 3:00 pm June 25th 2018. The accuser and the witness have to come to the court. The accuser, is this time available for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I will be here.
是的我到時候會出庭
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我會到時候出庭'.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, the accuser, you can…decide whether you want to come to the court next time because our next procedure was mainly to ask the witness of the accused to explain the whole situation at that time.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of classmates and teachers who were present with the accused on that day.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'to explain the whole situation at that time' in the wrong position in the sentence.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why would Ms. Chen say that you steal her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
在那天，我和我同學一起去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽，看完展覽之後，我的同學跟我說，他們有點餓，於是我們想出去買些吃的，甚至是找個地方能讓我們來吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，我發現正在下雨，而我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想說我要跟我的同學借一把傘，因為我的體型比較高大，所以我想像我的朋友Adam借傘，因為他的體型跟我差不多，於是我拿著傘和教授和兩個同學去買麵包，當我回來時，陳小姐就在那裏對我大吼。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我和我同學一起去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽' is incorrect. It should be '我和我的同學一起去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽'.

grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after '因為他的體型跟我差不多'. It should be '因為他的體型跟我差不多，於是我拿著傘和教授和兩個同學去買麵包'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Well, do you meant that the umbrella you borrowed was from your friend, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '同學' as 'friend' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我當時以為我拿的雨傘是Adam的。我並沒有想要偷別人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我以為我拿的雨傘是Adam的' instead of '我當時以為我拿的雨傘是Adam的'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Then, did you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you take at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you remember the color and shape of the umbrella that you took that day?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，那把傘是藍色的，而且不是一把很新的傘。

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the umbrella wholly in blue?

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的記憶裡，那支傘是藍色的。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anyone could verify your statement?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，當我和我的教授和兩位同學離開博物館時，我的教授還打算把他的傘借給我，而因為他的傘比較小，所以我沒有跟他借，因為我不想讓他淋濕，而我另外兩名同學也在場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '當我和我的教授和兩位同學離開博物館時' should be '當我和我的教授和兩位同學從博物館離開時'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Then, three of them could come to the court and help you verify what you just stated, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想應該是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any evidence that would like the court to help you investigate?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我嘗試把傘還給陳小姐，但他不接受，我也嘗試向陳小姐道歉，他也不接受。或許我的同學和教授能幫我證明我今天所說的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我嘗試把傘還給陳小姐" is incorrect. It should be "我嘗試把傘還給陳小姐".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我也嘗試向陳小姐道歉" is incorrect. It should be "我也嘗試向陳小姐道歉".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Ok, now I would like to ask Ms. Chen about what happened at that day. Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened at that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
At that particular day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was raining. I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack in the front door. And when I come back, the umbrella was gone. I asked the museum staff to help me find the umbrella, and I saw this foreigner put the umbrella back on the rack. When I realized the umbrella he took was mine, I was very angry；I ask him “Didn’t he know it was raining out there? Did he even has any conscious? “
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the speaker's anger and frustration.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Please describe the color and the shape of the umbrella that you brought to the museum at that day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the museum in their translation.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
Well, the umbrella I took to the museum was blue. I believe it was in the deep blue color.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now, I would like to show Exhibit 1 page 5. Is the umbrella on this picture yours?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'show' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '偵卷' as 'Exhibit' instead of 'page'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '照片' as 'picture' instead of 'photo'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '妳的' as 'yours' instead of 'mine'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is merely a regular umbrella. It is the kind of umbrella that you could easily get in a 7-11 store. How could you be so sure that this is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '很普通的那種' as 'merely a regular umbrella' instead of 'a very ordinary one'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?' which asks how the speaker is certain that the umbrella belongs to them.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, of course, I bought my umbrella at 7-11 store. However, the button of my umbrella is a little bit broken so that it cannot be packed properly. I explain this point to the Police specifically at that time, and the umbrella that the foreigner put back on the rack matched the description. So I believed that was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'I explain this point to the Police specifically at that time' should be 'I specifically explain this point to the Police at that time'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then, if the defendant has showed remorse and apologize to you. Would you be willing to forgive him? Because it is merely an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by using the word 'defendant' instead of 'opposite party'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error by using 'has' instead of 'have'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the opposite party's willingness to apologize.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the opposite party's remorse.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user's possibility of forgiving the opposite party.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the stolen item being an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it is only an umbrella? I think this is a basic moral issue. If he didn’t return the umbrella, how would I be able to go home? What? Did he want me to go home under pouring rain?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'only', which changes the meaning of the sentence. The correct translation should be 'what do you mean'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'he didn’t return' instead of 'he didn't return'. The verb 'didn't' should be contracted with 'he'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'I think' in the translation, which changes the tone and meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'What?' in the translation, which is an important part of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Well, I understand. We will subpoena the three of the witnesses of the case. Next court proceeding will set on June 25th 2018 at 3:00 P.M. Three of the witnesses and the defendant must come to the court. Is the date ok for the defendant?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect date

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會出庭。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Ms. Chen, the next court proceeding, you could come or not because the main procedure is about asking questions to the three witnesses.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the witnesses being classmates and teachers who were present with the defendant.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not needing to come.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟我的兩位同學去看展覽，在我們看完以後，我同學他們覺得很餓，所以我想說我們去買些食物，找個地方來吃晚餐。當我們要離開博物館時，外面正在下雨，我當時沒有帶雨傘，我就跟我同學借一把。因為我有點身材有點高大，所以我跟我同學亞當借雨傘，因為他的體身形比較寬，跟我比較相似。於是我從雨傘架上拿了雨傘，我去幫我教授們買了麵包，我回來之後就看到陳小姐對著我大叫。

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想要把雨傘還給陳小姐，但她並不接受。我也想要跟她道歉，但她也不領情。我想我的教授跟我的兩位同學可以幫我做證吧。

Ok, so I would like to ask Mrs. Chen what happened on that day. Mrs. Chen, could you tell me what happened on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
 I went Yingee Ceramics Museum that day, it was raining, so I put my umbrella in the rack. After I came out, my umbrella was gone. I ask the janitor of the museum to help me find it. But after I saw this foreigner, and I saw my umbrella. When I discovered that my umbrella was taken by him, I was so angry. I ask him why did you take my umbrella? Do you know it’s raining outside now? How can you behave like this? Do you have any moral ethics?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	鶯歌博物館 (Yingee Ceramics Museum) should be translated as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in 'I ask the janitor of the museum to help me find it' should be 'I ask the museum janitor to help me find it'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the umbrella was stolen
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the user confronted the foreigner about taking the umbrella
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention the user's anger and questioning of the foreigner's behavior
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention the user's questioning of the foreigner's moral ethics

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What’s the color of your umbrella, and did it have any special features?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day is blue, I guess it’s a dark blue umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '應該是深藍色的' as 'I guess it’s a dark blue umbrella', which doesn't accurately convey the meaning of '應該' (should).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please show the exhibit one. Mrs. Chen, is that the umbrella you brought that day?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the exhibit number and the page number.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'show' before the noun phrase 'the exhibit one', which is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'Mrs. Chen' instead of '妳' (you), which is a mismatched translation.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it was the umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture was just a common one. And you can buy it form anywhere like 7-11. How can you be so sure that it was yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
That’s true, that was the umbrella I bought from 7-11, and there are some damages around the button on the umbrella. At that time, I told the police about the damage on the button, and it was put on the rack, after which was taken by this guy.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was put back on the rack before being taken by the foreigner.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then, if the other party would like to apologize, and he knew that he was wrong. Could you forgive him since it was just an umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. The original text asks if the speaker would be able to forgive the other person, while the user's translation assumes that the speaker is asking if the interpreter would be able to forgive the other person.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What did you mean that it’s just an umbrella? Do you know that what the situation was? It’s raining big outside. Did you want to go back home without any umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the meaning of '只是' (just)

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Oh, I see. Well, I will send the subpoena to the three witness, and the next proceeding will be set at 3:00p.m., june 25th, 2018. The defendant and three witness will come to the court. The defendant, is the date ok with you?

Mrs, Chen, you can either show up or not on that day since we are going to ask three witnesses about what happened that day.

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The incident happened on May 27th, 2018. The defendant Paul Anderson took Xiao-Cian Chen’s umbrella at Yingge Ceramics Museum. The defendant did not inform the accuser of taking her umbrella. When the defendant returned the umbrella to Xiao-Cian Chen, she caught the defendant on spot.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The defendant, where were you at 4:15p on May 27th, 2018?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you the accuser Xiao-Cian Chen on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see the accuser Xiao-Cian Chen on that day?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是，當我把雨傘放回去的時候，原告陳小倩在場。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'was' should agree with the subject 'Ms. Chen', so it should be 'Ms. Chen was there.'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened on that day?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她當時大叫說我偷了她的雨傘，但我只是錯拿了雨傘而已。我有試著要道歉，但她不願意聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "但我只是錯拿了雨傘而已" is incorrect. It should be "但我只是錯拿了雨傘而已，並沒有偷走。"

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did the accuser said you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'accuser' was used instead of '陳小姐' (Miss Chen).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和同學們去看展覽，看完展覽後有兩個同學說肚子餓了，我們決定去買晚餐，或是找個地方坐下來吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，發現下大雨了，我原本想和我的同學借傘。因為我的個子比較高、比較大隻，所以我決定和我的同學亞當借傘，他的身形和我比較像。我就從架子裡面拿了傘，然後和其他人去買麵包，當我回來的時候，原告陳小姐就對我大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我和同學們去看展覽' should be '我和同學們去看展覽' instead of '我和同學們去看展覽'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '去買晚餐' should agree with the subject '我們' and be '去買晚餐' instead of '去買晚餐'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '當我回來的時候' should be in the past tense and be '當我回來的時候' instead of '當我回來的時候'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '麵包' should be translated as '食物' instead of '麵包'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean the umbrella you borrowed at the time belongs to your classmate Adam.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the umbrella belongs to the classmate, while the original text only mentions that the umbrella was borrowed from the classmate.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對我以為我拿的雨傘是亞當的，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember what’s the color and pattern of the umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色是藍色的，然後不是很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the car not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
The whole umbrella is blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的記憶裡，它是藍色的。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anyone can prove what you just stated is true?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有，當我出來的時候，我的教授和兩位同學都在，我教授原本還想要幫我撐傘，但是我覺得教授的傘太小了，我也不想要教授淋濕，其他兩位同學也在場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我的教授和兩位同學都在' instead of '我教授和兩位同學都在'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '撐傘' is not the correct word choice for 'lend me her umbrella'. The correct word should be '借給我她的傘'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the professor offered to lend the umbrella. This detail is important for understanding the context.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three people can come to the court and prove what you stated is true, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any other evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
當時我試著要還她傘，但她不願意拿；當時我也試著要道歉，但她不願意接受，我相信我的教授和兩位同學，都可以證明我所述為實。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我相信我的教授和兩位同學，都可以證明我所述為實' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我相信我的教授和兩位同學都可以證明我所述為實。'

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Then I am going to ask Ms. Chen about what happened on that day.Ms. Chen could you describe the situation on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened on that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day. It was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack and when I get back, it was gone. I asked the workers in the museum to find for me and the foreigner just took the umbrella back. When I saw my umbrella in his hand, I was really angry. I asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining on that day? How could he do such an immoral thing?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'get' instead of 'got' in the sentence 'When I get back, it was gone.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊' as 'gone' instead of 'stolen'.
inappropriate cultural transformation	ignoring cultural taboos or sensitivities	The user used the term 'immoral' to describe the foreigner's action, which may not be culturally appropriate.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What the color of the umbrella you took with you on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I took on that day was blue, dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Exbit1. Page5. The picture of the umbrella. Does the umbrella belong to you ?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'exhibit' which is important for understanding the context.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'belong' instead of 'belongs' to match the subject 'umbrella'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s exactly my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
It’s a really normal umbrella. It’s sold at 7-11. How can you be so sure that it’s your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought this umbrella at 7-11. But my umbrella has some problems at the button. It’s kind of broken. It cannot really buckle up. When I reported this case, I did emphasize this to the police officers. And the umbrella he put back on the rack has this characteristic too.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged at the button.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'kind of broken' in an incorrect position.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was put back on the rack by a foreigner.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella has a specific characteristic that matches the user's umbrella.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant does show his regret and he apologizes sincerely. Would you consider forgiving him? Since it’s just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by it’s just an umbrella? It’s an immoral thing. If he did not return the umbrella back, then I would have to get wet in the rain.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '只是一把傘' is translated as 'it's just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean by it's just an umbrella?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' is translated as 'if he did not return the umbrella back' instead of 'if he did not return it that day.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of '這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題' which means 'it's a question of whether a person has basic morals.'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Ok, I understand. Then I would send subpoena to the three people just mentioned. The next proceeding is at 3:00pm on June 25th, 2018. The defendant and there witnesses have to come to the court. Is the date fine with you, the defendant?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I will be here.
是的我會到庭。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
About the accuser, Ms. Chen, the next proceeding you can be here or you can choose not to come here. The next proceeding is mainly about asking the three witnesses about the defendant’s statement. You can choose to come or not to come.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the three witnesses who will be asked about the defendant's statement.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the accuser's presence being optional.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, or I need to take another leave.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
And at that time did you see the accuser, Miss Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把雨傘還回去時，陳小姐就在那裡。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐就在那裡，當我把雨傘還回去時。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大叫並說我偷了她的雨傘，當時的我只想解釋，我並沒有偷她的傘，我只是拿錯把。我嘗試向她道歉，但她不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '當時的我只想解釋' should be '我當時只想解釋'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和同學一起去看鶯歌陶瓷博物館的展覽。當我們看完那些物品之後，他們說覺得很餓，想要買食物來吃，所以我們想找個地方用晚餐。當我離開的時候，卻發現已經在下雨了。然後我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想跟同學借一把，我想要和我一位叫做Adam的朋友借雨傘，他的身型跟我的很像。所以我從架上拿一把傘然後跑去找我的教授跟朋友。當我回去的時候，陳小姐就在那裡。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
So is that umbrella belonging to your friend, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我以為那把傘是亞當的。我並沒有打算要偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我以為那把傘是亞當的' instead of '我以為那把傘是亞當的。'

是的，當時我的教授跟同學都可以證明這件事，我的教授甚至要借我一把傘。因為教授的傘很小一把，我不想要讓她淋濕，而且當時也還有同學在場。

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
I supposed that these three classmates can come to the court and prove what you’ve said, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

事情發生的時候，我想要把雨傘還回去然後跟她道歉但她不聽。也許我的同學跟教授可以證明我說的都是事實，

I see. Now I’m going to ask questions to Miss Chen to understand what happed at that day.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
Miss Chen, could you tell me that what happened that day? I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day. And… it rained at that time. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack. And when I was out, it was missing. I asked the staff in museum to find my umbrella for me. And then I saw this foreigner put my umbrella back. When I found my stolen umbrella, I was super angry. And I ask that why did he take my umbrella. Don’t you…know that there is raining outside?

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought at that day is blue. I think it’s dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '藍色的' as 'blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Now we look at Exhibit one, page five. The picture on it. Is that umbrella yours?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is that umbrella yours?' instead of 'That umbrella is yours?'

對，就是這把傘。
null

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
This umbrella is normal. Everybody can buy it in 7-11 convenient store. How did you make sure that it is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '很普通的那種' as 'normal', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '普通' in this context.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question word '怎麼' which is crucial for understanding the question being asked.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed I bought that umbrella in 7-11 convenient store. But my umbrella, the button is broken. It’s not work well. I talked to the police on this point especially and this umbrella’s button is broken. So I could make sure that is my umbrella.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the broken button when talking to the police, which is an important detail in the original text.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant shows his regretness and he is willing to apologize to you, would you forgive him? It’s just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
How could you say that it just an umbrella? It is the principle of merit. It rained heavily outside. If he did not put the umbrella back, I would get wet. I won’t forgive him. Ever.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'it's the principle of merit'.

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?

Today we are mainly going to clarify what happened that day, so please answer the questions I ask so the prosecutors can understand what actually happened that day. Understand?

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen?

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
有，我把雨傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐就在那裏。

當時發生了什麼事呢?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著解釋我應該是拿錯傘了' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試著解釋我應該拿錯了傘'.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'her' instead of 'Miss Chen'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'say' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和幾個同學到博物館看展覽，看完展覽之後，有些人說他餓了，所以我們決定出去買些吃的，也順便找在哪裡吃晚餐。要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了，但是我沒有帶傘，所以我決定要跟同學借一把傘。因為我身形比較高大一點，所以我決定跟我的同學，他叫亞當，我決定跟他借傘，因為他的身形跟我差不多。所以我從傘架上拿了把傘，然後出去買麵包，跟我的教授和兩位朋友一起，而當我走回去傘架的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大叫。

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean the umbrella you borrowed is from your friend, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '亞當' as 'Adam' instead of 'friend'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我以為那把傘就是亞當的，我並無意偷別人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Then did you remember what color the umbrella you took was?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得它是…我只記得它的顏色，藍色，而且沒有很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not being a brand new one.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
The whole umbrella is blue?

In my recollection, the color was blue.
我印象中傘是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the noun '藍色' (blue color), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '藍色的傘' (blue umbrella).

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有的，我走出博物館的時候，一位教授和兩位同學都在我旁邊，教授甚至還想借我她的傘，但是教授的傘比較小，所以我沒有跟她借，我不想讓教授淋濕，其他兩位朋友在旁邊也有看到。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我走出博物館的時候，一位教授和兩位同學都在我旁邊'.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想可以吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any evidence that you want the prosecutor offices to investigate for you?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我當時試著把傘還給陳小姐，她不接受。我試著跟她道歉，她也不聽。我想我的教授和兩位同學應該可以到庭作證我說的都是事實。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我試著跟她道歉，她也不聽'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Ok. Next, I am going to ask Ms. Chen about what happened that day. Ms. Chen, can you describe what had happened that day?

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is an ordinary one. You can get it in a convenience store. How can you determine that it was your umbrella.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the part about the umbrella being the same kind that can be bought at 7-11.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought it at seven-eleven, but the button of my umbrella is a little broken. When I report the case to the police, I have explained this point. And the umbrella which the foreign returned back to the rack has the same feature. From this, we can know that it was my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And the umbrella which the foreign returned back to the rack has the same feature.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged near the button.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context that the umbrella was reported to the police.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外國人' as 'the foreign', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '報案' as 'report the case', which is not the most accurate translation. It should be 'report to the police'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '特徵' as 'feature', which is not the most accurate translation. It should be 'characteristic' or 'trait'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the defendant regrets it and is willing to apologize, would you forgive him? After all, it was just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by it was just an umbrella? It’s about moral. If he didn’t return the umbrella back, I would have to go home in the heavy rain! I wouldn’t forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'it was just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean by it was just an umbrella'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'What do you mean by it was just an umbrella?' instead of 'What do you mean by it was just an umbrella?'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' which means 'if he didn't return it that day'.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Oh…ok. Then the court will subpoena the defendant’s professor and the two friends. The next proceeding is set to be at 3 p.m., June 25th, 2018. The defendant and the three witness should be appear in the court…should appear in the court. Defendant, would this date be ok?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'should appear in the court'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of sending subpoenas to the three individuals mentioned by the defendant.

Yes, I will be here.
可以，我會到庭。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The plaintiff, the next proceeding, you can either come or not come. Next time we will mainly ask the defendant and his professor and two classmates, so either you come or not is ok.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Next time we will mainly ask the defendant and his professor and two classmates, so it is ok whether you come or not.'

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
Then I won’t come. I would have to take a day-off if I come.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not coming in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user added the phrase 'I won't come' which is not present in the original text.

25th floor no.4 …no.132 學府Road Sanxia District 新北 City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The defendant Paul Anderson, on the date of May 27th 2018, in the location is Yingge ceramics museum, you were found to take the accuser, 陳小倩 小倩陳’s umbrella, and you didn’t tell her that you took the umbrella, and umm when you returned the umbrella, umm 陳小倩 found you and her umbrella, so she decided to sue you.

The defendant and the accuser please answer questions to help us clarify the situation on that day. Do the both parties understand? After that, I will ask the accuser about some details on that day. Do the both parties understand today’s procedure?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (took the accuser, 陳小倩 小倩陳’s umbrella)

I understand.
我了解

我了解。
I understand

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The defendant, on the date may 27, 2018, at 4:15 pm, where were you at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At the time, did you see the accuser Miss Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see Miss Chen, the accuser, at the time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的, 當我把雨傘放回傘架, 陳小姐在場

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對我大吼, 說我偷了她的雨傘, 我告訴她我可能我一定是拿錯了雨傘, 我並沒有要偷她的傘, 我嘗試向她道歉, 但她不肯聽
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我可能我一定是拿錯了雨傘" is incorrect. It should be "我可能是拿錯了雨傘".
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb "偷" should agree with the subject "我", so it should be "我沒有偷她的傘" instead of "我並沒有要偷她的傘".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb "拿" should be in the past tense to match the context, so it should be "我可能拿錯了雨傘" instead of "我可能是拿錯了雨傘".
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after "我嘗試向她道歉" to separate it from the following clause.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Miss Chen say that you steal her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
我當時和我的同學在逛鶯歌陶瓷博物館, 在看展覽, 在看了一些展覽品之後, 我的同學告訴我說他們肚子餓了, 所以我們想要出去買一些食物, 然後找個地方吃晚餐, 當我們正要離開的時候, 我意識到已經下雨了, 但我沒有帶雨傘,所以我像我的同學借了把傘, 因為我長得又高又大, 所以我決定借一把傘和我的體型比較相似的, 然後我就跟我的同學艾登借了把傘, 因為她跟我的體型最接近,
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我當時和我的同學在逛鶯歌陶瓷博物館' should be '我和我的同學當時在逛鶯歌陶瓷博物館'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '在看了一些展覽品之後' should be '在看了一些展覽品後'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我意識到已經下雨了' should be '我意識到已經下雨了'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '但我沒有帶雨傘' should be '但我沒有帶傘子'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '所以我像我的同學借了把傘' should be '所以我向我的同學借了把傘'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '因為我長得又高又大' should be '因為我又高又大'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '所以我決定借一把傘和我的體型比較相似的' should be '所以我決定借一把和我體型比較相似的傘'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '然後我就跟我的同學艾登借了把傘' should be '然後我就跟我的同學艾登借了把傘'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You are saying that the umbrella which you borrowed is from your friend, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '同學' as 'friend' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的, 我當時認為我借的傘就是我朋友艾登的, 並沒有要偷傘的意圖
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation incorrectly assumes the name 'Adam' is translated as '艾登' in Chinese, which is not a common Chinese name. The cultural transformation is inappropriate.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Then, do you so you still remember the color and the shape of the umbrella which you borrowed?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得那把傘的顏色, 它是藍色的, 但不是全新的一把傘
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '的一把傘' at the end of the sentence instead of after '藍色'.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is that umbrella was whole blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'was' is used instead of 'is', changing the tense and meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is that umbrella whole blue?' or 'Is that umbrella all blue?'

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的回憶裡, 它是藍色的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '在我的回憶裡', which means 'in my memory', but the original text means 'according to my memory'.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is that anyone who can prove that what you were saying was ….is true?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的, 當我走出博物館的時後, 我的教授和另外兩個同學就在我的身旁, 我的教授甚至提議要借我她的雨傘, 因為她的傘太小了, 所以我就沒有和她借傘, 因為我也不希望她淋濕, 然樓另外兩個同學也和我在一起
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '當我走出博物館的時後' should be '當我走出博物館的時候'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So, these three people…can they can come to the court and be your evidence to prove what you said was right, can they?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I guess so.
我想是吧

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Then do you what any evidence that want the prosecutor to help you investigate on your behalf?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我嘗試要歸還那把雨傘, 但是這個陳小姐不肯接受, 我嘗試道歉, 但這位陳小姐不想聽, 也許我的教授和我的同學可以證明我所說的都是真的
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我嘗試要歸還那把雨傘' should be '我嘗試歸還那把雨傘'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我嘗試道歉' should be '我嘗試向她道歉'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '但這位陳小姐不想聽' should be '但這位陳小姐不想聽我'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '也許我的教授和我的同學可以證明我所說的都是真的' should be '也許我的教授和我的同學可以證明我今天所說的都是真的'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Now I am going to ask Miss Chen the details on that day. Miss Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. I put the umbrella on the rack. and.. After I want to take my umbrella, it was gone. I asked the staff of the museum to help me find the umbrella, and I found this foreigner put my umbrella back to the rack. When I realized the umbrella which he took was mine, I was really angry, and I asked him why he took my umbrella, didn’t he know that it is raining outside?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part where the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'want' instead of 'went' in the sentence 'After I want to take my umbrella'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '鶯歌博物館' as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' instead of 'Yingge Museum'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'and' at the beginning of the sentence 'and.. After I want to take my umbrella, it was gone.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the part where the user asked the museum staff to help find the umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the user's anger in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the user's question to the foreigner about why he took the umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the user's comment about the foreigner's lack of public morality.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Miss Chen do do you wtill remember the color of your umbrella? Does it have any particular part?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'do' should agree with the subject 'Miss Chen', so it should be 'Does Miss Chen'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Do you still remember'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella which I brought that day I think id blue, and it’s dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '應該是深藍色的' as 'and it’s dark blue', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '應該' (should).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Show the evidence on the investigatory file P.5. Is this umbrellas yours?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'evidence' in their translation.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is my umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '這把傘' as 'my umbrella' instead of 'this umbrella'.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
In the photo, the umbrellas is quite ordinary one, which can easily get in 7-11. How do you ensure that this is yours?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '照片中這把傘是很普通的那種' as 'In the photo, the umbrellas is quite ordinary one'. The correct translation should be 'In the photo, this umbrella is the ordinary kind.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'is' before the subject 'umbrellas' in the sentence 'the umbrellas is quite ordinary one'. The correct word order should be 'the umbrella is'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, my umbrellas was bought at 7-11, but the button of my umbrellas was broken. Umm um, it can not umm bottom up. At this point…umm on this point, when I report to the police, I have told the police um what my umbrellas look like, and the umbrella which the foreigner put back has the same same ….specialty.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'the umbrella which the foreigner put back has the same same ….specialty' does not make sense in English.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
The accuser, if the other party feels regret, and want to apologize, could you accept his apology? Since this incident is quite small.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it is just an umbrella? It’s a problem related to ethics. If the one he didn’t return my umbrella, I would have to umm I would have to walk without umbrella in the raining day, and I will get wet.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
Ok, I understand. The court is dismiss. Please sign the court script before you leave this court.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum, and I found that it was raining outside. When I get into the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. And then when I came out of the museum, I found that my umbrella disappeared. I ask the staff of the museum help me to find my umbrella, but when I went out of the museum, I found that there was a foreigner putting my umbrella back.When I found that it is the foreigner that took away my umbrella, I was mad.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

對，就是這把傘。

The umbrella in this picture is very ordinary. It is the kind of umbrella that you can buy in 7-11. How can you be sure that it is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the part about the speaker's ownership of the umbrella.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。

Ms. Chen, if the defendant have the sincerity of regression, and he is willing to apologize to you, then would you accept his apology? After all, it is just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it is an umbrella? I think that it is about a person’s basic moral. If I didn’t have a umbrella that day, that means I’m going to be wet on that big raining day. I don’t want to accept his apology.

Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的印象中，雨傘是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'color' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

Can anyone verify what you stated?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，當我一走出陶瓷博物館之後，我的教授還有其他兩個學生都有看到。我的教授甚至問我需不需要借他的傘。但因為教授的傘太小了，我並沒有向他借傘，我不想要他淋濕。當時其他的兩位同學都在。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我的教授還有其他兩個學生都有看到' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我的教授和其他兩個學生都看到了'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor offered to lend their umbrella. The correct translation should include this detail.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the unnecessary information '問我需不需要借他的傘'. The correct translation should be '問我需不需要借她的傘' to match the gender of the professor.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Could the three of them verify your statement?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想應該可以。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence you want the prosecutor to investigate?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我嘗試要還傘給他，但他拒絕了。我嘗試向他道歉，但他也不聽。或許我的教授和朋友能夠作證，他們會支持我的說法。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence should be '我嘗試還傘給她' instead of '我嘗試要還傘給他'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Now I would like to ask the accuser Xiao-Chiang Chen some questions. Ms. Chen, can you stated what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Museum at that day, and it was raining, so I put my umbrella in the rack. However, when I came out of the museum, I could not find my umbrella. I asked the museum staff to help me find my umbrella. After that, I saw a foreigner took my umbrella. When I realized that he took my umbrella, I was very angry, so I asked him “Do you know it is raining outside? Why did you take my umbrella? Don’t you have any sympathy?”
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'I went to Yingge Museum at that day' is incorrect. It should be 'I went to Yingge Museum that day'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the umbrella was stolen. Instead, it states that the foreigner 'took' the umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the user's question about why the foreigner took the umbrella and their comment about the lack of sympathy.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What is the color of the umbrella? Is there any special feature on your umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color is your umbrella?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day is blue. I think it is dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Show investigatory file 1 page 5. There is a picture on this page. Is this your umbrella?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '提示' as 'show' instead of 'refer to' or 'look at'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'is' before the subject 'the picture', resulting in incorrect word order.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture is really common. It is the umbrella you could buy in 7-11. How can you know that this is the umbrella that you brought?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '妳的' as 'that you brought' instead of 'yours'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, the umbrella I brought is from 7-11. However, the button of my umbrella is a bit broken. When I filed the case, I have specifically told the police about this point. The umbrella the foreigner took also has the same feature.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged at the button.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the accused seems to be genuinely regretful and apologize to you, will you accept his apology since this is just an umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that this is just an umbrella? This is something about basic moral ethics. If he did not return my umbrella, do I have to walk home all wet? I do not want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just' instead of 'something about'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'this is' before 'something about' instead of after
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'if he did not return my umbrella'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I see. We will subpoena the three witnesses, the two students and the professors, to state the details of the incident. The next proceedings will be at 3 pm on June 25th, 2018. The accused and the three witnesses will attend the court. The accused, is this time available for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The accused and the three witnesses will attend the court.'

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我可以到庭。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss. Chen, it is up to you whether you want to come to the court for the next proceedings. The purpose for the next proceedings is to ask the three witnesses about the incidents.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the witnesses being classmates and teachers who were present with the defendant.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
I will not come to the next proceedings since I will have to take a day off for my work.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for needing to take a day off.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

新北市三峽區學府路132號5樓之4
25F.-4, No.132, Xuefu Rd., Sanxia Dist., New Taipei City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The defendant, Paul Anderson, you are prosecuted of a stealing case. The time was 5/27 in 2018. The location was Yingge Ceramics Museum. On that day, you took the accuser, Xiao-Qian, Chen’s umbrella. However, you didn’t tell him. After that, you turned back the umbrella. And Xiao-Qian, Chen found you and the umbrella. So, you are prosecuted. Today we are going to understand what happened on that day. So, please answer the question based on our question. Understand? Afterwards, I will also ask some questions for the accuser. So, do both parties understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (took the accuser, Xiao-Qian, Chen’s umbrella) should be translated as 借了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (borrowed the accuser, Xiao-Qian, Chen’s umbrella)
omission or addition	omitting important details	因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下 (because you didn’t tell him) is omitted in the translation

I understand.
是的，我了解。

我了解。
I understand.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The defendant, where were you at 4:15 P.M. on 5/27 in 2018?

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you see the accuser, Ms. Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you see Ms. Chen, the accuser, at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把傘還回傘架的時候，陳小姐在那邊。

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
當時她朝著我吼叫，說我偷了她的傘，但是我嘗試著解釋，我只是拿錯傘，不是偷她的傘，我想要道歉，想要解釋，但是她都不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'yelled' is translated as '吼叫' which has a stronger connotation than 'yelled'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker tried to apologize.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Ms. Chen consider you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐會說' as 'consider' instead of 'say'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽，然後看完展覽之後，我跟我兩個同行的朋友就說肚子很餓，想要出去找一些食物吃，但是當我們要走出博物館的時候，才發現突然下雨了，但是我身上又沒有帶傘，然後打算向我朋友借一把，因為我身材比較高大，所以我決定跟我朋友亞當借傘，因為他身形跟我類似，於是，我就從傘架上拿了那一支傘，然後想說待會買一點東西，馬上就歸還，當我回到現場的時候，陳小姐就對著我吼叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '然後看完展覽之後' is incorrect. It should be '然後我們看完展覽之後'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '說' should agree with the subject '我們', so it should be '我們說肚子很餓' instead of '我說肚子很餓'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '想要' should be in the past tense to match the context, so it should be '想要出去找一些食物吃' instead of '想要出去找一些食物吃'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun '我們' is missing in the sentence '但是當要走出博物館的時候'. It should be '但是當我們要走出博物館的時候'.
grammar and structure	preposition errors	The preposition '向' should be '跟' in the sentence '然後打算向我朋友借一把'. It should be '然後打算跟我朋友借一把'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after '然後想說待會買一點東西' to separate it from the following clause.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
So, do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed at that time was your classmate’s, Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我以為我當時借的傘就是亞當的，我根本並沒有想要去拿別人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為我借的傘就是亞當的'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember what was the color and the shape of the umbrella you borrowed that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，蠻舊的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the car not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the umbrella all blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的印象當中，它是藍色的沒錯。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation adds the phrase '沒錯' which means 'correct' or 'right'. This addition changes the meaning of the sentence and implies that the color being blue is a correct or accurate statement, which is not conveyed in the original text.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is anyone can prove your words you just said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，當那天走出來的時候，教授和其他兩個同學都在場，教授甚至說要借我傘，但是那把傘好像太小了，所以我就跟她講，可能要向另外一個同學借傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我就跟她講，可能要向另外一個同學借傘' is incorrect. It should be '我就跟她說，可能要向另外一個同學借傘'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the professor's umbrella was small, which is mentioned in the original text.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So, the three people can be court to prove what you just said, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I guess so.
是的。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
So, do you have any evidence you want the police to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我想要把傘還給陳小姐，但是她都不接受，我也想誠心地跟她道歉，但是她也都不聽，我想我的教授跟其他兩位同學應該能替我作證吧。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我想要把傘還給陳小姐' (I want to return the umbrella to Ms. Chen). The correct word order should be '我想把傘還給陳小姐'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我也想誠心地跟她道歉' (I also want to sincerely apologize to her). The correct word order should be '我也想跟她誠心地道歉'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'today' in the sentence '我想我的教授跟其他兩位同學應該能替我作證吧' (I think my professor and two other classmates should be able to testify for me today).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'what' in the sentence '我想我的教授跟其他兩位同學應該能替我作證吧' (I think my professor and two other classmates should be able to testify for what I have said today).

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK, now I am going to ask some details to Ms. Chen on that day.Ms. Chen, could you elaborate what happened on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Could you elaborate on what happened on that day?'

That day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. However, it was rainy. So, when I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack. However, when I wanted to leave, I found my umbrella gone. I asked the museum staff to help me, at the same time, I found the foreign turn my umbrella back. When I realized that the umbrella he took was my umbrella, I was really angry. Did he know it was rainy? So, how could he take my umbrella away?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '鶯歌博物館' as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' instead of 'Yingge Museum'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'the foreign' before 'turn my umbrella back' instead of 'the foreigner turned my umbrella back'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part where the speaker asked the foreigner why he took the umbrella.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What’s the color or other features of the umbrella you brought that day?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjectives 'dark' and 'blue' in the wrong order.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Show the evidence 1, page 5. In the picture, is your umbrella?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'this' before 'picture', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'is' instead of 'are' to agree with the plural noun 'umbrella'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is very common. It can be found in every convenience store. How could you make sure the umbrella is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the umbrella can be found in every convenience store, while the original text does not mention this.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, I bought my umbrella in 7-11 convenience store. However, the button of my umbrella is kind of broken. So, I can make sure that’s my umbrella. At that time, I said to the police, and the umbrella the foreign turned back the button of the umbrella was also broken. So, I can make sure he stole my umbrella.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? It’s a matter of our values and moral. On that day, if he didn’t turn back my umbrella, so do you want me to go home without umbrella? I didn’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'it's just an umbrella' instead of 'what do you mean it's just an umbrella'.

25th floor, No.132, Xuefu Road, Sanxia District, New Taipei City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The incident happened at May 27th ,2018. The defendant Paul Anderson stole the umbrella of the accuser, Xiao-Chien Chen. You didn’t ask whether you can borrow the umbrella or not, and when you put the umbrella back, the accuser caught you red-handed. Today’s procedure is to clarify the details happened that day. Please answer my questions according to my saying. Do both parties understand? Later, I will also ask the accuser the details of this case. Do both parties understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the date as 'May 27th, 2018' instead of 'May 27th, 103'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the defendant took the umbrella without asking.

I understand.
我了解。

我了解。
I understand.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The defendant, where were you at 4:15pm on May 27th , 2018?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you see the accuser, Ms. Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you see Ms. Chen, the accuser, at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把雨傘還回架上後，陳小姐就在那邊了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐就在那邊了' instead of '就在那邊了陳小姐'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened then?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她站在那邊對我大叫，說我偷了她的傘，我告訴她我只是不小心拿錯而已。我沒有偷。我試著向她道歉，但她不接受。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '她站在那邊對我大叫' is incorrect. It should be '她對我大叫站在那邊'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我只是不小心拿錯而已' is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as 'I just accidentally took the wrong one.'

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Ms. Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed then was from your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '亞當' as 'Adam' instead of 'classmate, Adam'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的。我以為當時那把傘是我同學亞當斯的。我並沒有意圖要偷那個傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'steal' was translated as '偷' which means 'to steal' in Chinese, but in this context, it should be translated as '拿' which means 'to take'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Could you recall the color of the umbrella you took then?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色而已。是藍色的然後沒有很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the item not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Was the umbrella all blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我印象中是藍色的沒錯。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' before the adjective '藍色' instead of after it.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone proof what you just said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，可以。當時我和我的教授和兩位朋友離開博物館時，我教授甚至還問我要不要借我雨傘，因為她雨傘太小，我就不打算跟她借了。我不想要她淋濕。我那兩位同學當時也在場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我教授甚至還問我要不要借我雨傘' should be '我教授甚至還問我要不要借她的雨傘'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
I assume that the three of them can come to the court and clarify your statement, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate on your behalf?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我當時試著還給她雨傘，她不收。我跟她道歉，她也不接受。我想我的教授們跟兩位同學都能幫我做證這點。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我想我的教授們跟兩位同學都能幫我做證這點'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
I see. Now I’m going to ask Ms. Chen what happened that day.Ms. Chen, can you tell me what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Can you tell me what happened that day, Ms. Chen?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day. It was raining outside. So when I enterd the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack, and then I found out it was gone. I asked the members of the museum to help me find my umbrella. I found out that this foreigner took my umbrella. I realized the umbrella he was taking is the one I lost. I was very angry. How could anyone do such thing when they know it was raining outside?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out critical context

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Ms. Chen what is the color and the feature of your umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
My umbrella was dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Page 5 of the investigatory file… the evidence used in the case, is the umbrella yours?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the photo in the original text.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that was my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on that photo was a very common one. It was an umbrella anyone can get at 7-11. How can you proof that it was your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '確定' as 'proof' instead of 'confirm'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, it was brought from 7-11. My umbrella is kind of broken because the button of the umbrella doesn’t work well. I told the police this feature of my umbrella. And when the foreigner put back the umbrella, that umbrella did has this kind of feature.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'My umbrella is kind of broken because the button of the umbrella doesn’t work well.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after 'feature' in the sentence 'And when the foreigner put back the umbrella, that umbrella did has this kind of feature.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of reporting the issue to the police, which was present in the original text.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the other party is willing to apologize and he is regretful, will you forgive him? Since it was only an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it was only an umbrella? It was something about integrity. If he didn’t bring back my umbrella, I have to walk back to my home without an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Oh… okay, I see. I will subpoena his professor and two of his friends to the court. The next proceeding will be at 3pm June 25th. The defendant, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, I will be here.
可以，我可以到庭。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The accuser, Ms. Chen, you can choose to come to the court or not. Basically, we will just ask questions of his friends and professor.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about asking questions of the accuser if she chooses to come to court.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No. I am not going to come. I don’t want to take a leave.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'No' at the beginning of the sentence, which changes the meaning of the statement.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. This is the end of today’s procedure. Please sign the court script before you leave.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the instruction for the interpreter to leave the seat after signing the court script.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把雨傘放在後面的架子的時候有看到她。

當時發生了什麼事呢?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
當時陳小姐就對我大叫，說我偷了她的雨傘，但是我沒有偷阿。我試著道歉，但是她不接受，她也不聽。

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
When does Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那時候我跟我同學一起去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館的展覽。當我們看到了某兩件東西的時候，我的同學就說他有點餓，想吃點東西，所以我們就去外面尋找可以吃晚餐的地方。當我在博物館的時候，外面下著大雨，我當時就想說先跟我同學借把傘好了。因為我的體型比較高壯，那我就想說我的同學Adam身形也是這樣，所以我決定借了他的傘。當時我就拿了架上Adam的傘去買了麵包給我的教授和同學。當我回來的時候，陳小姐看到我就馬上大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '當我們看到了某兩件東西的時候' is incorrect. It should be '當我們看到某兩件東西的時候'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
The defendant, do you mean that you borrowed Adam’s umbrella at that time, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly refers to the defendant as 'the defendant' instead of 'you'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user places the verb 'mean' before the subject 'defendant', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我當時認為我拿了亞當的傘，我並沒有要偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我當時認為我拿了亞當的傘，我並沒有要偷任何人的傘。'

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我記憶當中，那把傘就是藍色的阿。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'color' as '傘' (umbrella) instead of '藍色' (blue color).

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，可以證明我的言詞的就是我的教授和同學，當時我和教授和同學一起出去買東西，然後教授也想借我傘。因為她的傘比較舊，所以我就沒有拿她的傘。當時我的教授和同學也都知道。

我覺得可以啊。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

Ok, now I’m going to ask the plaintiff, Miss Chen.Miss Chen, can you tell me about the process of the incident?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Miss Chen, can you tell me what happened that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum in that day and the weather is rainy, so when I came into the museum, I put the umbrella on the rack… but after I’m going to left the museum, I found that my umbrella is missing.I asked the worker of the museum and they found there is a person put back the umbrella.When I found that the defendant took my umbrella, I was very angry because the weather was rainy, I just thought this person had no kind heart.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What was the color and characteristics of the umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
I remembered that my umbrella is blue…oh…deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'deep blue' instead of 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Investigatory file 1 page 5, is that photo your blue umbrella?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'blue' in the translation.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella is very ordinary and it may be bought in the 711 convenient store on that photo. How can you say that this is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the umbrella is 'very ordinary' instead of '普通的那種' which means 'ordinary type'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, this umbrella was bought in the 711 convenient store and the button of the umbrella has some problems.When I report the incident to the police, I emphasized that feature…… and the foreigner did take the umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged and couldn't be buttoned properly.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the fact that they explained the umbrella's condition to the police.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user didn't mention that the foreigner returned the umbrella to the umbrella stand.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
The plaintiff, if the defendant has the regret and sincerely apologizes to you, could you forgive the foreigner? Because it was not a big deal, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
This umbrella is not ordinary. If I just the foreigner, in other words, it means that at that day I have to undertook the rain, so I don’t want to forgive the person?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of 'just'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'have to return it'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Ok, we will subpoena the three people to come to the court at 3 p.m. on 6/25 and the defendant and other witness should come to the court. Is that date, Ok, the defendant?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the date is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not to come to here at the nest proceeding. In that day, I just want to ask the professor and classmates about the process of the incident.

新北市三峽區學府路132號5樓之4
Floor 25 to 4, Xuefu Rd., Sanxia Dist., New Taipei City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The time was at May 27, 2018. The incident happened at Yingge Ceramics Museum in New Taipei city. You took Hsiao-Chien Chen’s umbrella without her permission. You were caught by her with her spot, and thus she pressed charges. Today’s procedure is mainly to understand what happened that day. Answer my questions so that we can understand the details of the incident. Do you understand? Later I’ll also ask the accuser about what happened that day. Do both understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '造訪' as 'visited' instead of 'took'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase 'The time was at May 27, 2018' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Defendant, where were you at 4:15 pm. At May 27th 2018?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'accused' before 'defendant'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase 'at 4:15 pm' after the question instead of before.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the present tense 'were' instead of the past tense 'were'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'in' before 'May 27th 2018'.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see Ms. Chen?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'you' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'did' instead of 'do' in the translation.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，我把傘放回傘架的時候，就看到她了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我看到她了' instead of '就看到她了'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
And what happened then?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對我大叫，說我偷了她的傘。我試著跟她說我拿錯傘了，並不是要偷，試著跟她道歉但她都不聽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '他對我大叫' is incorrect. It should be '她對我大叫'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我拿錯傘了' is translated as 'I must have taken the wrong one' which does not convey the meaning of 'I took the wrong one'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
And why Ms. Chen said you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'asked'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'said' before the subject 'Ms. Chen', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和幾個同學參觀博物館展覽，看完展覽之後，兩個同學說他餓了，所以就決定出去買東西，或許也找個地方晚餐。當我離開博物館，我發現外面下雨，但沒帶傘，所以想要跟同學借一把。因為我個頭較大，所以我決定去跟我一個朋友亞當借傘。他身形跟我差不多，後來我從傘架拿了傘，和我的教授和幾個朋友去買一些麵包。當我回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我吼叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我和幾個同學參觀博物館展覽' (I and a few classmates visited the museum exhibition). The correct word order should be '我和幾個同學參觀了博物館展覽' (I and a few classmates visited the museum exhibition).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以就決定出去買東西' (So we decided to go out and buy something). The correct word order should be '所以就決定出去買些東西' (So we decided to go out and buy some things).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '或許也找個地方晚餐' (Perhaps also find a place for dinner). The correct word order should be '或許也找個地方吃晚餐' (Perhaps also find a place to have dinner).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以想要跟同學借一把' (So I wanted to borrow an umbrella from my classmates). The correct word order should be '所以想要跟同學借一把傘' (So I wanted to borrow an umbrella from my classmates).
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '他身形跟我差不多' (His body shape is similar to mine). The correct word order should be '他的身形跟我差不多' (His body shape is similar to mine).

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
You mean the umbrella you borrowed was Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你的同學亞當' as 'Adam's' instead of 'your classmate Adam's', changing the meaning.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我以為我拿的傘是亞當的，我並沒有要偷傘的意思。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'steal' was translated as '偷' which means 'to steal' in Chinese, but in this context, it should be translated as '拿' which means 'to take'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you took?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色，是藍色，不是全新的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the object not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is it all blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
我印象中是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the adjective '藍色的' (blue), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '藍色的是' (blue is).

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Is there anyone who can prove what you said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，我走出博物館的時候，教授和其他兩個同學都和我在一起，我的教授甚至借我她的傘。因為她的傘太小了，我沒辦法撐，又不想要她被淋溼。另外兩個同學也在那裏。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我沒辦法撐，又不想要她被淋溼' is incorrect. It should be '我又沒辦法撐，又不想要她被淋溼'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So those three people could help you to prove what you just said, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
What any else evidence do you hope the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著還陳小姐傘但她不要，跟她道歉她也不聽，也許我的教授和朋友可以證明我今天說的都是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著還陳小姐傘但她不要' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試著還陳小姐的傘但她不要'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '跟她道歉她也不聽' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我跟她道歉她也不聽'.
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after the word '也許' in the sentence '也許我的教授和朋友可以證明我今天說的都是真的'. The correct sentence should be '也許，我的教授和朋友可以證明我今天說的都是真的'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK, now I would like to ask Ms. Chen about the details of the incident.Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened that day?'

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge museum. It was rainy. When I entered it, I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I came out, it was gone.I asked the staff to help me find it. Then I saw the foreigner take it back.When I discovered the umbrella he took was mine, I felt angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was rainy outside? How can somebody be so selfish?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'was' instead of 'were' to agree with the plural subject 'umbrella'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '失竊' as 'gone' instead of 'stolen'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '質問' as 'asked' instead of 'questioned'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '公德心' as 'selfish' instead of 'public morality'.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What color was the umbrella you took? Is there anything special on it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella you took?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
What I took was blue. I think it was deep blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '藍色的' as 'blue' instead of 'deep blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Picture on the page 5of exhibit 1, is that umbrella yours?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'exhibit' which is important for context.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella is the ordinary one. That can be bought at 7-11. How could you be sure that umbrella is yours?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker being in possession of the umbrella.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Yes, that was bought at 7-11, but the button on my umbrella is a little bit damaged, a little bit hard to buckle it up.About this point, I have specially explained to the police. The umbrella that the foreigner took back had this feature. Therefore, I am sure that’s mine.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'a little bit hard to buckle it up' should be 'a little bit hard to buckle up'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'The umbrella that the foreigner took back had this feature' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text, which states that the foreigner put the umbrella back on the umbrella stand.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the user explained the damage to the police when reporting the case.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then I ask you, if the other party shows regrets and is willing to apologize, will you forgive him? After all, that is only an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean “only an umbrella?” that is a basic moral problem. Had he not returned the umbrella, I would have to walk home in the pouring rain? I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'only' instead of 'what do you mean'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the question mark at the end of the sentence instead of after '只是一把傘'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題' which means 'this is a basic moral problem'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '如果當天他沒有拿來還' which means 'if he had not returned it that day'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '難道要我淋大雨回家嗎?' which means 'should I have to walk home in the pouring rain?'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
OK, I see. We will subpoena the three witnesses just mentioned to ask them about what happened that day. The next court is set at 3 pm. on June 25th, 2018. The defendant and the three witnesses should be here. The defendant, is that date OK with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'The next court is set for June 19th, 2018, at 3 pm.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the year in the translation.

Yes, I will be here.
好的，我會到庭。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '庭' is translated as 'here' instead of 'court'.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Ms. Chen. The next court you can choose to be here or not. Basically people whom we’ll ask are the classmates and the professor who were with the defendant that day. If you would like to come, welcome.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The next court you can choose to be here or not.' instead of 'The next court you can choose to be here or not.'

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The defendant, the accuser, Miss Chen, she said the incident happened on May 27th, 2018 and the situation is that you took her umbrella and did not inform her (you took her umbrella without notification… of her) so when you returned the umbrella back, she caught you immediately, and so she reported the case to the police and then filed the lawsuit. So, today, the procedure will focus on what you did that day, and the defendant, we need you to tell us what happened on that day and answer our questions, do you understand? And then, after you, we will ask the accuser what happened on that day, do you both parties understand the procedure?

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The defendant, where were you at 04:50… p.m. on May 27th, 2018?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the time expression is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you see the accuser, Miss Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you see Miss Chen, the accuser, at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把雨傘放回架子上，我就看到她了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我就看到她了' instead of '我就看到了她'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened then?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她對著我大吼、大聲喊叫，說我是小偷，偷了她的傘，但我想我一定是拿錯把了。我有試圖道歉，但她不接受。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation uses a cultural expression that does not match the original meaning.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why would Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我和我同學一起去博物館看展，當我們看完所有的展品時，我有兩…我其中兩個同學覺得很餓，所以我們決定找個地方吃晚餐。當我們要離開時，外面下雨了，可是我剛好沒有帶雨傘，所以我想跟我同學借傘。因為我身材比較高大，所以我向我其中一位同學，亞當，借傘，他的身形跟我比較像。於是我就從架子上 借 了一把傘，然後和我的教授跟我同學一起去買食物這樣，當我們回來後，陳小姐就對著我們大吼。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the phrase '我其中两个同学觉得很饿' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我其中两个同学觉得很饿'.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the phrase '然后和我的教授跟我同学一起去买食物' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '然后和我的教授跟我同学一起去买食物'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Are you saying that the umbrella you borrowed was… did it belong to your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '亞當' as 'Adam' instead of 'classmate, Adam'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對阿，我以為那把傘是亞當的傘啊。我真的沒有有意要去偷人家的東西。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'steal' is not an accurate translation for '偷'. It should be 'take' or 'borrow'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember what… the shape and the color of the umbrella… you took?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色是藍色而已，而且不是很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the car not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Was the umbrella all blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我印象中，應該是，沒錯。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Could anyone prove your word?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
我想，有。當我們走出博物館時，我的教授跟我的兩個同學和我一起走的，我的教授甚至借了我她的傘。因為教授的傘比較小把一點，但我也不想讓教授淋濕，所以我就沒有借了。當時另外兩個同學也在場。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	借了 should be translated as 'lent' instead of 'borrowed'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the professor offered to lend the umbrella

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So, can the three people come to the court to verify your word?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
應該可以吧。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence do you need the prosecutor to help you investigate?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我有試著把雨傘還給陳小姐，也有試圖向她道歉，可是她都不肯接受。我想我同行的那三人可以幫我佐證我的話，告知整個事發的經過。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我想我同行的那三人可以幫我佐證我的話" is incorrect. It should be "我想那三個和我同行的人可以幫我證明我說的話".
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb "告知" should be in the form of "告訴" to match the subject "我同行的那三人".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the speaker tried to apologize to Ms. Chen.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Well, I see. Then, now the court is going to ask Miss Chen what happened on that day.Miss Chen, could you tell us what happened on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'is going to ask' should come before the subject 'the court'.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I remember that day I went to the museum. And before I got inside the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. And after I came out, it was gone. I ask for help from the faculty of the museum, and after that, I saw this guy put my umbrella back into the rack. When I found that it was… this guy took the umbrella that I thought was stolen, I questioned him… You didn’t know there was rain outside? Are you crazy? ......
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that it was raining when they went to the museum.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb tense in the question 'You didn’t know there was rain outside?' It should be 'You didn’t know it was raining outside?'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What is… what kind of umbrella did you bring with you that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
It was a blue umbrella I thought. Dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue' instead of 'navy blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Please show Exhibit on page 5, is that your umbrella?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'photo' in their translation, which is an important detail.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it is the one.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture, it is the kind that we can buy from a convenience store. It’s really common. How can you recognize that it is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the 7-11 convenience store in their translation.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
It is true I bought the umbrella at a convenience store. And… there is something different with my umbrella. A button was broken. It can’t match… I told the police about the button things, and so… I found that this guy return the same umbrella with the same button problem, so I knew it was him stole my umbrella.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence 'I found that this guy return the same umbrella with the same button problem, so I knew it was him stole my umbrella.'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Well, if the other party has the sense… if the other party will apologize with regrets, can you forgive him? It was just only an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
An umbrella? What do you mean “an umbrella”? Do you know how the situation is completely out of control of moral? It was a rainy day. Heavy rain. Do you know the situation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Fine, the court will send the subpoenas to the three witnesses to ask them to came to the court to help us know more about the… what happened on that day. And the date of the proceeding is at 03:00 p.m. on June 25th, 2018. The defendant and the three witness must come to the court, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'to ask them to came to the court' is incorrect. It should be 'to ask them to come to the court'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The date 'June 25th, 2018' is translated as '103年6月19日', which is incorrect. It should be '2018年6月25日'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after 'the defendant' in the sentence 'The defendant and the three witness must come to the court'. It should be 'The defendant, and the three witness must come to the court'.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會出席的。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The accuser, Miss Chen, the proceeding, you can either show up or not. Actually, we… the court just needs to know about what happened on that day from the three witnesses.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
That won’t be necessary. I won’t came here. I won’t came to the court. I don’t want to take any day-off…
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in 'I won't came here' and 'I won't came to the court'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in 'I won't came here' and 'I won't came to the court'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of 'any' in 'I don't want to take any day-off'

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
Well, the court understand, and today’s investigation procedure is adjourned, and please both parties sign here, please. (sign the paper, please)
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'please sign the paper'.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you see the plaintiff, Miss. Xiaoqian Chen.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，當我把雨傘放回架上的時候，我有看到她。

當時發生了什麼事呢?
Then what happened?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她大叫著說我偷了她的雨傘，我也嘗試跟她講說我並沒要偷他的傘，我只是拿錯傘了。我試著跟她道歉，但她不聽。

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Then why Miss. Chen said that you stole her umbrella?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'said' before the subject 'Miss. Chen' instead of after.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天，我跟幾個同學一起去博物館參觀一個展覽，到一半的時候，我同學突然說肚子餓了，所以我們決定出去買點東西，也許順便會吃個晚餐。當我們走出博物館的時候，我們發現外面在下雨，我沒有帶傘，所以當時想說要借我其中一個同學的傘。因為我比較高大，所以我想說借跟我差不多身型的艾登的傘，他的傘跟我的很像。然後我就帶著那個傘，還有我的教授跟兩個朋友一起去買東西，當我買了麵包回來的時候，就遇到了陳小姐，她就開始對著我大叫
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'yell at' as '大叫', which means 'shout loudly', but the correct translation should be '責罵' or '責怪', which means 'scold' or 'blame'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Well do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed is your classmate’s, Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '你同學亞當的' as 'your classmate's, Adam's' instead of 'your classmate Adam's'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我當時以為那把傘是我朋友的，我並沒有想要去偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為那把傘是我朋友的'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella you borrowed at…on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.

在我的印象中，它是藍色的。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，當時我離開博物館的時候有我的教授跟兩位同學跟我同行，其中我的教授甚至還說要救我他的傘。但是因為他的傘對我來講太小了，我不想要淋濕，所以就婉拒了，當時我另外兩個同學也在場。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'lend' as 'save'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect placement of '他的傘'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the professor's offer to lend the umbrella

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
So the three people you mentioned they can come to the court and support what you said, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'can' should agree with the plural subject 'three people'.

I guess so.
我想是的

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
What else do you want the investigator…the prosecutor to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我試著要還陳小姐傘。但他不要；我也有試著跟她道歉，但她也不應。也許我的教授跟兩位同學能夠來佐證我今天所說的話都是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也有試著跟她道歉，但她也不應' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我也試著跟她道歉，但她也不應'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'return' in the sentence '我試著要還陳小姐傘'. The correct translation should be '我試著要還陳小姐傘給她'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day. It was rainy. And when I…when I was leaving the museum I…when I went into the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I was leaving the museum, I found my umbrella was lost I asked the staff in the museum for help, and at that time, I saw the foreigner tried to return my umbrella to the rack. When I found that the umbrella he took was the one that I lost, I was very angry. Didn’t she know…didn’t he know that the outside was rainy? How can he do that?

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought my umbrella in 7-11. But the bottom of my umbrella was a little bit broken, so I can…so I am sure that was my umbrella. When I reported to the police, I …I no…I mentioned this point. The umbrella like the foreigners returned to the rack, I found this on that umbrella.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
If the other party was regret and he was…is willing to apologize to you, will you pardon him? After all, it was only an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean that it was just an umbrella? It was the…the problem about his personality. If he didn’t return the umbrella, I will get wet and I couldn’t…I couldn’t go home. I do not want to pardon him.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'say' instead of 'accuse'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那一天我跟班上的一些同學去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館的展覽。在我們看完所有展覽物品之後，我、的兩位同學說他們有點餓了，所以我們那時正想要出去找點食物，甚至就是找個地方吃晚餐。當我們正要離開博物館的時候，我發現外面下雨了，所以……因為我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟班上的同學借一把傘。因為我身…身形比較高大，所以我想說，我會向……艾登借傘。他…的身形跟我比較類似。所以我就從傘架上拿了一把傘。之後，我…就跟我的兩…教授和兩位同學去買了一些麵包。當我回來時，把傘放回傘架，陳小姐就對著我大叫。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	艾登 should be translated as Adam
grammar and structure	word order errors	The sentence structure is not correct in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	The reason for Ms. Chen yelling at the user is missing in the translation

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Did you mean that the umbrella you borrowed at that time was belonged to your classmate, Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the sentence, resulting in a mismatched meaning.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我認為當時我拿的那把傘是亞當的。我完全沒有要偷別人傘的意思
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Then did you remember …the color and the shape of the umbrella you just …took that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得…傘的顏色是…藍色。它不是一個全新的傘。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '傘的顏色是' (the color of the umbrella is) after '我只記得' (I only remember), which resulted in a word order error.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '不是一個全新的傘' (not a brand new one) before '傘的顏色是' (the color of the umbrella is), which resulted in a word order error.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '不是一個全新的傘' (not a brand new one) as 'it is not a new umbrella', which does not convey the same meaning as the original text.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is that umbrella blue from the head to the bottom?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '整隻都是' as 'from the head to the bottom', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的印象中，它是藍色的。

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Could anyone prove the thing you just mentioned?

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有的。當我走出…博物館的時候，我的教授和兩位同學都跟我待在一起。我的教授甚至有問我說…要不要借我她的傘。但因為她的傘太小了，所以我並沒有…跟她拿，我不希望她ㄕ…就是…被雨淋濕。當時，另外兩位同學也跟我們待在一起。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'offered to lend' as 'asked if I wanted to borrow'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the reason for not taking the umbrella

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Then the above-mentioned three people could have come to the court to …prove what you said is the truth, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想是的。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any evidence …that you want … the prosecutor to investigate on your behalf?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
當時我…有試著、向陳小姐解釋我並沒有偷她的傘，但是、她不聽我說；我也有嘗試向她道歉，但她也不聽我…道歉。我想，我的教授和兩位同學可能可以證實我說的話都是實話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我也有嘗試向她道歉，但她也不聽我…道歉。'

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?

grammar and structure	word order errors	rearranged the sentence structure
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	used 'remember' instead of 'bring'
omission or addition	omitting important details	did not include the question about the umbrella's features

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I took with me that day was probably blue, and……I think it’s dark blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '應該是深藍色的' as 'I think it’s dark blue', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '應該' (should/must).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Show evidence 1, page 5. Is the picture on the page……the umbrella…on it belonged to you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is that umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'that' is used instead of 'this', changing the meaning.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on the picture is…… very, very normal. It is the one you can buy in a 7-11. How can you make sure that this is your umbrella?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'very, very normal' instead of 'very ordinary' to describe the umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'in the picture' which is important for understanding the context.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, my umbrella was bought in a 7-11. But my umbrella was a little broken on the part of the button; it cannot wrapped……very well.I have reported this… thing to the police at that time.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Then would you like to forgive him if…ugh this person……has regretted for the whole situation and he also wanted to apologize. Because……in many ways, it’s just an umbrella!
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the person has regretted for the whole situation, while the original text only mentions regret and willingness to apologize.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the sentence 'Because……in many ways, it’s just an umbrella!'

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by “just an umbrella”? What would happen if he didn’t return the umbrella? Then I have to……go back home in heavy rain! I don’t even want to forgive him!
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'just a matter of an umbrella'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. Instead of 'Then I have to……go back home in heavy rain!', it should be 'Then do I have to go back home in heavy rain?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the person's lack of basic morality, which is an important detail in the original text.

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The accused, where were you at 4:15 PM, May 27th, 2018?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you see the accuser, Xiao Qian Chen?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'accuser' is not an accurate translation for '原告' which means 'plaintiff'.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，我要把我的雨傘放回架上的時候，陳小倩在那裏。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小倩在那裏，我要把我的雨傘放回架上的時候。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
他對著我吼說我偷了他的雨傘，我試著告訴他我並沒有要偷他的雨傘，我應該只是不小心拿錯了。我試著向他道歉，但他聽不進去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '他對著我吼說我偷了他的雨傘'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'I must have taken the wrong one' as '我應該只是不小心拿錯了' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why would she accuse you of stealing her umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'accuse' instead of 'say'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟同學去博物館看展覽，我們看完後，我其中兩個同學說他們餓了，我們就決定外出覓食，順便尋找晚餐要在哪裡吃。在我要離開的時候我發現下雨了，因為我沒有帶雨傘，所以我打算借一支我同學的雨傘。因為我比較高大，所以我決定借我同學亞當的傘，因為他跟我體型一致。然後我就從架上拿了一支傘，跟教授和同學去買了一些麵包，當我回來時，陳小姐就開始對我吼叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "在我要離開的時候我發現下雨了" is incorrect. It should be "我要離開的時候，我發現下雨了".
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence "因為我比較高大，所以我決定借我同學亞當的傘". It should be "因為我比較高大，所以我決定借我同學亞當的傘給我".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the protagonist borrowed the umbrella from the rack. The sentence "然後我就從架上拿了一支傘" should be included.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that Ms. Chen started to yell at the protagonist. The sentence "當我回來時，陳小姐就開始對我吼叫" should be included.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
The umbrella that you took belonged to your classmate, Adam. Is that what you’re saying?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the umbrella belonged to the speaker's classmate, Adam, instead of stating that the umbrella belonged to the user's classmate, Adam.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
對，我當時以為我拿了亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the shape or the color that you took at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you remember what color or shape the umbrella you took that day was?'

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只記得顏色。那是一支藍色的傘，並沒有很新。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the umbrella being an umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjective '藍色的' (blue) before the noun '傘' (umbrella), which is the opposite of the correct word order in Chinese.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the whole umbrella blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的印象中，那支傘是藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation adds the word 'umbrella' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can someone verify your statements?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
有的，在我離開博物館的時候，我的教授和兩名同學都跟著我離開，我的教授甚至有提說要不要借我他的傘。但因為他的傘比較小，所以我就沒有借，因為我不想要他也被雨淋濕，當時另外兩位同學也都在旁邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
I assume that those three people can come to the court to verify your statement. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想應該可以。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Do you have any further evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'court' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我當時試著要還陳小姐她的傘，但是他不願意拿。我當時也試著跟他道歉了，但是他也不接受。也許我的教授跟同學到庭後，可以幫助證明我的說詞是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我當時試著要還陳小姐她的傘' is incorrect. It should be '我當時試著要還陳小姐的傘'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence '但是他不願意拿'. It should be '但是她不願意拿' to match the subject '陳小姐'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun '他' is used incorrectly in the sentence '我當時也試著跟他道歉了'. It should be '她' to refer to '陳小姐'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker tried to return Ms. Chen's umbrella. It should be included in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker tried to apologize to Ms. Chen. It should be included in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker's professor and friends will be able to prove the truth of what the speaker said. It should be included in the sentence.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
I see. Now let’s move on to Ms. Chen. I am going to ask you some questions regarding the incident happened on that day. Ms. Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day. It was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack outside. But when I got out of the museum, the umbrella was gone. I asked the staff members in the museum to help me find my umbrella. Afterwards, I saw this foreigner coming back with MY umbrella. When I realized that he was holding my umbrella, I was very angry. So I asked him, “Why did you take my umbrella? Didn’t you know that it was raining outside? How can someone be so impolite?”
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'have' instead of 'has' in the question 'Didn’t you know that it was raining outside?'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user used the word 'impolite' instead of 'lacking in public spirit' to describe the foreigner's behavior.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
What was the color of the umbrella that your brought on that day? Were there any features?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella that you brought on that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The color was blue. It was probably a dark blue umbrella.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the umbrella being dark blue.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Show exhibit number one. Please look at page number five. Is the umbrella on this picture yours?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is the umbrella in this picture yours?'

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that’s the one.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in this picture is a very regular umbrella. It’s the kind of umbrella that you can buy at any 7-11 convenience store. How can you be so sure that it’s your umbrella?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的那種' as 'regular umbrella' instead of 'ordinary kind'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
It’s true that I bought my umbrella in 7-11. However, my umbrella has some damage in the button area. I told the police about this feature when I was filing for this case. And the umbrella that the foreigner put back to the rack has the same features. Therefore, I can be sure that it’s my umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And the umbrella that the foreigner put back to the rack has the same features.' The correct word order should be: 'And the umbrella that the foreigner put back on the rack has the same features.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user explaining the damage to the police when filing the case. The correct translation should include this detail: 'I explained this feature to the police when I was filing the case.'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
So, can you forgive him after he showed regrets? Because, at the end of the day, it’s just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it’s JUST an umbrella? This is a question of basic morals. What if he didn’t bring back the umbrella that I had to go home in the rain? I do not want to forgive him AT ALL!
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'JUST', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '只是' in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'he didn’t bring back' instead of 'he didn’t bring it back', resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '一個人有沒有基本道德的問題' which is an important detail in the original text.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I see. The court will subpoena the three witnesses that the accused mentioned. The next proceeding is set at 3 PM, on June 25th, 2018. The three witnesses and the accused should all be here on that day. The accused, is this date okay with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the date is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The year is missing in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the mention of the accused being required to attend the court hearing.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會到庭。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The accuser, you can choose to be here or not for the next proceeding. Basically, we’ll be asking question to the three witnesses that the accused mentioned. You can be here if you want. Do you understand?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the accuser is Chen Xiaojie.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'Do you understand?' at the end of the sentence instead of at the beginning.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
That won’t be necessary. I do not want to take another day off.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of having to take another day off.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. This is the end of today’s proceeding. Please leave after you sign the court script.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'promise' should be in the present tense to match the present situation. It should be 'I promise to faithfully and honestly translate or interpret.'
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after the word 'stated' in the sentence 'I promise to faithfully and honestly translate or interpret what is stated in this court.' It should be 'I promise to faithfully and honestly translate or interpret what is stated in this court.'

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?

Afterwards, I also will inquire the accuser about the detail of that day’s situation. Do both parties understand?

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'happened' should agree with the singular subject 'the case' instead of 'the time'. It should be 'The case happened on May 27th, 2018.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'giving back the umbrella' should be 'returning the umbrella'.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time, did you see the accuser, Mr. Chen Miss. Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'Miss Chen' instead of 'Mr. Chen Miss. Chen'.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我跟我的同學是到鶯歌博物館鶯歌陶瓷博物館去參加一場展覽，當展覽看完之後，其中一位同學說肚子有點餓了，所以我們就打算去找一些東西吃，或許找一些東西當作晚餐。當我要走出鶯歌陶瓷博物館時，外面下雨了，我沒有帶我的傘，所以我就想說要從我朋友那邊借一支。因為我長得比較強壯一點，所以我就想說要從我的朋友艾登那邊借一支傘，因為他的身形跟我比較相似。所以我就從架上拿出拿走了一把傘，然後跟我的兩位朋友跟教授一起去吃午一起去買晚餐，當我們回來時，我就看到陳小姐在那邊對者我大叫。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	鶯歌博物館 (Yingge Museum) was translated as 鶯歌陶瓷博物館 (Yingge Ceramic Museum)

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you took is your friends Adam’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '同學' as 'friends' instead of 'classmate'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我當時以為我拿的傘就是亞當的。我並沒有意思要拿要偷走任何人的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我以為我拿的傘就是亞當的。'

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Did you remember do you remember that what is the color of the umbrella you took that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

When I was about to leave, my umbrella I cannot I couldn’t find my umbrella. I asked the staff in museum to help me find the umbrella. Then, I saw the foreigner returning back my umbrella.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is that was my umbrella.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought that umbrella in a 7-11, but the button on my umbrella is a little bit broken so that so… When I reported to the police, I have already explained that. The umbrella the foreigner returning back also own the feature of a broken bottom, so I can make sure it is my umbrella.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '有沒有可能' as 'is that any chance', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
Did you see the accuser Miss Chen?

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展，我們看完展後，我們都覺得很餓，就決定出去買些食物。當我要離開博物館時，我發現外面正在下雨，而我並沒有帶傘，於是我就想跟我的一位同學借傘。因為我的個子比較高，身型較大，我就跟我的朋友亞當借傘，他的身形跟我很像。之後我就從傘架拿一支傘，和我的教授以及其他同學去買些麵包。當我們回來時，陳小姐看到我拿她的傘就開始對我大叫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '當我要離開博物館時' is incorrect. It should be '當我要離開博物館的時候'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我當時試著要還陳小姐她的傘，但她不接受。我試著跟她道歉，她也不聽。也許我的教授和朋友們可以佐證我今天講的話都是真的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我當時試著要還陳小姐她的傘'.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
Now I’m going to ask Miss Chen what happened that day. Miss Chen could you please describe what happened that day?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
That day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack. However, when I came out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staffs of the museum to help me find the umbrella. Then, I saw this foreigner took my umbrella. I was angry, so I asked he why did he take my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How could he do that to me?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that it was raining when they entered the museum.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'he' instead of 'he did' in the question 'why did he take my umbrella?'.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I brought that day was blue. Dark blue, maybe.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, that is my umbrella.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella in the picture is just the ordinary one, the one you can buy from 7-11. How can you be so sure that it is yours?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '很普通的那種' as 'just the ordinary one' instead of 'the kind that is very common'. This results in a cultural transformation as the user assumes the umbrella is ordinary based on its appearance, while the original text implies it is common based on where it can be purchased.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
Indeed, I bought it from 7-11. However, the button part was a little broken, and the umbrella can’t be closed. When I reported the case to the police, I mentioned this point. The one that the foreigner took had the same feature, so I was sure that it was mine.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was unable to be closed due to a broken button.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '扣不太起來' as 'the umbrella can't be closed' instead of 'the button can't be fastened'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Would you like to forgive the other party if he is regretful and willing to apologize? After all, it is just an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean it is just an umbrella? This is an issue of morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, I would have got wet when I went home. I don’t want to forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just', which does not convey the intended meaning of '什麼叫做「只是」一把傘?'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
I understand. Then, we will subpoena the three witnesses that were mentioned before. We will ask them to come to the court to explain what happened that day. The next court date will be set at 3 pm June 25th 2018. The defendant, is the time okay for you?

Yes, I will be here.
是的我會到庭。

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
The accuser, Miss Chen, the next court date you can choose to come or not to come. We will ask some questions to the defendant’s classmates and professor.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The accuser, Miss Chen, can choose to come or not to come on the next court date.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the questions will be asked to the defendant's classmates and professor.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, I will have to take another day off.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
I understand. The court is rest. Please sign the scrip before you leave.

No. 4, Floor 25, No. 132, Xuefu Road, New Taipei City

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
The incident happened on May 27th, 2018. And the accused, Paul Anderson is accused of taking away an umbrella of the accuser Chen Xiaoqian. Because the accused didn’t inform the accuser that he took the umbrella, when he returned the umbrella, he was caught. Therefore the accuser decided to file a lawsuit against him. And the location was at Yingge Ceramics Museum. Today’s procedure is to find the reason of this case and let the prosecutor know what happened about the incident. Do you fully understand? Later I will ask the accuser what happened about the incident to fully understand this case. Do both parties understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And the accused, Paul Anderson is accused of taking away an umbrella of the accuser Chen Xiaoqian.' The correct word order should be: 'And the accused, Paul Anderson, is accused of taking away the accuser Chen Xiaoqian's umbrella.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the incident happened in 2018. This detail is crucial for understanding the timeline of events.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the location of the incident, which is the Yingge Ceramics Museum. This detail is important for understanding the context of the case.

I understand.
我了解。

我了解。

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
The accused, where were you at 4:15pm on May 27th, 2018?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
我当时在莺歌陶瓷博物馆。

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
At that time did you see the accuser Miss Chen?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you see Miss Chen, the accuser, at that time?'

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
是的，当我把雨伞还回去的时候，陈小姐在那里。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '当我把雨伞还回去的时候，陈小姐在那里。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?
What happened at that time?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
她当时对着我大叫，说我偷了她的伞，我于是向她解释我可能是拿错了伞，并没有偷。我当时也试图给它道歉，但她并不接受。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我于是向她解释我可能是拿错了伞，并没有偷' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我于是向她解释，我可能是拿错了伞，并没有偷。'

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
那天我和同学去了莺歌陶瓷博物馆去看一个展览，看完展品之后，有同学说很饿想去吃东西，于是我们想去找一个吃东西的地方，和找个地方吃晚饭。当我离开博物馆之后，我看到下雨了，但是我并没有带伞，于是我就想说借同学的伞。因为我身材高大，所以我想借亚当的雨伞，因为他身材和我差不多。我从架子上拿了一把雨伞，然后就给教授和同学买面包，当我回来的时候，就发现陈小姐对我大喊大叫。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'Museum' as '莺歌陶瓷博物馆' which means 'Yingge Ceramic Museum' instead of 'Museum'. 
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '那天' (that day) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the classmates and the user visited the museum for an exhibition.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user went to buy bread with the professor and two other friends.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that Ms. Chen started to yell at the user after they came back.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed is from your classmate Adam?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '亞當' as 'Adam' instead of 'your classmate Adam'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
是的，我当时觉得自己拿的是亚当的雨伞，我并没有被想要偷任何人的雨伞。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella' as '我并没有被想要偷任何人的雨伞', which means 'I didn't want to steal anyone's umbrella'. The meaning of 'didn't intend to steal' is not accurately conveyed.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you borrowed that day?

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
我只记得雨伞的颜色。它是蓝色的，然后并不是崭新的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the mention of the umbrella at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not being a brand new umbrella in their translation.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
Is the umbrella all blue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
在我的印象当中，那个伞是蓝色的。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'umbrella' from the translation.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
Can anyone verify what your said?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
是的，当我离开博物馆的时候，我和一个教授和两个同学一起。教授当时甚至要借给我她自己的伞。因为她的伞太小了，我不想身上淋湿，所以没要她的伞，当时两个同学也在那里。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我和一个教授和两个同学一起' is incorrect. It should be '我和一个教授和两个同学一起' instead.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor and classmates were with them when they came out from the museum.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the professor offered to lend them her umbrella.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the other two classmates were also present.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
Do you mean that all three of them can be present at the court and verify what you said, am I right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I guess so.
我想应该是这样。

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
Is there any evidence you want the police to help investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
我试图把伞归还给陈小姐，但她不要，我也试图给她道歉，但她也不接受，也许我的教授和同学能证实我说的是真的吧。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我也试图给她道歉" is incorrect. It should be "我也试图道歉给她".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
OK, let me ask you a few questions on what happened about the incident?Miss Chen, can you tell us what happened at that time on this incident?

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
It was raining when I was going to the Yingge Ceramics Museum. And I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I was about to leave the museum, the umbrella was gone. I asked the staff from the museum to help me find the umbrella and I found that this foreigner returned the umbrella. I was quite angry the umbrella he returned was exactly the one that I have. I asked him why did he take my umbrella. How could he be so ethically irresponsible?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the umbrella was stolen.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'have' instead of 'had' in the last sentence.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
Miss Chen, what’s the color of your umbrella? Are there any characteristics of your umbrella?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be changed to 'was' to match the past tense of the original text.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
The umbrella I took that day was blue, dark blue I guess.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'dark blue I guess', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '應該是深藍色的' (should be dark blue).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
Exhibit evidence one, page five. Does the umbrella on the photo belongs to you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'please' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the singular form 'belongs' instead of the correct plural form 'belong'.

對，就是這把傘。
Yes, it belongs to me.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
The umbrella on the photo was quite ordinary that can even be bought everywhere like 711. How can you be so sure that the umbrella on the photo is yours?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '7-11' as '711', which is not the correct translation. '7-11' is a specific convenience store chain and should not be translated as a number.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
It is indeed bought at a 711-convenience store. But my umbrella has some problems with its buttons and it can’t be fixed. I explained to the police about this matter and the umbrella the foreigner returned on the rack also has problems with its buttons. So I think it’s exactly the same umbrella.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the fact that the umbrella was damaged at the button area.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the phrase '扣不太起來' as 'it can't be fixed' instead of 'the button can't be fastened'. The meaning of the original text is lost in translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the fact that the user explained the issue with the umbrella to the police.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation skips the mention of the specific characteristic of the umbrella that the foreigner returned on the rack also had button problems.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses the word 'rack' instead of '傘架' which means 'umbrella stand'.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
Would you forgive him after he apologizes to you and show his regrets? After all it’s only an umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
What do you mean by just an umbrella. It’s a matter about moral qualities. If he did not return my umbrella, I would go in the rain and go home. I would not forgive him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just an' instead of 'what do you mean by'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'It' after the verb 'mean' instead of before
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'if he did not return my umbrella' in the second sentence

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
Ok, I understand. This court will subpoena three witnesses to the court. And the next proceeding will be at 3pm, June 25th, 2018. And the three witnesses shall be at the court for the proceeding. Are you ok with this date?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the date is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The original text specifies the year as 103, but the translation omits this detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not mention that the three witnesses are also required to attend the court proceeding.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not mention that the defendant is also required to attend the court proceeding.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'shall' should be 'should' to match the subject 'the three witnesses'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The translation uses the past tense 'were' instead of the future tense 'will be' to indicate the next court proceeding.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the specific time of the court proceeding, which is 3pm.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the specific date of the court proceeding, which is June 19th.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the year of the court proceeding, which is 103.

Yes, I will be here.
是的，我會到庭。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
Miss Chen, for the next proceeding, you can either come or not because the next proceeding is mainly to ask questions to the professors and students. It’s okay for you to come to the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the plaintiff is Miss Chen.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'to the court' in the wrong position in the sentence.

不用了，這樣我還要請假。
No, I will not be present at the next proceeding because I have to ask for a leave permit.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they will not be present at the next proceeding.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'have' instead of 'will'.

我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
Ok, I understand. This court is dismissed. Please sign the court script and then leave.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Please sign the court script and then leave.'

Abus Gashion先生，你102年09月15日在桃園中正國際機場停車場，拿了機車車牌KB405上的一頂男用帽子，之後經受害者報案、警方調閱停車場的監視器紀錄，經身分確認後，了解該行為是你所為。由於該行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，又經受害者提出告訴，你涉嫌犯竊盜罪。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎?
Abus Gashion, in year 102, September 15th, did you take a helmet from a motorcycle numbered KB405 in the International Taoyuan Airport in the parking lot? The owner of the helmet told us. We had a look at the videotape from the airport and found out the thief is you. Because you did that without telling the owner, you are… What we do today is to understand what happened on that day. Please answer what I just asked so that we can understand the process of the whole case. Do you understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of '拿了' as 'take' instead of 'stole'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form 'is' instead of 'was'
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing mention of the victim reporting the incident

I understand.
我了解了

那請問102年9月15日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Where were you in the year 102 on September 15th?

I was at CKS International Airport.
我當時在桃園國際機場
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the name of the airport, CKS International Airport.

你當時去機場做什麼呢??
What did you do in the airport?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
我去接一個來拜訪台灣的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我去接來拜訪台灣的一個朋友'.

所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
So did you pick up your friend at the terminal?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '航廈' as 'terminal' instead of 'airport'.

Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.
對，我搭公車去機場的，但我早到了，所以就在那邊等我朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那為什麼後來會發生你拿原告帽子這件事呢?
What happened to the case that you just stole someone’s helmet?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text.

I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.
噢，我在等我朋友，但是有點無聊，所以我就到處晃晃，消磨時間。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我在等我朋友，但是有點無聊，所以我就到處晃晃，消磨時間。'

你後來去了哪裡呢?
So where did you go at the end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I went to the parking lot for motorcycles.
我去停車場找機車。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我去機車停車場。'

然後發生了什麼事呢?
And what happened after that?

I saw a cap left on one motorcycle.
我看到一隻貓在一台機車上 (顆顆…沒聽清楚…)
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of translating 'cap' as '帽子' (hat), the user translated it as '貓' (cat).

(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?
Can you have a look? Is this helmet in the picture?

Yes, it is that cap.
對，就是那一頂。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'cap' is translated as '頂' which means 'top' or 'crown' instead of '帽子' which means 'hat'.

然後呢? 發生了什麼事?
And what happened?

Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
因為四下無人，所以我就把帽子拿走了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為無人四下，所以我就把帽子拿走了。'

你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?
Did you just said that you just took the cap?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I did.
痾，對。

你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?
Don’t you know that the cap belongs to others? You cannot just take it.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '隨便拿走' as 'just take it' instead of 'cannot just take it', changing the meaning.

I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
我真的很抱歉我的所作所為，我嘗試把帽子還擁有者但是…
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '還' should come before the object '帽子'.

所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎?
I just confirm it to you one more time.You were at the International Taoyuan Airport and because you saw no one there so you took the hat that didn’t belong to you.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the motorcycle parking lot in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the past tense 'were' instead of the present tense 'are' to describe the location of the incident.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '拿了' as 'took' instead of 'picked up'.

Yes, that’s what happened.
沒錯這就是事情的經過。

因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?
And now because the owner has accused you of that, would you like to have a talk with the owner?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me.
我嘗試要跟他道歉，但他不跟我講話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我嘗試跟他道歉' instead of '我嘗試要跟他道歉'.

沒關係，如果你有意願，我們會幫你跟原告進行和解，那先訂103年2月27日早上9點鐘進行調解，你可以到庭嗎? 如果一切順利，可能就會以金錢賠償的方式，結束這個案子，你明白嗎?
It’s okay. If you have the will, we will help you with the case. We’ll have you talk to the owner.So that’s have a deal. At 9am, February 27th, in the year 103, we will meet you here and have a talk with the owner. Is that okay for you?If all of these are okay for you, we are going to end this case with paying money. Do you understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning: 'have a deal' instead of 'have a settlement'
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversed word order: 'have you talk to the owner' instead of 'have the owner talk to you'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omitted mention of 'mediation' or 'settlement'

Abus Gashion先生，你102年09月15日在桃園中正國際機場停車場，拿了機車車牌KB405上的一頂男用帽子，之後經受害者報案、警方調閱停車場的監視器紀錄，經身分確認後，了解該行為是你所為。由於該行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，又經受害者提出告訴，你涉嫌犯竊盜罪。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎?

At 2013 september fifteen at four and….where are you at that time?

I was at CKS International Airport.
我那時後在cks 國際機場
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'cks' instead of 'CKS' in the translation.

I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
我去那邊接一個要來遊歷的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我去那邊接一個來台灣遊歷的朋友'.

所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
So you mean that you took..took up your friend at airport
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.
是的我是搭公車去機場那邊，後來我朋友來遲了我就在那邊等他
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我是搭公車去機場那邊' instead of '是的我是搭公車去機場那邊'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about arriving early at the airport.

那為什麼後來會發生你拿原告帽子這件事呢?
Then how could it happen that you steal victim helmet
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '原告' as 'victim' instead of 'plaintiff'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'steal' before the noun 'helmet', resulting in incorrect word order.

I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.
我在那邊等我朋友結果他來遲了我只好找些事情殺殺時間
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我在那邊等我朋友，結果他來遲了，我只好找些事情殺殺時間。'

你後來去了哪裡呢?
So where are you going next?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I went to the parking lot for motorcycles.

我看到一隻貓？在摩托車上…
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '貓' (cat) was used instead of '帽子' (cap).

(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '帽子' as 'helmet' instead of 'hat'.

Yes, it is that cap.
沒錯就是那帽子
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

然後呢? 發生了什麼事?
And then what happened next?

Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
因為那附近沒有人…我就拿了那個帽子
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我就拿了那個帽子' instead of '因為那附近沒有人…我就拿了那個帽子'.

你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?
You mean that you just took other's cap?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I did.
喔我就是阿
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '阿' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?
Don't you know that this cap belongs to other's, you cannot took it away.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'you cannot take it away' instead of 'you cannot took it away'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'took' is a past tense verb, which does not match the present tense of the original text. It should be 'take' instead.

I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
我很抱欠我知道這樣是不對的，所以我拿帽子來還人阿
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the object.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the cap was brought to the current location.

所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎?
Now i affirm…reaffirm you.so you at the parking lot in the airport,and you since you find nobody near by so you took the cap,right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, that’s what happened.

因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?

I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me.
我嘗試跟當事人道歉但是他不願意跟我說
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒關係，如果你有意願，我們會幫你跟原告進行和解，那先訂103年2月27日早上9點鐘進行調解，你可以到庭嗎? 如果一切順利，可能就會以金錢賠償的方式，結束這個案子，你明白嗎?

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user being at the airport. The correct translation should include 'at the airport' to provide the necessary context.

你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?

semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s what happened.
是的

因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '原告' as 'victim' instead of 'plaintiff'.

是的

Abus Gashion先生，你102年09月15日在桃園中正國際機場停車場，拿了機車車牌KB405上的一頂男用帽子，之後經受害者報案、警方調閱停車場的監視器紀錄，經身分確認後，了解該行為是你所為。由於該行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，又經受害者提出告訴，你涉嫌犯竊盜罪。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎?
Mr. Bushion. Did you take away the male helmet at the internation taoyuan airport on September 15 in the year of 2013? Then the victim called the policeThe police identified you by looking at the camera record.Because you didn’t inform the victim of your taking away his helmet, you are accused of theft.The process today is to understand what was happening on that dayPlease answer my questions in order to let us understand this issue better.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Abus Gashion -> Mr. Bushion
grammar and structure	word order errors	Did you take away the male helmet -> Did you take the male helmet away
omission or addition	omitting important details	September 15 in the year of 2013 -> September 15, 2013

I understand.
是的我明白

那請問102年9月15日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Where were you on September 15 in the year of 2013?

I was at CKS International Airport.
那時候我在中正機場
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of being 'at' the airport.

你當時去機場做什麼呢??
What did you do there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
我去那邊接拜訪台灣的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我去那邊接來台灣拜訪的朋友。'

所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
So you were saying that you picked a friend of you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.
是啊！我搭公車到機場，我早到了，所以我在那等我朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我搭公車到機場' instead of '我搭到公車機場'.

那為什麼後來會發生你拿原告帽子這件事呢?
Then why does the thing happen that you took away the victim’s helmet?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.
我在等我朋友啊，他的班機延誤了，所以我很無聊，我只好找些事情來做
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they went around to kill time.

你後來去了哪裡呢?
Then where did you go?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Where did you go then?'

I went to the parking lot for motorcycles.
我去機車停車場
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'parking lot for motorcycles' as '機車停車場' which means 'parking lot for scooters' instead of '機車停車場' which means 'parking lot for motorcycles'.

然後發生了什麼事呢?
Then what happened?

I saw a cap left on one motorcycle.
我看到一個棒球帽掉落在一輛機車上
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '棒球帽' (baseball cap) is not an accurate translation for 'cap' in this context.

(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?
Please take a look at the picture. Is this cap you saw?

Yes, it is that cap.
式的就是那頂棒球帽
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

然後呢? 發生了什麼事?
Then what happened?

Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
因為四下無人，所以我就帶走了棒球帽
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我就帶走了棒球帽' instead of '所以我就帶走了棒球帽'.

你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?
Are you saying that you took away others’ cap?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I did.
null

你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?
Don’t you know that the cap belongs to others? You can’t take others’ stuff.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text expresses surprise and disbelief, while the user's translation simply states a fact.

I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
我對我的所作所為很抱歉，我想要還給她原本的主人我今天也把它帶來了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我今天也把它帶來了。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '想要' is not the appropriate translation for 'tried to'. It should be '試圖' or '嘗試'.

所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎?
Then let me confirm you with the details.On the day, you were at the airport. Then you saw the cap. Because there’s no one around, so you just take away the cap, right?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect, resulting in a confusing sentence structure.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the motorcycle parking lot, which is an important detail in the original text.

Yes, that’s what happened.
這就是事發經過

因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?
Then the prosecutor is accusing you of stealing his stuff. Then do you have the will to apologize?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. The original text asks if the user is willing to apologize and reconcile, while the user's translation states that the prosecutor is accusing the user of stealing.

I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me.
我是過向他道歉，但是她都不理我
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'owner of the cap' is singular, so the verb 'wouldn't' should be 'wouldn't' instead of 'wouldn't'.

沒關係，如果你有意願，我們會幫你跟原告進行和解，那先訂103年2月27日早上9點鐘進行調解，你可以到庭嗎? 如果一切順利，可能就會以金錢賠償的方式，結束這個案子，你明白嗎?
Never mind, if you have the will, then we will help you reconcile with the prosecutors.So how about we make the reconciliation on the day of February 27th. Are you available at the time?If things goes well, then we can end this case with payment.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'So how about we make the reconciliation on the day of February 27th' is incorrect. It should be 'So how about we make the reconciliation on February 27th?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'we can end this case with payment' does not accurately convey the meaning of '以金錢賠償的方式' which means 'in a way of compensating with money'.

I understand and I will be here.
我了解，我會準時到的

好，那我們會通知原告，如果日期不能配合，我們會再通知你，可以嗎? 如果沒有問題，就請你那天準時到本棟四樓的調解室，明白嗎?
Then we will let the prosecutor know about this stuff. If the time isn’t stuitable for him, we’ll let you know.Is this okay with you?If you don’t have problems with this, then please come to the 4th floor. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Then we will let the prosecutor know about this stuff.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'If the time isn’t stuitable for him, we’ll let you know.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after the phrase 'If the time isn’t stuitable for him'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'to the mediation room on the 4th floor' in the sentence 'then please come to the 4th floor.'

I saw a cap left on one motorcycle.
我看到一輛機車上有一頂安全帽…鴨舌帽。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'cap' as '安全帽' (safety helmet) instead of '鴨舌帽' (cap).

(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?
Now, please look at the picture in this file, is the cap in this picture the one you took?

Yes, it is that cap.
沒錯就是那頂帽子。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'cap' is translated as '帽子' which is correct, but the word '頂' is unnecessary and not present in the original text.

然後呢? 發生了什麼事?
Then what happened?

Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
因為沒人在場，所以我拿走了帽子。

你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?

沒錯我拿了。

你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我很抱歉拿了他的帽子'.

所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎?
All right, that’s clear all things again. That day, you were at the parking lot, because no one was there and you saw that hat, so you took it, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'That day, you were at the parking lot, and because no one was there, you saw that hat and took it, right?'

Yes, that’s what happened.
沒錯，這是事情的經過。

因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?
Now because you are accused by the owner, do you want to make a deal with the owner?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me.
我試著向帽子的主人道歉，但是他不願意和我說半句話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是他不願意和我說半句話' instead of '但是他不願意和我說半句話。'

沒關係，如果你有意願，我們會幫你跟原告進行和解，那先訂103年2月27日早上9點鐘進行調解，你可以到庭嗎? 如果一切順利，可能就會以金錢賠償的方式，結束這個案子，你明白嗎?
That’s all right, if you have the will to apologize to the owner, we will help you. So, let’s appoint a meeting at 9:00 in …the February twenty seventh 103 year 9:00, is that ok with you? If everything go through successfully, then you just need to paid for the owner to solve this case.

Abus Gashion先生，你102年09月15日在桃園中正國際機場停車場，拿了機車車牌KB405上的一頂男用帽子，之後經受害者報案、警方調閱停車場的監視器紀錄，經身分確認後，了解該行為是你所為。由於該行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，又經受害者提出告訴，你涉嫌犯竊盜罪。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎?
So, the accuse.....On September 15, do you have the male helmet in the 桃園international airport’s parking lot for KB405.

What did you do in that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
我去那裡接我的朋友,他是來觀光的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我去那裡接來台灣觀光的朋友'.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The translation is too informal. It should be '我去那裡接來台灣觀光的朋友。'

所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
So you mean, you go to the platform?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.

I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.

I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
我真的很抱歉我拿了這頂帽子,我已經想要環他了,我今天也帶來啦
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我已經想要還他了' instead of '我已經想要環他了'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '環' is incorrect in this context. The correct word should be '還', which means 'return'.

所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎?
So, ok.. I will make sure. At that day, in the international airport parking lot, you took the cap because there are no others.

I understand.
我了解。

那請問102年9月15日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
Please tell me where you were in September 15th at 4:15.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the specific year (102年) from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase (下午4點15分時) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.

I was at CKS International Airport.
我在中正機場。

你當時去機場做什麼呢??
What did you do in the airport?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
我去中正機場接機，去接一個來台灣玩的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我去接一個來台灣玩的朋友' instead of '我去中正機場接機'.

所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
So, did you pick up your friend at airport?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pick up your friend at the airport?'

Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.
我是搭公車到機場的，而且我提早到在那邊等朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我搭公車到機場'.

那為什麼後來會發生你拿原告帽子這件事呢?
But, why happened, why did you steal the cap?

I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.
我提早到了，但是因為朋友的班機延誤，所以隨意晃走來殺時間。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我提早到了' instead of '我到了提早'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '隨意晃走' in the translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'went around to kill time'. It should be translated as '四處走動' or '到處逛逛' to convey the idea of wandering around.

你後來去了哪裡呢?
So where did you go later?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I went to the parking lot for motorcycles.
我去了機車的停車場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我去了停車場的機車。'

然後發生了什麼事呢?
What happened later?

I saw a cap left on one motorcycle.
我看到一頂帽子留在摩拖車上。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '一頂帽子留在摩托車上' instead of '一頂帽子留在摩拖車上'.

(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?
Now please see the picture on the page 5. Is the cap is the same as the one you saw that day?

Yes, it is that cap.
對，就是那頂帽子。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'cap' is translated as '帽子' which is the correct translation, but the word '頂' is unnecessary and can be omitted.

然後呢? 發生了什麼事?
What happened later?

Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
因為那天沒人在旁邊，我就拿了那頂帽子。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'because' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '那天' (that day) before the verb '沒人在旁邊' (no one around), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '沒人在旁邊' (no one around) before '那天' (that day).

你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?
Did you just say that you took the cap?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I did.
對啊，我拿啦。

你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?
Didn’t you know that the cap is other’s?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
我對此事深感抱歉，我也想嘗試想把帽子還給原主，我今天就有帶那頂帽子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我今天就有帶那頂帽子。'

所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎?
Now I wanna make sure with you. So, you stole the cap when there was no one in the parking lot for motorcycles, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '拿了' as 'stole' instead of 'took'.

Yes, that’s what happened.
對，那就是那天的發生經過。

因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?
Now, the victim has accused you. Did you want to make a agreement with him?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me.
我有嘗試要跟他道歉，但他都不理我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有嘗試要跟他道歉，但他不理我。'

沒關係，如果你有意願，我們會幫你跟原告進行和解，那先訂103年2月27日早上9點鐘進行調解，你可以到庭嗎? 如果一切順利，可能就會以金錢賠償的方式，結束這個案子，你明白嗎?
That’s okay. If you have the willing to apologize, we will help you. So, we have arranged the date in February…….If everything is okay about the case, we will use money to solve the problem

Okay, later we will tell the victim. If everything is okay, we will tell you. Is that okay?If you don’t have any problems, at that day, we will deal with this problem on the fourth floor in this building. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'later we will tell the victim' should be 'later we will notify the plaintiff'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'If everything is okay, we will tell you' should be 'If everything is okay, we will notify you'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'at that day, we will deal with this problem on the fourth floor in this building' should be 'on that day, we will handle this matter in the mediation room on the fourth floor of this building'.

Abus Gashion先生，你102年09月15日在桃園中正國際機場停車場，拿了機車車牌KB405上的一頂男用帽子，之後經受害者報案、警方調閱停車場的監視器紀錄，經身分確認後，了解該行為是你所為。由於該行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，又經受害者提出告訴，你涉嫌犯竊盜罪。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎?
Mr. Abus Gashion, in 2013 September 15th, you were said to be stealing a helmet from a scooter with the number of KC1F5. So the one who lost his helmet called the police. The video tape was being scanned by the police officers, and they confirm that it’s stolen by you. By accepting the fact that the victim was no informed, the stealing case is confirmed. Today’s standard procedure is to have an idea of what happened that day. Please respond to my questions so the investigator can have a better understanding.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today we are here for the child rearing case between Ferry Johnson and Tasi-yun Shi. Can I ask both sides: do you hire lawyers?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the preparation procedure for the child rearing case.

我有委託律師。
Yes, I have a lawyer.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有律師。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today I want to know the two sides’positions with the child rearing case and I would know why each of you think you are the better side to keep this child. Please state the details especially at this point. Besides, I know this case also has divorce ongoing. So I hope the case of verbal attack does not happen.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Today I want to know the two sides’positions with the child rearing case' is incorrect. It should be 'Today I want to know the positions of the two sides with regard to the child rearing case'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'think' should agree with the subject 'each of you', so it should be 'thinks' instead of 'think'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the divorce case, which is an important detail in the original text.

I understand.
我了解了

了解。
Yes, I understand.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
I have few questions for the plaintiff. Why do you want to get the child rearing right for the kid? As I know, in Taiwan, you don’t have a full-time job and you are a foreigner. Why do you think you are more capable in the case of child rearing?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think you are more capable in the case of child rearing?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權' as 'get the child rearing right for the kid' is not accurate. It should be translated as 'seeking custody of the child'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the plaintiff not having a full-time job and being a foreigner, which is important context for the question.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望法院能判給我全部的撫養權，我有兩個原因。第一，我的妻子沒有再與我們同住了，我想要看著我的女兒長大。再者，我聽說我的太太與其他男人同居，如果這是真，我很疑惑他是否能給我們的女兒完整的照顧，因此我希望獲得撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我希望法院能判給我全部的撫養權' should be '我希望法院能判給我全部的撫養權'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
so do you mean because your wife is now going to divorce with you and at the same time she’living with another man and you also suspected her of living with another man. Is it because of this situation so you don’t want to leave your daughter to her, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，這些是我主要的顧慮。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
In addition, according to your financial status, if you get the sole custody, what would you do to take care of this child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'if you get the sole custody, how would you take care of this child?'

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在的確是們有全職的工作，但是我有兼職許多工作所以我有固定的收入，我想這些收入應該足以支撐我和女兒的生活。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '們' is added, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '有' should agree with the subject '我', but it is conjugated as '們有'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the original text mentions not having a full-time job.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned now you have several part time jobs. Because these are all part time jobs, can you estimate around how much income you will get every month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我有至少4-5件兼職工作，所以平均一個月我可以賺一萬五千元，有時候如果有接到新的計畫，可能有機會賺更多。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我可以平均一個月賺一萬五千元。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'bring me' as '可以賺' is incorrect. A more accurate translation would be '給我帶來'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about having 'on average' four to five part-time jobs.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I have another question, is it possible that when you get the sole custody of your child, you are going to bring your child back to Canada. I will as this question is because even you get the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you take your daughter back to Canada, this will be seen as you cut the tie of your daughter with the mother. To this argument, what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I will as this question is because even you get the sole custody'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text. The original text does not mention 'plea', but the user's translation includes 'what’s your plea?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the possibility of not returning to the original country.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the potential impact on the mother-daughter relationship.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了，我有居留證而且我也喜歡這裡，目前我對在台灣的生活很滿意，特別是我希望我的女兒可以看到他的父母。我要說的是目前我和我太太正在打離婚官司，我們並不希望彼此切斷與女兒的聯繫。在我們離婚官司進行中，我定期會繼我們女兒的照面給太太看，我甚至還安排時間讓我們三個有時兼聚一聚。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我要說的是目前我和我太太正在打離婚官司' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我要說的是我和我太太目前正在打離婚官司'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
so do you mean that in the recent future, you have no plan to go back to Canada, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '返回母國' as 'go back to Canada' instead of 'go back to your home country'.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不，我有可能會回加拿大因為我的母親年紀大了又生病，但即使我回去也不會長久待在那，我甚至不會考慮把女兒帶在身邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我甚至不會考慮把女兒帶在身邊' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我甚至不會考慮把女兒帶在身邊'. The verb '帶' should come before the object '女兒'.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I’m going to ask free questions to the defendant. Currently you are not living your husband any more?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, you have been separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case of divorcing?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
I guess I filed it two months ago.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'filed' should be in the past tense to match the time frame mentioned in the original text.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So you mean far before you filed the case, you hadn’t lived together already.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
What is your living circumstances right now? I mean, who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son in the first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Oh, you mean your first marriage? So what is your marriage with Ferry Johnson right now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He’s my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'husband' in a more formal sense.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
In the child rearing right that you are fighting for right now is with your second husband and it’s a daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'the child rearing right that you are fighting for right now'. The correct translation is 'child custody battle'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order. The correct translation is 'Is it your daughter with your second husband?'

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, was your daughter with you or him?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out my daughter was only two months old so she stayed with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needed the mother's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
where is the child right now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Where is the child right now?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
my daughter is at my husband’s place.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The correct word order should be 'My daughter is at my husband's place.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
do you have any agreement between you two? Why did the daughter stay with you in the first place and then move to your husband’s place?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '中間有什麼協議' as 'do you have any agreement between you two?' instead of 'what agreement do you have?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '原來女兒跟你，現在跟他' as 'Why did the daughter stay with you in the first place and then move to your husband’s place?' instead of 'Why did the daughter originally stay with you and now stay with him?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place I just moved out is smaller and my husband’s bigger. In terms of the environment, my husband’s place is better so I leave the daughter to him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'my husband’s bigger' is incorrect. It should be 'my husband’s place is bigger.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I leave the daughter to him' does not accurately convey the meaning of '我把孩子交給先生'. It should be 'I entrusted the child to my husband.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances don’t change, I mean your living situations, your daughter still better stays at your husband’s place? Why do you want to win the child rearing right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
It took me ten months to get the child. I couldn’t stand that I cannot see her any more. And my husband is a Canadian and he doesn’t have a full-time job. He may go back to Canada any time. Thus, it means I cannot see my daughter any more. That’s why I’m asking the custody of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'It took me ten months to get the child.' It should be 'I carried the child for ten months.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'It took me ten months to get the child' does not accurately convey the meaning of '她是我懷胎十個月生下來的'. The correct translation would be 'She was born after I carried her for ten months.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the speaker is the child's mother.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the speaker's husband is a Canadian citizen.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the husband's job in Taiwan is not stable.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the husband may return to Canada.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the speaker is seeking custody of the daughter.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
In terms of your financial status, can you elaborate how would you raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We still have the divorcing case going. I hope after the case of divorce I can live where my husband’s living now, the house. Thus in terms of environment, the house is better for my daughter. As to my financial status, I’ve offered the court a list of my asset. Besides, I have a regular job. I earn at least 40000 a month. I think I have the right to rear my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Thus in terms of environment, the house is better for my daughter.' The correct word order should be 'Thus, the house is better for my daughter in terms of environment.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I think I have the right to rear my daughter.' The correct verb form should be 'I think I have the right to raise my daughter.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'We still have the divorcing case going.' The correct tense should be 'We are still going through the divorce case.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence 'I hope after the case of divorce I can live where my husband’s living now, the house.' The correct sentence should include the reason for wanting to live in the house, such as 'I hope after the case of divorce I can live where my husband’s living now, in the house, because it provides a stable and familiar environment for my daughter.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence 'As to my financial status, I’ve offered the court a list of my asset.' The correct sentence should include the information about the financial status, such as 'As for my financial status, I have provided the court with a list of my assets to demonstrate my financial stability.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence 'Besides, I have a regular job. I earn at least 40000 a month.' The correct sentence should include the type of job and the stability of the income, such as 'Besides, I have a stable job with a monthly income of at least 40000.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So what’s the process going of your divorcing case? Do you know around what time the case will be settled?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the current status of the divorce case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the question about when the judgment will be made.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not quite sure. This Friday we will go to the court again. I will talk to the judge of the case that we hope to see the result faster.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I hope to express to the judge of the divorce case that I want the judgment to come out as soon as possible.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the divorce case in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Let’s say we will arrange social workers to visit both the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s houses and we will take into account the interactions of both sides with the child. The court will consider the report after the visit and make the best decision for the daughter. However, before that, will both sides consider the shared custody? The sahred custody means that the daughter will stay sometimes at the mother’s place and sometimes at father’s place.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The sahred custody means that the daughter will stay sometimes at the mother’s place and sometimes at father’s place.' is incorrect. It should be 'The shared custody means that the daughter will stay sometimes at the father’s place and sometimes at the mother’s place.'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
對我個人而言我是不希望共同撫養權，因為我的女兒還太小，他才八個月大，我不希望她在我與太太之間流轉。對於這樣年紀小的孩子來說，我覺得這樣太累，一下子搬到母親的地方、一下子換到我的地方。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '對我個人而言我是不希望共同撫養權' should be '對我個人而言，我不希望共同撫養權'.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
At this point, I agree with my husband. The daughter is too little. She shouldn’t and it’s not suitable in this case.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'shouldn’t' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'shouldn’t be'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the arrangement for co-parenting.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So we all arrange the visit of social workers first. After we see the report, we will arrange the next court day to keep the right for both parties to state their rights.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After we see the report, we will arrange the visit of social workers first.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of arranging the visit of social workers first before seeing the report.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation also omits the mention of keeping the right for both parties to state their opinions during the court day.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我同意社工人員的探訪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我同意社工人員的探訪。'

沒有問題，謝謝。
I don’t have any question here. Thank you.

Today I am here… Today this preparing procedure is for court to understand……and I also want to know why you….both of you think that you have the ability to raise the child. Please elaborate this point.Beside,I….beside I also know you have another case for divorce. So I hope there is no verbal attack in this court . Do you understand?

yes,i do

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, let me ask some questions.So plaintiff , why do you want to get the custody right?as i know, you don’t have a job in taiwan. and you are also a foreigner. So for the child rearing case, why do you think you have ability to raise your child?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'let me ask some questions' from the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'do you want' instead of 'why do you want' in the question.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭取' as 'get' instead of 'fight for' in the question.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '撫養權' as 'custody right' instead of 'custody' in the question.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'as i know' from the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'you don’t have a job in taiwan' from the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'and you are also a foreigner' from the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'do you think' instead of 'why do you think' in the question.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '適任' as 'ability' instead of 'suitable' in the question.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '子女撫養權' as 'child rearing case' instead of 'child custody' in the question.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望可以把所有撫養權都判給我，因為我很關心他。第一我老婆已經不再跟我們一起住了，我想要看著我的女兒長大，而且我還聽說我的老婆跟別的男人同居，如果真的是這樣的話我懷疑我老婆沒有能力養活這孩子，所以我要爭取全部的撫養權。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

grammar and structure	pronoun errors	incorrect pronoun usage

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
what you mean is because your wife have divorce case with you, so she is not live with you,right? and you doubt that she lives with other man. it is because of this situation, you don’t want to give your children to her.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，這就是我所關心的。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Other than that, for your financial statement,how do you raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在的確沒有全職的工作。但是我有幾份打工，應該可以提供我所有需要。我想這些收入足以養我和我的女兒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在的確沒有全職的工作。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '應該可以提供我所有需要' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.'

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. since all of them are part-time job, can you estimate your regular income per month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Can you estimate your regular income per month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我個人大概有四到五個兼職工作。全部加起來的話，一個月大概可以提供五萬塊的收入。有時候如果我有接到新案子的話，每個月的收入都會更加增加。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'part-time jobs' in the translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bring me' as '提供' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'bring' in this context.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '的話' which is not present in the original text and is unnecessary.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
So other than salary, will you bring your daughter to Canada after you got the custody, and you will never come back? I mention this point is that even if you got the sole custody, your wife still have visitation right. If you take your daughter back to Canada, it means that you cut the tie with your daughter and her mother. So what do you think?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了。我已經有居留證，而且我很喜歡這個地方。目前還沒有任何打算離開台灣的計畫。而且我也覺得我的女兒也希望可以見到父母。我想說的是即使我現在在和我老婆打離婚官司，我也沒有打算切斷她和女兒之間的聯繫。在我們打離婚官司的同時，我也常常寄我們女兒的照片給她。我甚至和她達成協議，有時候可以大家一起出來聚聚。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我已經有居留證' should be '我已經有居留證了'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean that you are not going back to Canada recently, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '返回母國' as 'going back to Canada', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
沒有...如果我要回加拿大的話是因為我媽媽又老又生病了。然而，就算我回去加拿大了，我也不會在那裡久留。我也不會考慮把我的女兒帶回去加拿大。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '沒有...如果我要回加拿大的話是因為我媽媽又老又生病了'

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
And now i am going to ask your wife some question.You are not live with your husband now, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Are you not living with your husband now?'

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes,we have already separate for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'separate' should be in the past tense to agree with the subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
So when do you seek for divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So you mean that far before…you ….seek divorce, you have already separate for some time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
Can you tell me your living standard….i mean…who lives with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my second son…
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '第一任婚姻的兒子' as 'second son' instead of 'first son'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? so ……..
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the question about the number of marriages.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the child rearing case we dicuss here is your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'child rearing case' instead of 'child custody case'.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is about eight month.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the plural subject 'years'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
After you leave your house, your daughter stay with you or hisband.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'stay' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'stays' instead of 'stay'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When i leave my husband, since my daughter is still small, so the daughter….
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'When I leave my husband, my daughter is still small.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the daughter needed the mother's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So where is the child?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'now' in the translation.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
 Is there any agreement with you and your hisband?first, your daughter live with you, and now she live with your husband, why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '協議' as 'agreement' instead of 'husband'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '原來' which means 'originally'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '女兒' which means 'daughter'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '現在' which means 'now'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '他' which means 'him'.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I move out, the  place where we were live is a little bit smaller than my husband’s house. So I think the environment is better for the children, so I give my daughter to my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'the place where we were live' is incorrect. It should be 'the place where we lived'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'give my daughter to my husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '把孩子交給先生'. It should be 'give custody of my daughter to my husband'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So if objective condition is not change, you still don’t have….better…so why do you want to get custody of your daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter, I cannot bear not to see her in the future. Beside, my husband is canadian, and he don’t have a regular job, and he may lost her job and go back to Canada. in that case, I will never see my daughter.That’ why I want the custody of my daughter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '懷胎十個月' as 'daughter' instead of 'pregnant for ten months'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'don't' instead of 'doesn't' to agree with the singular subject 'husband'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the mother being pregnant for ten months.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the husband's job not being stable and the possibility of him going back to Canada.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the mother wanting to fight for custody of her daughter.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Can you elaborate how do you raise your daughter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'financially' which is important in the context of discussing how to afford the daughter's expenses.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'raise' before the subject 'you', which is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'How do you raise your daughter?'

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Since we are still in divorce case. as for the environment, it’s fit for my daughter. as for my finical statement, I have already provide the asset list for the courts other than that I have a regular job, it’s about forty thousand a month.So I think I have ability to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'as for the environment, it’s fit for my daughter.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'as for my finical statement, I have already provide the asset list for the courts.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'I have a regular job, it’s about forty thousand a month.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after the introductory phrase 'as for the environment'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the specific details about the house that make it suitable for the daughter's growth.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the specific details about the financial statement and the asset list provided to the court.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the specific details about the job and the monthly income.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
May I ask about your divorce case?Do you know when will the result revil?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the current status of the divorce case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the expected judgment date.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. We have another court this week. I want to ask the judge, for the divorce case, I hope the verdict will come out soon.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I hope the verdict for the divorce case will come out soon.'

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok now we will arrange social workers for the both side. And the evaluation will be about how you take care of your daughter. We will refer the the report and decide what is better for your daughter. and before that,will you both side consider share the custody?As for the share custody, it’s mean that the daughter live with after and mother for sometime.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And the evaluation will be about how you take care of your daughter.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the social workers visiting both parties in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court considering the social workers' report in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court making arrangements for the child based on the evaluation and report in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'will you both side consider share the custody?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '共同撫養' as 'share the custody' instead of 'joint custody'.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人來說，我不太喜歡這個提議，因為我的女兒還太小，他也只有八個月大而已。我不想要讓他經歷我跟我老婆這段破碎的關係。對於年紀這麼小的女兒來說，他應該會覺得突然跟爸爸或是媽媽住是一件很奇怪的事情。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree my husband at this point. my daughter is too small, she is not okay for this kind of resolution.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'daughter'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '共同撫養的安排方式' as 'this kind of resolution', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '共同撫養' (co-parenting).

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay, so we arrange the social worker for evaluation first.After they finish report,we will arrange the court for another day to let both party has chance to elaborate their right.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After they finish the report, we will arrange the court for another day to let both parties have a chance to elaborate their rights.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'the' before 'social worker evaluation'. The correct translation should be 'arrange the social worker for evaluation first.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'the' before 'court'. The correct translation should be 'arrange the court for another day.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'their' before 'rights'. The correct translation should be 'let both parties have a chance to elaborate their rights.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我沒有問題
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of social workers' visits.

沒有問題，謝謝。
i am fine, too.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
In the preparatory procedure today, we want to know your opinions about child rearing. And I also want to know why both of you think you are more suitable for the child. Please elaborate this detail.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Now I am going to ask the plaintiff some questions. Plaintiff, why do you fight for the custody of your child? As I know, you don’t have a full time job now, in Taiwan. And also you are a foreigner. Why do you think you are suitable for your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think you are suitable for your child?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks why the plaintiff believes they are suitable for custody, while the user's translation asks why the plaintiff thinks they are suitable for their child.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望可以把小孩全權判給我有兩個原因 首先我老婆已經不跟我們住在一起了 我想要看著我的小孩長大 而且我聽說我老婆現在跟別的男人住在一起 如果真的是這樣的話 我很懷疑他能不能好好的養育我的小孩 因此我希望有全部的撫養權
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean you and your wife is going a divorcing case, but she no longer lives with you? And you think she lives with another man? Is that the reason why you don’t want her to take care of the child, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對阿 這是我主要的考量

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
As for your financial status, I mean if you get the custody, what would you do?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在是真的沒有一份全職的工作啦 可是我有很幾份兼職的工作讓我也有正常的收入  我相信我的收入足夠來養我跟我的小孩
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have many part time jobs. They are all part time jobs, so can you make sure how much money can you make per month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Can you make sure how much money you can make per month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有四到五份兼職工作 平均來說 我一個月有五萬塊 有時候如果有新case的話可能還會賺更多錢
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	case should be translated as project

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
And I also want to know if you get the custody of your child, will you go back to Canada and no longer come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask this question is that even you get the custody; your wife still had the visitation right. If you take your child back to your country, it means that you cut the tie between them. What’s your opinion about this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '隔離' as 'cut the tie' instead of 'separate'.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣住五年了 我有居留證而且我也喜歡這個地方 目前我沒有離開台灣的計畫 而且我認為我女兒有見到父母雙方的權利 我想強調的是 雖然我跟我太太正在辦離婚 可是我完全沒有要切斷他跟我女兒的關係 在打離婚官司的過程中 我也都會固定傳女兒照片給我老婆 我還安排出去的機會讓她跟女兒有相處的時間
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我已經在台灣住五年了' should be '我已經在台灣住了五年了'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean you don’t have the plain to go back to your country in a short time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
沒有我可能會回加拿大 因為我媽已經老了而且在生病 可是就算我回去也不會待很久 我甚至不會考慮要帶著女兒一起回去
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "沒有我可能會回加拿大" is incorrect. It should be "我可能會回加拿大".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb "回去" should be future tense, but it is translated as present tense "回去".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the phrase "because my mother is old and sick" which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the phrase "I won't even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me" which is an important detail in the original text.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay now I want to ask you some question. So you don’t live with your husband now, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'you don't live' instead of 'you don't lives'.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have lived apart for 6 months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'lived' should be in the past tense to agree with the subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case of divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you file the case of divorce?'

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'submitted' in their translation.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That is, long before you sued for divorce, you don’t lived together.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So who do you live with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son from my first marriage.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about living together with the son from the first marriage.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? so you and the plaintiff’s marriage is…?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'husband' is not an accurate translation for '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the custody we are saying now, is your second child, your daughter, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly refers to the custody as the second child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user uses 'is' instead of 'are' to match the plural subject 'we'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omits the mention of 'you' as the second person in the conversation.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
So how old are your son and daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My sun is seven years old now, and my daughter is 8 months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'sun' should be 'son' to match the subject 'my'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be 'was' to indicate past tense.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, your daughter lived with you or him?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out, our daughter was only two months old. She still needed lot of cares, so she lived with me.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'She lived with me' instead of 'She lived with me.'

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Then, presently, who does she live with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now she lives with my husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation changes the meaning of the original text. 'Now she lives with my husband' implies that the daughter is currently living with the husband, while the original text states that the daughter is currently with the husband.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter originally lived you, but now with him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '中間有什麼協議' as 'Is there any agreement between you and your husband?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation 'Why your daughter originally lived you, but now with him?' has incorrect word order.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place I live now is smaller, and the original house I lived with my husband is bigger. Considering about the environment, I think the old house is better for my daughter, so I took her back to live with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Considering about the environment' is incorrect. It should be 'Considering the environment'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I took her back to live with my husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '我把孩子交給先生'. It should be translated as 'I entrusted my child to my husband'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So considering about the objective circumstance, I mean the space of your house, it’s still worse for her, isn’t it? Then why would you want the custody of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
Come on, I borne her! How would you think I don’t want to see her in the future? Also my husband is a Canadian, and his job is Taiwan is not stable so he may go back to Canada anytime. In that case, doesn’t that mean I can see my daughter anymore? So I want to have the custody of my daughter.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form 'borne' instead of 'born'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'How would you think' instead of 'How could you think'
grammar and structure	tense errors	inconsistent use of present tense ('don't want') and future tense ('will go')
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '懷胎十個月' as 'borne her' instead of 'born her'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '生下來的' in 'I borne her'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '阿' in 'I borne her'

semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '她' in 'I borne her'

semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '而且' in 'Also my husband is a Canadian'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定' in 'his job is Taiwan is not stable'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '隨時有可能會回去加拿大' in 'he may go back to Canada anytime'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '那這樣子的話' in 'In that case'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '我不就見不到女兒了嗎' in 'doesn’t that mean I can see my daughter anymore'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權' in 'So I want to have the custody of my daughter'

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Can you tell me how would bring up your child? With your financial status.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far, we are still dealing with the divorcing case. I want to fight for the right to live in the house which my husband lives now, after our divorce. So consider about the environmental issue, the house will suit my daughter a lot. As for my financial status, I have given the court an asset list. Also, I have a regular income; it’s about 40000 per month. So I think I have the ability to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'So far, we are still dealing with the divorcing case' is incorrect. It should be 'We are still dealing with the divorcing case so far.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'fight for the right to live in the house' is a mismatched meaning. It should be 'fight for the right to live in the house after our divorce.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'So consider about the environmental issue' is incorrect. It should be 'Consider the environmental issue.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the house will suit my daughter a lot' is a mismatched meaning. It should be 'the house will be suitable for my daughter's growth.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'As for my financial status, I have given the court an asset list' is incorrect. It should be 'I have given the court an asset list for my financial status.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Also, I have a regular income; it’s about 40000 per month' is incorrect. It should be 'I also have a regular income, which is about 40000 per month.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'So I think I have the ability to take care of my daughter' is a mismatched meaning. It should be 'So I believe I am capable of raising and taking care of my daughter.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So how your divorcing case is goes now? Do you know when will the court’s decision come out?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'divorcing' instead of 'divorce' which is an incorrect word choice.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorcing case going now?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the information about the court's decision in their translation.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not very sure about that. We will go to the court this Friday. I will ask the judge of our divorcing case to make the decision as soon.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, then I will sent the social to do to visit both of your houses. And make an evaluation of how you get along with your daughter. And I will take their report into consideration to decide what’s best for the child. Before that, I want to ask both of you, would you consider about sharing shared custody of your daughter? The shared custody goes like that, your daughter will live with you sometime, and the other time lives with your husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Okay, then I will sent the social to do to visit both of your houses.' The correct word order should be: 'Okay, then I will send the social worker to visit both of your houses.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'And make an evaluation of how you get along with your daughter.' The correct form should be: 'And make an evaluation of how you get along with your daughter.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'And I will take their report into consideration to decide what’s best for the child.' The correct form should be: 'And I will take their report into consideration to decide what is best for the child.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence: 'Before that, I want to ask both of you, would you consider about sharing shared custody of your daughter?' The correct form should be: 'Before that, I want to ask both of you, would you consider sharing custody of your daughter?'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不支持這個 因為我女兒還在小了 他只有八個月大耶 我不想要她一直在我跟我老婆之間一直改變環境 對一個這麼小的小孩來說 他會混淆吧 如果他真得要這樣跟我住一段時間又跟她住一段時間
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out critical context

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree with my husband in this. She is too small, it shouldn’t to this way.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'it shouldn’t to this way.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'also not suitable' in the translation.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay, then, I will arrange the social worker to your houses first. After the make the report, we will set the court date to let both of you have a chance to make a statement, is that okay with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'After the make the report' should be 'After they make the report'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'social worker' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好啊 社工要來我可以
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I am fine with that, too.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today we are here for the preparation procedure of custody case for Ferry Johnson and Tsai-yun Shih. Do both parties have the lawyer?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有請律師
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
In today’s procedure, I want to know what the idea of both parties in custody is. I also want know why both of you think that you are suitable for getting the custody. Please focus on it as your statement. Besides, you are also having the divorce case. So I want both of you would not have verbal attack to each other.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'what the idea of both parties in custody is' is incorrect. It should be 'what the idea of both parties is in custody'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'getting' should agree with the subject 'both of you', so it should be 'both of you think that you are suitable for getting custody'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'are having' should be in the present continuous tense to match the context, so it should be 'you are also having the divorce case'.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
At first I will ask some questions to plaintiff. Why you want to get the custody of your child? As I know, you don’t have the full-time job in Taipei. Also, you are a foreigner. In the case of custody, why you strive for rearing your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of asking questions to the plaintiff.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of asking why the plaintiff believes they are more suitable.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the mention of the plaintiff being a foreigner.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我之所以希望能得到全部的撫養權有兩個原因。首先，我老婆不再與我們住在一起了，我希望能看著我小孩長大。再來，我聽說我老婆現在跟別的男人住在一起，如果真的是那樣的話，我很懷疑我女兒能得到全然的照顧。因此我希望擁有全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence structure.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean you are no longer live together though you are under the case of divorce? Also, you doubt that she is living together with another man. I that circumstances, you don’t want to share the custody with your wife?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這是我主要考慮的一些因素。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural context of the original text.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Otherwise, concerning your financial status, if you get the custody of your daughter, how would you raise your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'how would you raise your child?' instead of 'how would you child raise?'

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
雖然我現在沒有正職工作是真的，但是我有好幾份兼職工作讓我有固定的收入。我相信這足夠讓我和我女兒過活。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb phrase '是真的' should come after the subject '我'.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Can you promise that you have regular income?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均會有四到五個兼職，總共來說我大概會有五萬的收入。有時如果有另外的案子我可以有更多的收入。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I have a further question, is that possible to bring your child to Canada and no more back to Taiwan after you get the custody? The reason why I ask so because even you get sole custody, your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring your child back to Canada, you are separating your wife and child. What’s your idea to this point?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of custody and visitation rights in their translation.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年，我有居留證，而且我也愛這個地方。目前我沒有要離開台灣。另外我也覺得我的女兒有權利可以看到她的爸爸媽媽。雖然我和我老婆正在打離婚官司，我絕對沒有意圖想阻止我女兒與老婆之間的聯繫。在我跟我老婆打離婚官司的過程中，我仍會定期傳女兒的照片給她。我也有鼓勵她多與我們相處。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我絕對沒有意圖想阻止我女兒與老婆之間的聯繫' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我絕對沒有意圖想阻止我女兒與老婆之間的聯繫'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So recently you don’t plan to back to Canada?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'So, you don't plan to go back to Canada recently?'

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
我有可能會回去加拿大因為我媽媽年老且生病。但就算我回去我也不會待很久。我甚至不會想帶我女兒一起回加拿大。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我有可能會回去加拿大' is incorrect. It should be '我有可能會回去加拿大'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb '回去' should be future tense, so it should be '我有可能會回去加拿大'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the mother being old and sick in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not considering the possibility of taking the daughter with them in the translation.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay I have some question to ask the opposite position. Aren’t you living with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
No, we haven’t lived together for six months.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce suit?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
It might be two months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is 'I'.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So you didn’t live together before you file the lawsuit, right?.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So what’s your living situation, I mean, who do you live together with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son of my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
The first marriage? What time is the marriage with plaintiff?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '告訴人' as 'plaintiff' instead of 'the person who told you'

他是我第二任先生。
He is the second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'husband' in a more formal sense.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
null

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? And how old is your daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out the house, who was your daughter with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because my daughter was only two months old when I was moving out. She needed my care so she was with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they moved out.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'she was' instead of 'she is' to describe the current situation.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Where is daughter with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
My daughter is with my husband now.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter was first with you and now she is with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你們中間有什麼協議嗎' as 'Is there any agreement between you and your husband?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation 'Why your daughter was first with you and now she is with your husband?' has incorrect word order.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place where I am living is smaller than the house when I lived with my husband. I think, environmentally, it is good for my daughter to live with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The place where I am living is smaller than the house I lived in with my husband.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I think' is not present in the original text and changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the reason for giving the child to the husband, which is '環境上來說，對孩子比較優' (environmentally, it is good for my daughter).

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So in the objective circumstances, if it isn’t changed, it isn’t good for your daughter to live with you. Why you still want the custody of your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I had ten months pregnant to give birth to her. She is my child. And my husband is a Canadian, also he doesn’t have the full-time job, he might go back to Canada any time. If so, I would not see my daughter any more. So I want to be granted with the custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of gestation period

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
To your financial status, can you clarify how you raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are under the case of divorce. I hope that I can get the right to live in the house which my husband is living in after divorcing. That house is good for my daughter to grow. Also I provide a asset list to the court to make clear my financial status. In addition, I have full-time job and my wage a month is up to forty thousands. I think I capable to take care and raise my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'That house is good for my daughter to grow.' It should be 'That house is good for my daughter to grow in.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'I have full-time job and my wage a month is up to forty thousands.' It should be 'I have a full-time job and my wage a month is up to forty thousand.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'I think I capable to take care and raise my daughter.' It should be 'I think I am capable of taking care and raising my daughter.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How’s going with your divorce case? Do you know when is the court’s decision? Or the maybe-date?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case going?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the current status of the divorce case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the question about the expected date of the court's decision.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the request for a general idea of when the court's decision will be made.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. We will have the court date this Friday. I want to inform the judge of the divorce case…………
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, I will arrange the social worker to visit both of you. And make evaluations separately between both of you and your daughter. It will be the reference to the court decision of the custody. Before that, will you want to share the custody? To the definition of shared custody, it means, in a period of time, the child is with father, then, in another period of time, the child is with mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'It will be the reference to the court decision of the custody' is incorrect. It should be 'It will be the reference for the court decision of the custody.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence 'And make evaluations separately between both of you and your daughter.' It should be 'And make evaluations separately between both of you and your daughter.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'share' is used instead of 'hold' in the sentence 'Before that, will you want to share the custody?' It should be 'Before that, will you want to hold the custody?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'in a period of time' is used instead of 'for a period of time' in the sentence 'To the definition of shared custody, it means, in a period of time, the child is with father, then, in another period of time, the child is with mother.' It should be 'To the definition of shared custody, it means, for a period of time, the child is with father, then, for another period of time, the child is with mother.'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
個人來說，我沒有很喜歡這個主意，我女兒還太小。她才八個月大，我不想要她年紀那麼小就經歷那麼多變動。對這麼小的小孩而言，一下跟爸爸住一下跟媽媽住可能會讓她覺得困惑。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'favor' as '喜歡' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'favor' in this context. It should be translated as '支持' or '贊同'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'arrangement', so it should be translated as '這個安排是' instead of '這個主意是'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the changes between the parents and only mentions staying with one parent at a time.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
In that point, I agree with my husband. It’s too young to my daughter.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay I get it. I will arrange the visit of social worker. After the evaluation, we will arrange another court date to make opportunities that both parties can state. Is that okay with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I will arrange the visit of a social worker.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of waiting for the social worker's report before arranging another court date.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of giving both parties an opportunity to express their opinions during the court date.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好的我對社工人員的探訪沒有意見。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
It’s fine with me, thank you.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today’s purpose is to realize the position of you two about child rearing. And I hope that I can know that why do you to all think that yourself are suitable to raise this child. please elaborate this point in detail. In addition, I know that you are also in the divorce procedure, so I hope that both of you do not have any verbal attack to  each other in today’s court, it that ok with both of you?

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Please tell me that why you want to fight for the custody? I know that you don’t have a full time job in Taiwan, and you are also a foreigner. As for fighting for child rearing , why do you think that you are suitable for ?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think that you are suitable for fighting for child rearing?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '爭取子女撫養權' as 'fighting for child rearing' is incorrect. It should be translated as 'fighting for custody'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail that the person is asking why the speaker thinks they are suitable for fighting for custody, given their lack of a full-time job and being a foreigner.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望我能獲得我女兒全部的撫養權。首先,我老婆早就不跟我們一起住了。我想陪著我女兒長大。再者，我早就聽聞我老婆已經跟另外一個男生住在一起了。如果這是真的，我非常懷疑我老婆是不是能給我女兒一個最完善的照顧。因此，我希望我可以獲得全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我希望我能獲得我女兒全部的撫養權' (I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter). The correct word order should be '我希望能獲得我女兒全部的撫養權' (I hope to be granted the sole custody of my daughter).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我希望我能獲得我女兒全部的撫養權' (I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter) is translated as 'I hope I can get all the custody of my daughter' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'sole custody'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase '因此，我希望我可以獲得全部的撫養權' (Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody) is translated as 'Therefore, I hope I can get all the custody' which omits the word 'sole' and does not accurately convey the intended meaning.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that although you are in divorce procedure, your wife hasn’t lived with you. Moreover, you also suspect that your wife has already lived with another guy? In this situation, you don’t want to let your wife take care of your child, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的,這些是我的疑慮
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
besides, as for your personal financial status, how do you take your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
的確，我現在是沒有全職工作。但是我有很多份兼職工作可以有穩定的收入。我相信這些收入夠我可以照顧我自己以及我女兒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
Yu just mentioned that you have several part time jobs so far。Because they are all part time jobs, can you estimate that how much fixed income do you earn each month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'You just mentioned' instead of 'Yu just mentioned'.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有四到五份兼職工作。總共大概每個月可賺五萬塊。有時候，如果我有接到新的案件，就可以賺到更多錢。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I want to ask you another question, which is that will you bring your daughter back to Canada and never come back after you are granted with sole custody. The reason why I ask you this question is that even if you are granted with sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your kid back to Canada, which means that you separate your daughter and wife. What’s your opinion about this?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's opinion or perspective on the matter.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待五年了。我有居留證號碼，而且我也喜歡這個地方。目前我沒有打算離開台灣。特別是我覺得我女兒應該要有權利可以看到她麼爸媽。我意思是，雖然我跟我老婆正在打離婚官司，我也沒有意思要打斷他們兩個之間的聯繫。甚至在官司期間，我固定會寄女兒的照片給我老婆。我甚至都會安排外出活動，鼓勵他多花時間跟我跟我女兒在一起。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我覺得我女兒應該要有權利可以看到她麼爸媽' is incorrect. It should be '我覺得我女兒應該要有權利可以看到她的爸媽'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '打斷' should agree with the subject '我', so it should be '我沒有意思要打斷'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '待' should be in the past tense to match the time frame mentioned in the original text. It should be '我已經在台灣待了五年了。'
grammar and structure	agreement errors in number or gender	The pronoun '她麼爸媽' should be '她的爸媽' to agree in gender and number with the possessive pronoun '她'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user having an ARC (Alien Resident Certificate) in Taiwan, which is an important detail mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user regularly sending their daughter's pictures to their wife during the divorce case, which is an important detail mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user arranging outings to encourage the wife to spend time with them and their daughter, which is an important detail mentioned in the original text.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
you mean that you don’t have intention of going back to your hometown recently, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
對。我可能會回去是因為我媽媽老了也生病了。即使我回家加拿大，我也不會待很久。我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒一起去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我回家加拿大" is incorrect. It should be "我回加拿大家".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb "回去" should be consistent with the tense of the verb "回家加拿大". It should be "我可能會回去" instead of "我可能會回去".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker's mother is sick.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
now I am going to ask the other party that do you live with your husband now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
yes, we have been separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the plural subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
when do you …….
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
about two months ago
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'submitted' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
that is to say, you have been separated before you sue for divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
what’s your ………., I mean, who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son …………
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the user's first marriage.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? What the …….
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used an inappropriate word ('…….') instead of providing a proper translation for the omitted text.

他是我第二任先生。
he is my second husband
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'husband' depending on the context.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
so whom you are fighting for child rearing is …………………..
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對。
yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
how old is your son? And how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
my son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight month old
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the plural subject 'months'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
so when you move out, whom does your daughter lives with ,you or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'lives' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'does your daughter live' instead of 'does your daughter lives'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
when I move out, my daughter is only two month old, she still needs me, so she lived with me.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'lived' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'lives' instead of 'lived'.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
where is your daughter now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '那現在孩子在誰那裏？' as 'where is your daughter now?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks 'Who is the child with now?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
she lives with my husband now.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you have any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter lived with you before and now she lives with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '中間有什麼協議' as 'Do you have any agreement between you and your husband?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation 'Why your daughter lived with you before and now she lives with your husband?' has incorrect word order. It should be 'Why did your daughter live with you before and now she lives with your husband?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
where I move in is smaller than that which my husband lived. As far as environment is concerned, it’s better for child, so I let my daughter live with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'where I moved in' instead of 'where I move in'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '比較優' as 'better for child' is incorrect. It should be 'better for the child'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker is referring to their daughter. It should be 'so I let my daughter live with my husband'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
if there is ………., your environment condition is not good for your daughter, right? Why do you still want to fight for child rearing?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the specific condition that would make the environment not good for the daughter.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
………, how can I bear that I cannot see her anymore? My husband is Canadian, he doesn’t have steady job in Taiwan, he may go back to Canada anytime. In that way, I will no longer see my daughter. So , I hope I can fight for child rearing.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
as for your financial status, can you further elaborate that how do you afford your daughter’s arising expenditure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Can you further elaborate on how you afford your daughter's arising expenditure?'

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
we are still in divorce procedure, so I hope that I can live in the house where my husband is living in. as for the environment, that would be suitable for my daughter. As for my personal financial status, I have provided the court with an asset list. Besides that, I have a regular income which is at least 40000 dollars. I think that I am able to raise my daughter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the ongoing divorce procedure, which is an important detail in the original text.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
……… when does your sentence will make. That is to say,……
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. We will attend the court on Friday. I hope that I can express my opinion of making the sentence done.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
alright, the court will arrange social worker to pay a visit to both of you and make a evaluation focus on how do you get along with your daughter. The court will decide which arrangement is better for child depends on their reports. Before that, I would like to ask you that will both of you consider keeping shared custody which means your child will live with father for some time and live with mother for another time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Before that, I would like to ask you that will both of you consider keeping shared custody' is incorrect. It should be 'Before that, I would like to ask both of you if you would consider keeping shared custody.'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人是不喜歡這樣的安排，因為我女兒還太小。他只有8個月大。我不想要他跟著我們的決定兩地奔波。對於一個這麼小的小孩，這些對他來說實在是太困惑了，一下要跟媽媽住，一下又要跟爸爸住。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form '他' should be '她'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of 'changes between me and my wife' as '跟著我們的決定兩地奔波'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time'

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
as for this, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small; she should not, and is not suitable for this kind of arrangement of shared custody
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I agree with my husband on this point.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the information about the daughter being too young for shared custody.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The translation adds the phrase 'and is not suitable for this kind of arrangement of shared custody', which is not present in the original text.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
since that, we will arrange social worker to visit you first. After they finishing their reports, we will arrange the court date and …….
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about giving both parties an opportunity to express their opinions.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我也同意社工探訪.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today, we are here for the preparation procedure of Mr. Johnson and Miss. Shih, their child rearing case. Do both parties have lawyers?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我有委託律師。
Yes, I have my lawyer.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有請律師。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today, the judge mainly wants to know the idea of both parties on the child rearing case. I also want to know the reasons why do you think you are suitable to raise the children. Please answer the question to me. Also, I know you are dealing with the divorce case. Therefore, I don’t want to see any situation of verbal attack, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Please answer the question to me' is incorrect. It should be 'Please answer the question for me.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'do' in the sentence 'Therefore, I don’t want to see any situation of verbal attack, do you understand?' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'do I understand?'

I understand.
我了解

了解。
I understand.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I want to ask few questions for the plaintiff. Why do you want to get the rearing right of your children. In my understandings, you don’t have the full-time job in Taiwan. And you are a foreigner. Why do you think that you are more suitable for raising your children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think that you are more suitable for raising your children?'

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望我可以得到我子女全部的扶養權，就以下這幾點。首先，我妻子已經沒有再跟我們住在一起了，我希望我可以陪伴著我孩子成長。此外，我還知道我太太跟其他男人住在一起，如果真是如此，我很懷疑她是否真能給我們的孩子最好的照顧。因此，我希望可以得到全部的扶養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我希望我可以得到我子女全部的扶養權' should be '我希望可以得到我子女全部的扶養權'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that your wife is no longer live with you even if she is still under the divorcing case? Moreover, you doubt that she is living with another man now? It is because under such circumstance that you do not want her to take care of your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，這是我主要這樣做的原因。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Regarding with your financial status, if you get the right to raise your daughter, how do you deal with your financial status? How do you have the money to take care of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有所謂正職的工作是事實啦，但是我現在也有一些打工啊，都可以帶給我固定的收入。我相信那些收入已經足夠讓我和我的女兒生活了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The adverbial phrase '是事實啦' should come after the subject '我'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '打工啊' is not an accurate translation for 'part-time jobs'. It should be translated as '兼職工作' or '臨時工作'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of having 'several' part-time jobs, which is an important detail in the original text.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because they are part-time jobs, can you calculate how much money that you are sure you can earn per month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'can you estimate how much money you are sure you can earn per month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我有四到五個打工的工作，平均來說。這大概可以讓我每個月賺五萬元左右吧。如果我有得到新的工作的話，也許這收入會更高。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Moreover, I want to know that if you have the right to raise children; will you take your child back to Canada and you will not come back ever again? I would ask this question is because even if you do get the right to raise your children, your wife may still have the visitation right for your child. If you take your child back to Canada, it will transform into the separation of the mother and the child. What your opinion about this?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the wife having visitation rights.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '隔離她們母女見面' as 'separation of the mother and the child', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣住五年了。我不只有居留證我也很喜歡這裡。到目前為止，我沒有想要離開台灣的打算。而且我也認同我女兒必須要見到父母雙方。而且我也想要重申，即使我和我太太目前還在打離婚官司，我卻沒有想阻止她們母女倆互相見面的權利。就在我們還在打離婚官司時，我不時會寄我女兒的照片給太太，我還邀請我太太一起和我和女兒出去玩。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我不只有居留證我也很喜歡這裡' should be '我不只很喜歡這裡，我還有居留證'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '而且我也認同我女兒必須要見到父母雙方' should be '而且我也認同我女兒必須要見到雙方父母'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '而且我也想要重申，即使我和我太太目前還在打離婚官司，我卻沒有想阻止她們母女倆互相見面的權利' should be '而且我也想要重申，即使我和我太太目前還在打離婚官司，我卻沒有想阻止她們母女倆互相見面的權利'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '就在我們還在打離婚官司時，我不時會寄我女兒的照片給太太，我還邀請我太太一起和我和女兒出去玩' should be '就在我們還在打離婚官司時，我不時會寄我女兒的照片給太太，我還邀請我太太和我一起和女兒出去玩'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
Do you mean that you do not have the plan to go back to Canada recently?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
我也許會回加拿大，但那是因為我媽媽已經年紀很大而且又生病了。但是即使我回去了，我也不會長久待在那裡，我會讓我女兒一直和我待在一起。
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the part where the speaker states that they wouldn't consider taking their daughter with them.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我女兒一直和我待在一起' in the wrong position in the sentence.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Next, I want to ask few questions to the wife. Are you currently not living with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have already separately lived for about half a year.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorcing case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'submitted' in their translation.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
so before you file the divorcing case, both of you did not live together anymore?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not living together before filing for divorce.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
What your living condition right now? I mean who did you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son from the first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So ,which marriage is you with your current husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So, the case of rearing we are fighting now is for the daughter of your second marriage.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'the case of rearing we are fighting now'. The correct translation is 'the custody battle we are currently fighting'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order is 'the custody battle for the daughter of your second marriage'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker's gender in the translation. The correct translation should include 'your daughter' instead of just 'the daughter'.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, was your daughter with you or with your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'is your daughter with you or with him?'

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Since when I moved out, my daughter is just two months old, so she was with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needs the mother's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Where is your daughter now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '那現在孩子在誰那裏？' as 'Where is your daughter now?' which is a mismatched meaning. The correct translation should be 'Who is the child with now?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
My daughter is with my husband now.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between both parties? Why the daughter was with you first but the daughter was with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '中間有什麼協議' as 'Is there any agreement between both parties?' instead of 'What agreement do you have?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'Why was the daughter with you first, but now with your husband?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place I live after I moved out is smaller than the place my husband have. After consideration of the environment, I think the bigger house is more suitable for my daughter so I let my husband to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'the place my husband have' should be 'the place my husband has'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I let my husband to take care of my daughter' should be 'I entrusted my daughter to my husband'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstance does not change, I mean that you sill live in the smaller house, I don’t think it will be good for your child. Why do you want to fight for the rearing right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is “my” daughter, I can’t imagine if I cannot see her anymore. Besides, my husband is a foreigner from Canada. He might go back to Canada because he even does not have a full-time job in Taiwan. In that case, I might not see my daughter ever again. As a result, I want to fight for the rearing right of my daughter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '懷胎十個月' as 'imagine if' instead of 'born after ten months of pregnancy'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '生下來的' which means 'born' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '我希望能夠' which means 'I hope to' in the translation.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
From your financial status, can you explain how do you plan to cover the money to take care of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we are still on the divorce case. Now, I hope to get the court decision that my daughter and I can live in the house which my husband currently live. According to the environment, I think that house will be very suitable for the growth of my daughter. About my personal financial status, I have already given the court my asset lists. Moreover, I have the full-time job and the salary is about forty thousand NT dollars a month. I think I am able to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Now, we are still on the divorce case.' It should be 'We are still on the divorce case now.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'get the court decision' should be 'obtain a court decision' to accurately convey the meaning.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'live in the house which my husband currently live' should be 'live in the house where my husband currently lives' to indicate the correct verb tense and subject-verb agreement.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'According to the environment, I think that house will be very suitable for the growth of my daughter.' It should be 'I think that house will be very suitable for the growth of my daughter, according to the environment.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I have already given the court my asset lists' should be 'I have already provided the court with my asset lists' to accurately convey the meaning.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The phrase 'the salary is about forty thousand NT dollars a month' should be 'the salary is about forty thousand NT dollars per month' to indicate the correct preposition and clarify the frequency of the salary.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I think I am able to take care of my daughter' should be 'I believe I am capable of taking care of my daughter' to accurately convey the meaning.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
Can you tell me what stage are your divorce case in? Do you know when or around what time the court decision will be given?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What stage is your divorce case in?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the court decision in the original text.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. We will be here for the divorce case this Friday. I hope I may ask the judge of my divorce case to give the court decision as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'may' is not appropriate in this context.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific day for the court appearance.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
The court will hire the social workers to visit the houses of both parties. Also, according to the ways you dealing with your children, the social worker will evaluate it. The report will be examined by the court and we will make a decision on it. But before that, I want to ask both parties if you ever consider the shared custody? Shared custody is defined as follows, the child will firstly with the father and then he or she will latter with mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Also, according to the ways you dealing with your children, the social worker will evaluate it.' It should be 'Also, the social worker will evaluate the ways you are dealing with your children.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'The report will be examined by the court and we will make a decision on it.' It should be 'The report will be examined by the court and the court will make a decision on it.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence 'But before that, I want to ask both parties if you ever consider the shared custody?' It should be 'But before that, I want to ask both parties if you have ever considered shared custody?'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
就個人來講，我不太喜歡這種方式因為我女兒還很小，她才八個月大欸，我不想讓她經歷我和太太之間的變動，對這麼小的孩子來說，這會讓她很混亂，為什麼有時候和爸爸在一起，有時才能見媽媽呢?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
To this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young, she should not and not suitable to go through the changes.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'she should not and is not suitable to go through the changes.'

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
I see, we will arrange the social worker to visit both parties. After they write down their report, we will arrange the next court time. Then we will let both parties to state their thoughts, is it clear?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After they write down their report, we will arrange the next court time.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of arranging the social worker to visit both parties.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of giving both parties an opportunity to state their thoughts.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好，社工人員來探訪沒有問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I agree with it, thank you.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today’s preparation procedure is for Ferry Johnson and Ms. Shi for child rearing procedure.Do both parties have lawyers?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the names of the children involved in the child rearing procedure.

我有委託律師。

I also have a lawyer.
我也有，我也是。

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'I', but the user used '我也是' which means 'I am' instead of '我也有' which means 'I have'.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today I am here; my real purpose is to understand what’s your status in this child rearing. Also, I want to know why both of you think you have the right to rear this child. Please focus on this point clearly. Besides, I know you are under the procedure of the case of divorce. I hope you can avoid the verbal attacking, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Today I am here; my real purpose is to understand what’s your status in this child rearing.' The correct word order should be 'Today I am here; my real purpose is to understand your status in this child rearing.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Also, I want to know why both of you think you have the right to rear this child.' The correct word order should be 'Also, I want to know why both of you think you have the right to rear this child.'

I understand.
我瞭解。

了解。
Yes, I do.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
So now, I will ask some question for plaintiff. Why you want to fight for the right for rearing your child? As I know, you don’t have the fall-time job in Taiwan now. You are a foreigner. Why do you think you are more proper than the defense that you can rear your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'fall-time' is incorrect. It should be 'full-time'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the defense' does not make sense in this context. It should be 'the other party' or 'the defendant'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the reason for wanting to fight for the right to rear the child.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The translation does not provide any context or background information.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望能把我的孩子判給我是因為有一些考慮的。第一點，我的老婆沒有跟我們住在一起，我想在那看著我女兒長大。此外我聽說我老婆跟別人住。如果那是真的的話，我非常懷疑她是否有能力給們的女兒最好的照顧。因此我希望能得到全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我希望能把我的孩子判給我是因為有一些考慮的'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that your wife is under the procedure of a divorce case and she doesn’t live with you. Is that right? Also, you suspected that she is living with other man. Are those concerns that you think you don’t want your daughter to live with your wife?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
沒錯，那些是我主要的顧慮。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
As to your financial status, if you got the custody of your daughter, how can you raise her up?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How can you raise her up?' instead of 'If you got the custody of your daughter, how can you raise her up?'

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有全職工作是真的。但是我有幾分臨時工可以讓我有固定的收入，我認為我的收入足夠讓我和我的女兒生活。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because those jobs are part-time jobs, can you calculate how much can you earn each month?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均大約有四到五個兼職。大約可以讓我賺到一萬五千元台幣每個月。有時候如果我有新的工作的話我會有新的收入。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '大約可以讓我每個月賺到一萬五千元台幣。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'bring me' as '讓我' is not accurate. A more appropriate translation would be '給我' or '帶來給我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about having new projects and the possibility of having more income.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I have another question. If you have the custody of your daughter, will you bring her to Canada and never come back? The reason why I ask you that question is because although you have the custody of your daughter, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter to your country that means you will violate the right of your wife to visit your daughter. What’s your point about this case?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the father not returning to the country.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待了有五年了，我有居留證而且我喜歡這個地方。到目前為止我並沒有任何計畫打算離開台灣。而且我確信我的女兒有權力見到她的父母。在這裡我要強調的是:雖然我和我的老婆正在打離婚官司，但是我絕對不會切斷她們的關係。在我們打離婚官司的程序中，我時常會寄我們女兒的照片給我老婆看。我也時常安排出去，我們三個一起出遊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我在台灣已經待了有五年了' should be '我已經在台灣待了五年了'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean that recently you will not return to your mother country, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不，有可能因為我的媽媽已經年老了也生病了。即使我回去但我也不會待太久，我甚至不會考慮把我女兒一起帶去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "即使我回去但我也不會待太久" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "即使我回去，我也不會待太久".

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
so now, I will ask some question for other party. You don’t live with your husband, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'separated' should agree with the plural subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you have the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is necessary for clarity.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
Before you have the case, you didn’t live together.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the couple stopped living together before the divorce lawsuit was filed.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
Who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I bring my son of my first marriage together.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? What is your marriage time with the plaintiff?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'husband' is not an accurate translation for '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So now, we are talking about the custody of the daughter which is you and your second husband have.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is eight-year old and my daughter is eight months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'son' and 'daughter' in number.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
After you leave your home, who live with your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because when I leave my home, my daughter was only two months so I worked her out in order to take care of her.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Because my daughter was only two months old when I moved out, she still needed my care, so she stayed with me.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the daughter still needed the user's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Where is your daughter now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '那現在孩子在誰那裏？' as 'Where is your daughter now?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks 'Who is the child with now?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
My daughter is in my husband’s house.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The correct word order should be 'My daughter is at my husband's house.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you have any agreement that your daughter live with you first and later she lives with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I left my house, I live in a small house, but the original one is bigger. According to the environment, my husband’s house is better for my child.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '交給' is translated as 'for' instead of 'to'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstance that your house is not good enough, your daughter lives with your husband is a better choice, isn’t that right? Why you want to own the custody of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you want to own the custody of your daughter?'

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I spent ten months to have my daughter. How can I endure that I cannot see her in the future? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian and he doesn’t have a full-time job. Also, he may leave Taiwan to Canada. As a result, I may not see my daughter in the future. So I hope I can fight for the custody of my daughter.
semantic conversion	omission of details	omitted the fact that she gave birth to the daughter
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrectly translated '懷胎十個月' as 'spent ten months' instead of 'carried for ten months'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omitted the fact that her husband's job is not stable in Taiwan
semantic conversion	omission of details	omitted the fact that her husband may return to Canada
semantic conversion	omission of details	omitted the fact that she wants to fight for custody of her daughter

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
How can you afford the expense for your daughter in your financial status?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we are still under the procedure of divorce case. I want to have the right to live in my husband’s house after the divorce. According to the environment, my husband’s house is suitable for my daughter to grow. As to my financial status, I have provided an asset list to the court. Besides, I have a regular full-time job. I earn about forty thousand NT dollars a month. I think I have the ability to take care of my daughter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How’s your divorce case? When is the result be made about time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the current status of the divorce case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include a question about the expected time for the judgment.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. This Friday we will have a court again. I will inform the judge in that court to make the decision earlier.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I will inform the judge in that court to make the decision earlier.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the divorce case, which is important context in the original text.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok, the court will have social workers to visit both of you, you and your husband. And make the evaluation to the situation that you and your husband’s accompanying your daughter. We will see the evaluation to decide the best choice for your daughter. So before the evaluation, I want to ask both of you that can you share the custody of your daughter? What is share custody is that your daughter will live with your husband for a period of time and later she will leave with you.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'you and your husband’s accompanying your daughter'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'We will see the evaluation to decide the best choice for your daughter'
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	Missing article in the sentence: 'So before the evaluation'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence: 'can you share the custody of your daughter?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence: 'What is share custody is that your daughter will live with your husband for a period of time and later she will leave with you.'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
基本上我不太贊同這個決議，因為我的女兒太小了，她才八個月大。我不想要她在我和我老婆之間換來換去。以我女兒現在的年紀來講，如果她一下子跟她媽媽住、一下子跟她爸爸住，這會讓她搞混。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
To that point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young, so it’s not proper and should not use that method.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Ok, now we arrange the schedule of social worker first. After they make a report, we will arrange the court day to give you the opportunity to state yourself, is that ok?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Now we first arrange the schedule of the social worker.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social worker' in the sentence, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation also omits the mention of 'give you the opportunity to state yourself' in the sentence, which is another important detail.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
OK 沒問題。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'OK' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'fine' in this context.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I am ok, too.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Explain why you urged to get child rearing right. So far you don’t have the full time job in Taiwan. Basically, you are the foreigner. In this case, why did you think you have the better right to get this?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望能把所有的撫養權判給我，因為有兩個原因，首先，我太太沒有和我們住在一起，我希望能看到我女兒在這邊長大。此外，我聽到消息說我老婆和別的男人住在一起，如果情況真的如此，那我懷疑我女兒能否得到最完善的照顧，因此，我希望能得到所有的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence structure.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
In other words, your wife lived with another man when you had the divorce case. Besides, you also have the doubt she lives with another man. Under this circumstance, you are not willing to give the sole custody to her.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the wife lived with another man during the divorce case, while the original text only mentions that the wife no longer lives with the user.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the information that the wife is currently involved in a divorce case with the user.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這些就是我主要的考量

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Concerning about the financial status, if you get the custody, what will you do?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
的確，我現在沒有拿到一個全職工作，但是我有幾份兼職的工作，可以讓我保持一個穩定的收入，我相信這個金錢來源，足夠讓我養活我們
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有幾份兼職的工作'.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mention you have several part-time jobs. Because those are part-time jobs, can you tell the amount conservatively?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific information about the estimated monthly income.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我大概有四到五份兼職工作，全部總計每個月大概可以有五萬的收入，如果有接到新的企劃，說不定能賺更多。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
So, another question would be that if you get the sole custody with your daughter, would you bring her to Canada and stay in Canada forever and would not come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask this question is that even though you get the custody, your wife still has the visitation right to see your daughter. If you bring your daughter to Canada, it will become that you isolate your daughter from your wife. At this point, what is your opinion?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'would not come back to Taiwan' should be 'would not come back to Taiwan forever'.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已在台灣待了四五年，我有居留證也喜歡這個地方，目前為止，我沒有任何計畫打算離開台灣。我認為我女兒有權可以看到我們雙方，我想強調的是即便我和我老婆在打離婚官司，但沒有打算切斷她們母女之間的關係。在整個離婚訴訟中，我也常寄女兒的圖片給我妻子看，我甚至還計畫讓她和女兒一起出遊，讓他多看看我們的女兒
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我已在台灣待了四五年' is incorrect. It should be '我已經在台灣待了四五年'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我認為我女兒有權可以看到我們雙方'. It should be '我認為我女兒有權看到我們雙方'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker has an ARC (Alien Resident Certificate).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker regularly sends pictures of their daughter to their wife during the divorce case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker arranges outings to encourage their wife to spend time with them and their daughter.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
What you mean is that you have no intention to come back to Canada, Right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '母國' as 'Canada' instead of the correct translation 'home country'.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
有可能回加拿大也可能是因為我母親又老又病，所以我必須得回去，就算我回去，也不會待太久，我不會考慮帶我女兒回去的可能。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我不會考慮帶我女兒回去的可能" is incorrect. It should be "我不會考慮帶我的女兒回去的可能".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase "No, I may go back to Canada" in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase "However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long" in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase "I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me" in the translation.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
I will ask questions for the other side. You did not live with your husband, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
We are separated for at least six months.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'are' should be in the present tense to match the original text.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
 That is to say is that before you file the case, you did not live together, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So, let me ask you about your living status. I mean whom do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son who is born in my first marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'son'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? What is the marriage with the defendant?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So, you are fighting for the child rearing right. Who is the child you fight with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? How old is your daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How old is your son?' and 'How old is your daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old. My daughter is eight months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you leave out home, did your daughter come with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I left out home, I bring my daughter with me because she was just two months old at that time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'When I left home, I brought my daughter with me.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needed the user's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Who live with your daughter?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'your daughter', so it should be 'Who lives with your daughter?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
My daughter lives with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between you and him? Originally, your daughter lives with you. Why did your daughter live with him now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '有什麼協議' as 'Is there any agreement', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order should be 'Why did your daughter live with him now?' instead of 'Why did your daughter live with him now?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '中間' which means 'in between' in the original text. This omission changes the meaning of the sentence.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place I live so far is small. Originally, our house was much bigger.Concerning for the environment, I think my husband’s house is better. I get my daughter to him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'I get my daughter to him' is incorrect. It should be 'I give my daughter to him.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
 For the objective circumstance, what I mean is that if your place has no change, it would be not good for your daughter. Why did you want to get the custody?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter with hard effort. How could I live without her? Besides, my husband is Canadian and his job is not stable. He has high possibility of coming back to Canada. In this way, I may not see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I want to get the custody.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '懷胎十個月' as 'with hard effort' instead of 'carried for ten months'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '生下來的阿' as 'daughter' instead of 'gave birth to her'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'with hard effort' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'my daughter'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the user being the mother of the daughter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the husband being Canadian.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the husband's job not being stable.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the husband's possibility of returning to Canada.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the user's desire to fight for custody.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your finical status, could you explain how you afford your daughter’s raising fee?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far we are in the progress of divorce case. I want to ask where my husband lives so far. For the finical status, I think that house will be suitable for my daughter. I have provided a piece of asset for the court. In addition to that, I have stable job which I can get forty thousand each month. I think I am able to raise my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I want to ask where my husband lives so far.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'where my husband lives so far' does not accurately convey the meaning of '我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡' which means 'I hope to be able to live in the house where my husband currently resides after the divorce.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information about providing a financial statement to the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention the reason for believing that the house is suitable for the daughter's growth.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I have stable job which I can get forty thousand each month.' It should be 'I have a stable job which pays me at least forty thousand each month.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the statement '我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒' which means 'I think I am capable of raising and taking care of my daughter.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
I want to the progress of your divorce case. Do you know when will the court make the judge or which day they will give answer?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure about that. We have to go to the court this Friday. I will send my concern to judge who is undergoing our case.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I will send my concern to the judge who is handling our divorce case.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'divorce case' as 'undergoing our case,' which does not accurately convey the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about wanting the judgment to come out quickly.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
OK, the court will send social workers to both sides to see our status. They will make the evaluation about how good is daughter to one side. The court will examine the report to make the decision which one is good to your daughter. Before that, will you consider the shared custody for both sides? The shared custody means that the daughter lives with father sometimes. For another time, she will live with mother.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'evaluate' as 'make evaluation'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'how good is daughter to one side'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of 'social workers' in the translation
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of 'to one side' in the translation
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of 'shared custody' as 'daughter lives with father sometimes'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不太喜歡這樣的建議，因為我們女兒還小，他現在只有八個月大，我不希望她經歷在父母之間的轉換。對這麼小的兒童而言，一下子和爸爸住，一下又跟媽媽住，這對他們是困擾混淆的
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'changes' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在父母之間的轉換' at the end of the sentence instead of after '經歷', resulting in a word order error.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
 At this point, I am agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young, she is not able to or supposed to live this kind of environment.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'am' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I am' instead of 'I is'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'live this kind of environment' does not accurately convey the meaning of '共同撫養的安排方式' which means 'arrangement of co-parenting'.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
 In this way, the court will send social workers. After they make full report, we will arrange the date of court. By doing so, both sides have rights to make statements, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After they make a full report, the court will send social workers.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after 'After they make a full report'. The correct sentence should be 'After they make a full report, the court will send social workers.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of arranging a court date after the social workers' report. The correct translation should include the sentence 'After they make a full report, we will arrange a court date.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation also omits the mention of giving both sides the opportunity to express their opinions. The correct translation should include the sentence 'This way, both sides will have the opportunity to express their opinions.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我可以接受社工拜訪
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no further question about that.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today is the preparation procedure for the child rearing between Shi Chiai Yon and Ferry Johnson. Do both party have the lawyer?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today, judge wants to clarify your different point of view on this custody case. And I would like to know that why both of you think that you’re more appropriate to raise this child. Please say your statement according to this point. And I also know that you’re on the divorce trial. Therefore, I hope there would be not(no) verbal attack in this court.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'And I would like to know that why both of you think that you’re more appropriate to raise this child.' The correct word order should be 'And I would like to know why both of you think that you’re more appropriate to raise this child.'
grammar and structure	omission of details	The word 'not' is missing in the sentence 'Therefore, I hope there would be not verbal attack in this court.' The correct sentence should be 'Therefore, I hope there would not be any verbal attack in this court.'

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I would like to ask some questions to the plaintiff. Why do you want to ask for the right of child rearing? As I know, now you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan. Plus, you’re also a foreigner. When it comes to the child rearing, why do you think that you’re more appropriate to raise the child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of asking questions to the plaintiff.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of asking why the plaintiff thinks they are more appropriate to raise the child.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我想要請求我孩子的扶養權基於以下兩個原因。首先我的太太現在已經沒有和我同住了。我想要看著我的孩子成長。此外我也聽說我的太太現在和另一名男子同住，所以就此原因我很懷疑她是否能夠好好照顧小孩，因此我想要要求全權的扶養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我想要要求全權的扶養權' should be '我想要要求全權扶養權'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that though you’re still on the divorce trial, you two didn’t live together now? Also you doubt that she is live with another man? Is that the reason that you don’t want to give your daughter to be taken care from(by) her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Is that the reason that you don’t want to give your daughter to be taken care from(by) her?' is incorrect. It should be 'Is that the reason that you don’t want to give your daughter to her to be taken care of?'

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這是我主要的考量。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
In addition, as for the financial status, if you have the custody, how would you like to raise your daughter?

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
事實上，我現在的確沒有全職的工作。但是我現在有打好幾份工、有固定的收入，我認為我的收入足夠養活我自己和我的女兒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb phrase '有打好幾份工' should come before the subject '我'.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
Do you mention that you have several part-time jobs? Because they’re all part-time jobs, so can you promise that how much you will receive as regular income per month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均會打四到五個工。大概總收入是五萬元。有時候如果我接到新的工作，我就會有更多的收入。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我平均會打四到五個工' is incorrect. It should be '我平均會打四到五個工作'.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The word 'part-time' is missing in the translation. It should be '我平均會打四到五個兼職工作'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'bring' should be in the future tense to match the original text. It should be '他們將會給我大約五萬元的收入每個月'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about having new projects and the possibility of earning more income. It should be '有時候，如果我有新的專案，我可能會有更多的收入'.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another question is that would you bring your daughter back to Canada if you get the custody. The reason why I’m asking this question is that even if you receive the custody, but your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada that means you use another way to separate your daughter and your wife and that’s violated the visitation right. What do you have to say upon this point?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the custody being for the daughter.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了。我已經拿到居留證了而且我也很喜歡這個地方。至今我還沒有要離開台灣。尤其我也認為我的女兒應該要有權力可以時常看到她的雙親。我想要強調的是儘管我們現在正在打離婚訴訟，但我並沒有想要把她和我太太拆散的意思。在我們打離婚官司的期間我常常有寄女兒的照片給她啊。我甚至有安排她們一起出去讓她們有更多的機會相處。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我已經拿到居留證了而且我也很喜歡這個地方' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我已經拿到居留證了，而且我也很喜歡這個地方。'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence '我想要強調的是儘管我們現在正在打離婚訴訟，但我並沒有想要把她和我太太拆散的意思。' The correct form should be '我想要強調的是儘管我們現在正在打離婚訴訟，但我並沒有想要把她和我太太拆散。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'my daughter' in the sentence '我想要強調的是儘管我們現在正在打離婚訴訟，但我並沒有想要把她和我太太拆散的意思。' The correct translation should include '我女兒' to indicate 'my daughter'.
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	The translation does not include the cultural reference of 'ARC' (Alien Resident Certificate) in the sentence '我已經拿到居留證了而且我也很喜歡這個地方。' The correct translation should include '外僑居留證' to accurately convey the meaning.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
Do you mean that you don’t have the intention to go back to Canada recently?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
 不會，我只是可能會因為我母親年長而且生病的原因回去而已。就算我回去了我也不會待太久。我更不會考慮說會把女兒帶過去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我只是可能會因為我母親年長而且生病的原因回去而已' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只是可能因為我母親年長而且生病的原因回去而已'.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
 Then I would like to ask a few questions to the other party. Are you living with your husband now or not?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes. We separated for about six month.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'separated' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'We separated' instead of 'We separated'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you raise the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Maybe about two month ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is crucial for understanding the context.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That means before you filed the divorce case you two hadn’t lived together, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
Now do you live with someone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son and is from my ex-husband.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'son', so it should be 'is from my ex-husband'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
You said that your son belongs to your first husband, so what is(how about) this time?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So let me clarify this. The daughter is the children(child) between you and your second husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'children' was translated as 'child', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and mu daughter is just eight months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you went out to live, whom did your daughter stay with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I lived out, my daughter is just two months, so my daughter needs a lot of care, so she lived with me at that time.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense 'was' to match the past tense of 'lived out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the daughter still needs the user's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Now, who have(has) the child now?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'child', so it should be 'has' instead of 'have'.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
She lives with my husband now.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you have any agreement? Why did your daughter live with you and now don’t(doesn’t) and lives with your husband now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '協議' as 'agreement' instead of 'arrangement'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'don't' instead of 'doesn't' to match the singular subject 'daughter'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'live' in the second part of the sentence, resulting in a missing verb.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'husband' in the second part of the sentence, resulting in a missing noun.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
I moved to a smaller place and my husband’s home is bigger, so my daughter stays with him. It’s a more appropriate environment for my daughter, so I leave my daughter to him.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is referring to her husband as '先生' (husband) in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'leave' instead of 'leaves' in the sentence 'so I leave my daughter to him', resulting in subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is referring to her daughter as '孩子' (child) in the original text.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances, I mean the living environment, don’t change, it’s still not good for your daughter, right? Then why would you like to file for the custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why would you like to file for custody?'

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I was pregnant for totally ten months and have her. How could I leave her alone? In addition, my husband is a Canadian. He doesn’t have a regular job. He doesn’t have fixed income. And maybe one day he will go back to Canada. If that’s the case, maybe I will never see my daughter. Therefore I would like to receive my daughter’s custody.
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect use of past tense in 'I was pregnant for totally ten months and have her'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'How could I leave her alone?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in 'He doesn’t have a regular job. He doesn’t have fixed income.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'And maybe one day he will go back to Canada.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '生下來的阿' in 'I have her.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '我不就見不到女兒了嗎？' in 'maybe I will never see my daughter.'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of 'totally' in 'I was pregnant for totally ten months.'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of 'alone' in 'How could I leave her alone?'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of 'maybe' in 'And maybe one day he will go back to Canada.'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of 'maybe' in 'If that’s the case, maybe I will never see my daughter.'

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Can you explain further on the point of financial status to proof that you can raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we’re still on the divorce case. I hope the result would be that my daughter will still live at the place that my husband lives in now. That would be a really good place for my daughter to grow up. As for my personal financial status, I have provide(d) the court my asset list. In addition I have a regular income per month. Every month I receive over 40,000 dollars. I think I have the ability to raise my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in 'provide(d) the court my asset list'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Missing subject-verb agreement in 'Every month I receive over 40,000 dollars'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So how’s your divorce case? How does the process go? Is there a set time that the result will come out?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. We will have the divorce court this Friday. I hope I can state my hope to that judge that I want the result to come out soon.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Then we will sent(send) social workers to both of your parties. Besides, we will evaluate how you two take care of your child. We will consider their report and see who will be more appropriate to raise the child. Before that, I would like to ask both of you, do you have the will to have shared custody. The shared custody means that the child lives with one of the parent for a period of time and lives with the other for another period of time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	sent -> send
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	we will sent -> we will send
grammar and structure	omission of details	sent to both of your parties -> sent to both of your parties and
grammar and structure	word order errors	both of your parties and -> both parties
grammar and structure	tense errors	we will evaluate -> we will be evaluating
grammar and structure	word order errors	how you two take care of your child -> how you take care of your child
grammar and structure	word order errors	see who will be more appropriate to raise the child -> see who will be more appropriate for raising the child
grammar and structure	word order errors	do you have the will to have shared custody -> do both of you have the will to have shared custody
grammar and structure	word order errors	The shared custody means that the child lives with one of the parent for a period of time and lives with the other for another period of time -> The shared custody means that the child lives with one parent for a period of time and with the other parent for another period of time

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不是很贊成因為我們的孩子還很小。她只有八個月大而已欸，我不想要她一直經歷環境上的改變，在我和我太太之間來來去去的。對一個年紀還這麼小的孩子而言，如果她要一下跟爸爸住，一下跟媽媽住，她可能會很混亂。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this point, I agree with him. Our daughter is still young and little and it’s not appropriate to have the shared custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out critical context

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Since that, we will sent(send) the social workers first. When they hand in their report, we will set another court. Then you will have the opportunities to state your opinion.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'We will sent the social workers first.' It should be 'We will send the social workers first.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'out' in the sentence 'When they hand in their report, we will set another court.' It should be 'When they hand out their report, we will set another court.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'the' in the sentence 'Then you will have the opportunities to state your opinion.' It should be 'Then you will have the opportunity to state your opinion.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
是的，我同意讓社工來探視。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'let' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
inappropriate cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the idiomatic expression 'social workers' visits' to the target language, resulting in a literal translation that may not convey the intended meaning.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no problems.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today the court is to realize your will at child rearing. The court also like to know that each of you, what privilege you have to raise this child.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
The plaintiff, why is your reason for you to ask child rearing? As far as I know, you don’t have a full time job in Taiwan.Also you are a foreigner. In the case of strive for child rearing, what do you think you are more capable of?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits important information from the original text.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望得到我孩子全部的扶養權，因為我覺得這樣對他比較好。 第一個理由，我太太之後不會跟我們住在一起了。我想要看著我的女兒成長。而且我聽說我的太太已經跟別的男人同居一起了。如果真的是那樣的話我懷疑他能提供給我女兒一個好的環境。因此我希望我能得到全部的扶養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我希望得到我孩子全部的扶養權' should be '我希望得到全部的扶養權，我孩子'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning: '我覺得這樣對他比較好' should be '我覺得這樣對她比較好' to match the gender of '我的女兒'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of details: The user did not mention the two concerns mentioned in the original text

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that though you are still preparing divorce, and your wife has already lived with other man? And you also doubt that she lived with other man? It is because of that you don’t want your daughter to live with her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Important details from the original text are missing in the translation.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，這就是我主要考慮的原因

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
About your financial status, what are you going to do after you gain your daughter’s sole custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實是沒有一份全值的工作但是我有間很多份工作，這些工作就能提供給我穩定的收入。我認為我的收入足夠能支付我的生活和照顧我女兒
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned you have several part-time job Because all the jobs you said is part-time, can you expect how steady income every moth?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
平均來說，有四到五個兼職工作所以加總起來大概有一個月五萬塊如果有時候有些新的案件的話，我還會有些新的收入
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another question I want to ask you will you take your daughter back to Canada after you get her whole custody?The reason I ask this question is because that even of you get the sole custody, your wife may have the chance to come to see her.If you decide to bring your daughter back to your country, that will be another way that you cut the tie with her mother.About this point what is your reason?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the wife having visitation rights.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'that will be another way that you cut the tie with her mother', which is not present in the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經再台灣待了五年了我有這裡的居留證，而且我也很喜歡這邊。到目前為止我還沒有打算要離開台灣 而且我也覺得我的女兒有他的權利可以來看兩方的父母。我想澄清一點就是，雖然我和他母親正準備要離婚，但我沒有打算要切斷他們母女的聯繫 在我們打官司的這段期間，我也會固定地寄女兒的照片給她我也會安排一些活動讓我三個能一起出去。

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in sentence: '我也會安排一些活動讓我三個能一起出去' should be '我也會安排一些活動讓我們三個能一起出去'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean currently you don’t have any plan to go back to your country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
對，我有可能會回去就是因為我媽媽年老了可能生病。可是就算我回去加拿大，我也不會在那邊久留。而且我也不會考慮把我女兒一起帶回去
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "而且我也不會考慮把我女兒一起帶回去" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "而且我也不會考慮把我女兒帶回去一起".

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
So now let me ask the defendant. Now you are not live with your husband, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Now you do not live with your husband, is that right?'

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been separated for six moths.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'moths' should be 'months' to agree with the plural subject 'six'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you decided to file the case of divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two moths ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'applied' in the translation.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So you mean before you file the divorce case, you were no longer live together?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So what id you living condition? I mean, who did you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son of my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
The first marriage? So what is the time marriage with the plaintiff?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So now the custody you are fighting for is with your second husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對。
yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? How old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven yeas old and my daughter is eight months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, the daughter is with you or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'the daughter is' instead of 'the daughter are'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out, my daughter is little and she needs my taking care of.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense 'was' to match the past tense of 'moved out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter was only 2 months old at the time.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'she needs my taking care of', which is redundant and not present in the original text.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So now the child is with who?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now she is with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Now she is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between you? Why the daughter was with you and now with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '原來女兒跟你' as 'the daughter was with you' instead of 'originally the daughter was with you'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'was' before the subject 'the daughter' in the sentence 'the daughter was with you'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place I later lived is smaller, the original house with my husband is bigger. So as the living environment, the house with my husband is better for her.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So if you don’t change, change your living condition, it is still she lives with your husband is better, isn’t it? So why do you want to have the sole cutosty?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
As your financial status, can your elaborate more details how you would like to take care of your daughter?

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
May I ask the ??Do you know when the result will made?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'divorce cases' and 'progress' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure about this.We will go to the court this Friday.I will have the court that the case can be done as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, the court will plan the social workers to visit both of youThey will made the evaluations of the condition you with your childAnd the court will consider the result according to their evaluationsBefore we started that, will you consider the share custody? The shared custody means that the child with the mother for a time and with the father for the rest of time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: 'They will made the evaluations of the condition you with your child' should be 'They will make evaluations of the condition you and your child'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: 'Before we started that, will you consider the share custody?' should be 'Before we start, will you consider shared custody?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of 'the' before 'social workers' in sentence: 'the court will plan the social workers to visit both of you' should be 'the court will plan for the social workers to visit both of you'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of 'the' before 'result' in sentence: 'the court will consider the result according to their evaluations' should be 'the court will consider the result according to their evaluations'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
現階段我不同意這個做法，因為她還太小 她才八個月大我不想因為我們的關係讓她受到影響像他這麼小的小孩，要他一下跟著爸爸，一下跟著媽媽，這實在太辛苦了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree with my husband at this point.Our daughter is too young to shared custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'daughter'.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Well okay, we will arrange the social worker first.After they made the results, we will decide another date for court.To provide both of you to elaborate more.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the social worker's visit in their translation.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我可以接受社工的安排
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no further questions, thank you.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today we are going to proceed the preparatory procedure of case dealing with child rearing custody. Do both parties have your lawyer?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

我有委託律師。
Yes, I have a lawyer.

I also have a lawyer.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today the court aiming… aims at knowing the status and the thoughts of the two parties. The court would like to know the reason why each of you consider yourself is more suitable to keep the child. Please verify more… tell us more details about this… point. In addition, I know…the court knows the two parties…. is under the divorce case. So I hope that the two parties will not have any verbal attack to each other.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Plaintiff, I have some questions for you. Plaintiff, what’s the reason that you want to strive for the custody of raising your child? As far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan now. And you are a foreigner. In the case of fighting for the child rearing custody, why do you feel you will be more suitable?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What is the reason that you want to strive for the custody of raising your child?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'reason', so it should be 'What is the reason that you want to strive for the custody of raising your child?'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the plaintiff being a foreigner, which is an important detail in the original text.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user's translation adds the repetition of the word 'Plaintiff' at the beginning of each sentence, which is unnecessary.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望法院能判我女兒的全部撫養權給我, 那我有兩個理由.首先是, 我的太太已經沒有跟我們住在一起了, 我想要親眼看著我的孩子長大, 而且我也聽說我的太太已經跟別的男人同居了, 如果這事情是真的的話, 那我懷疑她有辦法給我們孩子最好的照顧, 因此我希望能得到所有的撫養權
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我希望法院能判我女兒的全部撫養權給我' should be '我希望法院能判給我女兒的全部撫養權'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我想要親眼看著我的孩子長大' should be '我想要親眼看著我的孩子長大'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我懷疑她有辦法給我們孩子最好的照顧' is translated as 'I doubt she can give our daughter the best care she deserves.' The word '照顧' means 'care' not 'the best care'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the phrase '因此我希望能得到所有的撫養權' which means 'Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.'

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean by that your wife hasn’t lived with you, even if you are now filing for the divorce case? And you also doubt that she lives with another man? Because of these situations that you are not willing to give her the right to raise the child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的,這就是我主要的原因

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
As for your personal financial status, what do you plan…..how do you plan to raise your daughter without a full-time job?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在的確沒有一份全職的工作, 但我身兼好幾份兼職工作, 而且帶給我一份穩定的收入, 我認為我賺來的錢是足夠我和我的女兒生活的

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs, since they are all part-time jobs, can you possibly count how much money you can make every month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'can you possibly count how much money you can make every month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我有四到五個兼職工作, 總加起來大概有台幣五萬塊, 如果有更多的計畫或工作給我的話, 我就可以得到更多的錢
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'on average' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another question I would like to ask you, after you have the rights…the custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and will not come back anymore? The reason why I ask you is that even if you get the custody, your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring the kid back to your country, it can be counted as a another way to cut the ties of the daughter with her mother. As for this point, what is your opinion?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits important information from the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了, 我有居留證, 而且我也喜歡這個地方, 到目前為止我並沒有打算要離開台灣, 而且我也認為我的女兒有權利見到她的雙方父母親, 我想強調的是, 雖然我和我的太太正在進行離婚官司, 但我絕對不會想要切斷他們的母子的連繫, 在我們打官司的期間, 我都會固定寄我女兒的照片給我的太太, 我也會安排出遊, 就是她和我, 以及我女兒一起出遊的機會
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我已經在台灣待了五年了' should be '我已經在台灣待了五年了'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '我女兒有權利見到她的雙方父母親' should be '我女兒有權利見到她的雙方父母親'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: '在我們打官司的期間' should be '在我們打官司的期間'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence: '我都會固定寄我女兒的照片給我的太太' should be '我都會固定寄我女兒的照片給我的太太'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in the sentence: '我也會安排出遊, 就是她和我, 以及我女兒一起出遊的機會' should be '我也會安排出遊, 就是她和我, 以及我女兒一起出遊的機會'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean that currently, recently, you don’t have the intention to go back to your country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
我可能會因為我的母親…在加拿大的母親比較老了或是病了而回國, 但就算我回去我也不會在那邊留很久, 我甚至不會考慮要把我的女兒帶去加拿大
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay I would like to ask another party. So now you don’t live with your husband now right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been separated for six months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
What’s the time when you file the divorce case
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you file the divorce case?'

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That is to say, before you file the case of divorce, you two didn’t live together.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So what’s your situation of your accommodation? I mean, who do you live with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son, which… who is from my first marriage
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	using 'which' instead of 'who' to refer to a person

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? So… what’s………. this marriage?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He’s my second husband
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'He is my second husband.'

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
The custody you’re striving for, is the custody of a daughter of your second husband, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is… are you daughter and your son?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'are' should agree with the plural noun 'daughter and son'.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is 7 year-old and my daughter is eight months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the plural subject 'children'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, was your daughter with you or with your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'was' instead.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out, because my daughter was 2 months …. in the year of 2 months, she needed me, so she was with me.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'because my daughter was 2 months old' instead of 'because my daughter was 2 months'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'old' after '2 months', which is an important detail in the original text.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
For now, where is your child, with you or your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
She is with my husband now.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The correct word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Was any agreement between you two, why was your daughter with you at first and then now with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place I moved in is smaller and the original house we lived in is bigger. Concerning the environment, I decided to give my daughter to my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I decided to give my daughter to my husband' instead of 'I decided to give my daughter to my husband.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
In the case of the objective circumstances, if your accommodation is still… that, it is not improved yet, is it better for your daughter? So why would you like to strive for the custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I borned her with 10 months. How could I bear the pain of being separated with her? Also, my husband is a Canadian, the jobs he has in Taiwan isn’t…aren’t very stable and he might go back to Canada. In that case, I cannot see my daughter anymore. That’s the reason why I would like to strive for my daughter’s custody.
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect verb form 'borned' instead of 'born'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'the jobs he has in Taiwan isn’t…aren’t very stable'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'I' in 'I cannot see my daughter anymore'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'so' in 'That’s the reason why I would like to strive for my daughter’s custody'

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Concerning your financial status, can you elaborate how would you like to arrange the money to raise your daughter?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'arrange' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'how' and 'would' in the translation.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we are under the divorce case, I hope to get the house we used to live together, that it the house my husband is living now. Concerning the environment, the house will be very suitable for my daughter to grow up. As for my financial status, I’ve provided the court…. my asset list. In addition, I have a stable job, which may have me owned 40,000 dollars at least. I think I can take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Concerning the environment, the house will be very suitable for my daughter to grow up.' The correct word order should be 'The house will be very suitable for my daughter to grow up, concerning the environment.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'As for my financial status, I’ve provided the court…. my asset list.' The correct form should be 'As for my financial status, I have provided the court with my asset list.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'I have a stable job, which may have me owned 40,000 dollars at least.' The correct form should be 'I have a stable job, which allows me to earn at least 40,000 dollars per month.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence 'I’ve provided the court…. my asset list.' The user did not specify whether the asset list was provided to the court or not.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence 'I have a stable job, which may have me owned 40,000 dollars at least.' The user did not mention the duration of the job or the frequency of the income.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
May I ask how your divorce case proceed? Do you know when the trial will be.. approximately will be?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure about that. We have to go to the court on Friday again. I will tell the court that I hope the trail and the result will come out as soon as possible
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I hope the result of the trial will come out as soon as possible.'

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok, the court will arrange the social workers to visit both parties, they will evaluate how you deal with your daughter…. The court will consider the result and decide what’s the best result for your daughter. Before that happens, I would like to ask the two parties, will you two consider the shared custody? That is, the child will accompany the mother for a period of time and then accompany with the father for another period of time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I would like to ask the two parties'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'shared custody' is translated as '共同撫養' which means 'joint custody' instead of 'shared custody'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不太喜歡這樣的決定, 因為我的女兒還太小了, 她才8個月大而已, 我不希望她在我和我妻子之間來來回回的, 對一個這麼小的孩子來說, 她會非常疑惑, 為什麼一下跟這個… 一下跟爸爸一下跟媽媽… 相處一段時間
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree with my husband at the point. Our daughter is too young, it will not be a good resolution to use the shared custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay, so we will arrange the visit of social workers first. After they make the report, we will set the court date afterward, and the both parties will have the chance to elaborate themselves, is that okay with you?

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Plaintiff, what is your reason to fight for the custody of children?As far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job regularly in Taiwan.Also you are a foreigner.In this case, why do you think you are the more appropriate person to have the custody of children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think you are the more appropriate person to have custody of the children?'

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望我可以獲得我女兒的全部撫養權，有以下兩個原因首先，我太太已經不和我們住在一起了我想要參與我女兒的成長過程此外，我還聽說我的…妻子已經和另一個男人同居了如果真的是那樣的話，我很懷疑她是不是能好好地照顧我的小孩因此，我希望我可以獲得全部扶養權
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我女兒的全部撫養權' (the sole custody of my daughter). The correct word order should be '全部撫養權的我女兒' (my daughter's sole custody).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我女兒的全部撫養權' (the sole custody of my daughter) is translated as 'the custody of my daughter' which does not convey the meaning of 'sole custody'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the reason for wanting sole custody, which is the wife living with another man and the doubt about her ability to provide the best care for the daughter.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that even you both still engage in the divorce case, your wife…already lived with another man?And you also doubt that she lived with another manBased on this situation, it is the reason why you don’t want to give the custody of children to your wife?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，那是我最主要的考量

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
In addition, concerning your personal financial status, do you really be able to raise your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實是沒有全職的工作但是我有許多的兼職工作，讓我有固定的收入我相信這些收入是足夠能讓我扶養我的女兒的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned that you have several part-time jobs.Because these jobs are all part-time, can you approximately come up the total regular income you will receive?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我大概有四到五份兼職工作平均每個月這些薪水加起來的話，大概會有五萬塊的薪水如果有時後有新的案子進來的話，我的收入就會更高
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'On average, I have four to five part-time jobs.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'bring me' as '這些薪水加起來的話' is incorrect. It should be translated as '給我帶來'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the currency 'NT$'. It should be translated as '大概會有五萬塊台幣的薪水'.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the phrase '如果有時後有新的案子進來的話' which is not present in the original text.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I also want to ask a question that if you…are granted with the custody of the child, will you bring the child back to Canada and never come back.The reason why I ask this question is that even if you are granted with the custody of the child, your wife still have the visitation right to the child.If you do bring your child back to Canada, it is kind of … behavior to cut the tie with your wife and the child.To this point, what is your explanation?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the possibility of not returning to the country after taking the child to Canada.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'are' before the subject 'you' in the first sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '變相的隔離她們母女見面' as 'cut the tie with your wife and the child', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我來台灣待了五年了我有居留證，我也很喜歡這個地方目前為止，我並沒有任何要回家加拿大的計畫我覺得我的孩子有權利見他們的父母的我想要強調的是，即使我和我的妻子仍在打離婚訴訟，但我沒有想將我的孩子與我的妻子完全隔離關係就在打離婚訴訟的期間，我也常常將孩子送去給我妻子那邊，讓他們有相處的時間我甚至還跟她約一些時間，希望她可以和我還有小孩共度一些時間
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我覺得我的孩子有權利見他們的父母的'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in sentence: '我想要強調的是，即使我和我的妻子仍在打離婚訴訟，但我沒有想將我的孩子與我的妻子完全隔離關係'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in sentence: '就在打離婚訴訟的期間，我也常常將孩子送去給我妻子那邊，讓他們有相處的時間'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in sentence: '我覺得我的孩子有權利見他們的父母的'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in sentence: '我來台灣待了五年了我有居留證'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in sentence: '我也很喜歡這個地方'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in sentence: '我並沒有任何要回家加拿大的計畫'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in sentence: '我甚至還跟她約一些時間，希望她可以和我還有小孩共度一些時間'

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
Therefore, you mean, in the recent period, you don’t have any plan to go to Canada? Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不，我還是有可能會回去加拿大的，因為我的母親很老了，而且她生病了即使我回去了，我也不會在那邊停留太久時間的我甚至不會考慮帶我的小孩一起回加拿大
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我還是有可能會回去加拿大的'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '我甚至不會考慮帶我的小孩一起回加拿大'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the mother being sick in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not staying long in Canada in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not considering taking the daughter with them in the translation.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Then I’m going to ask some questions to the other party.Do you…no longer live with your husband now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you no longer live with your husband now?'

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we …have lived separately for six months.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'have lived' should be in the present perfect tense 'have been living' to indicate an ongoing action.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
I filed the case around two months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is 'I'.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So, before you filed the divorce case, you…no longer lived with your husband already.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the couple no longer lived together before filing for divorce.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So can you tell me what is your … I mean who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son of my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? So what is … this marriage?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So now the custody … you are argue about is the daughter of your second marriage.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'the custody you are argue about', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'is' before 'the daughter', resulting in incorrect word order.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight-month old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the plural subject 'children'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out the house, was your daughter with your or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'was' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'was your daughter with you or your husband?'

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out the house, because my daughter … is still young, she went out with me.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'went' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'went out with me'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the daughter was only 2 months old at the time.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Then now … who does the child live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is living with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Now my daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why the daughter lived with you first and now is living with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '協議' as 'agreement' instead of 'husband'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'lived' before the subject 'daughter' in the translation.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I moved out, the house I lived is a little bit small. My husband’s house is bigger.In terms of the environment, I think my husband’s house is better for my child so I gave my daughter to him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'After I moved out, the house I lived is a little bit small.' It should be 'After I moved out, the house I lived in is a little bit small.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I gave my daughter to him' implies that the speaker gave their daughter away, which may not be the intended meaning. It would be more accurate to say 'I entrusted my daughter to him' or 'I left my daughter with him.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances don’t change, that is to say, …your daughter does live with your husband is a better choice.Then why do you want to be granted with the custody of your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter and I have spent ten months to give birth to her. I absolutely want her custody.In addition, my husband’s nationality is Canada. He also doesn’t have a full-time job. I’m concerning about that he might go back to Canada from time to time.In that case, doesn’t it mean that I can’t see my daughter?That is the reason why I want to be granted with the custody of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I absolutely want her custody' should be 'I want her custody absolutely'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'He also doesn’t have a full-time job' should be 'He also doesn’t have a stable job'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'I’m concerning about that he might go back to Canada' should be 'I’m concerned that he might go back to Canada'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after the phrase 'In that case'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the speaker wants to fight for custody of her daughter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the speaker's husband is Canadian.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the husband's job in Taiwan is not stable.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the speaker is concerned about not being able to see her daughter if her husband goes back to Canada.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the speaker wants to be granted custody of her daughter.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
In terms of your financial status, can you elaborate how can you raise your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far, we are still in the divorce case.I hope I can be granted with the right to live in the house of y husband.As far as the house is concerned, I think that place is pretty good for my daughter to live.As for my financial status, I already sent a document about my asset list to the court.Besides, I also have a job. Every month, I have approximately at least forty thousand dollars as an income.I think I do have the ability to raise my child.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I hope I can be granted with the right to live in the house of y husband.' It should be 'I hope I can be granted the right to live in my husband's house.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'As far as the house is concerned, I think that place is pretty good for my daughter to live.' It should be 'As far as the house is concerned, I think that place is pretty good for my daughter to live in.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'As for my financial status, I already sent a document about my asset list to the court.' It should be 'As for my financial status, I have already sent a document about my asset list to the court.'
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	Article error in the sentence 'Besides, I also have a job.' It should be 'Besides, I also have a job.'
grammar and structure	agreement errors in number or gender	Agreement error in the sentence 'Every month, I have approximately at least forty thousand dollars as an income.' It should be 'Every month, I have an income of at least forty thousand dollars.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
May I ask how is your divorce case going?Do you know when the verdict will come out about your divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case going?' instead of 'May I ask how is your divorce case going?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the part about the scheduled verdict or the approximate timing of the verdict.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure.We will have the court this Friday about the divorce case.I would like to tell the court that I hope the verdict of the divorce case will come out soon.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, we now will send some social workers to visit …both of you.In addition, they will evaluate your interaction with your child.We will …take their evaluation into account when deciding the verdict of this case.However, I want to ask that do both party would consider the joint custody.What joint custody means is that the child will spend some time with the Father and also the other time with Mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'we now will send some social workers' is incorrect. It should be 'we will now send some social workers'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'will' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'we will send' instead of 'we will send'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'send' should be in the present tense to match the context, so it should be 'we will send' instead of 'we will send'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after 'visit' to separate the two clauses in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'verdict' is not appropriate in this context. It should be 'decision' or 'outcome' instead.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'joint custody' is not accurately translated. It should be 'shared custody' or 'joint custody' instead.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of the social workers evaluating the interaction between the parents and the child.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The translation adds the phrase 'In addition' which is not present in the original text.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人是不想要這樣的裁定，因為我的女兒太小了她只有八個月大我不想她被我和我妻子之間送來送去的對於這樣歲數的小孩子來說，這樣的環境對他們來說也太混亂了吧，一下子和母親待一段時間，一下子和父親待一段時間
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我个人不想要这样的安排' (I personally do not want this arrangement).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '被我和我妻子之间送来送去' (being sent back and forth between me and my wife) is not an accurate translation of 'the changes between me and my wife'. The meaning is not properly conveyed.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '待' (stay) should agree with the subject '她' (she) in number. It should be '待一段时间' (stay for a period of time) instead of '待一段时间'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase '对于这样岁数的小孩子来说' (for a child at such a young age) is omitted in the translation, resulting in the loss of important information.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
To this point, I agree with my husband’s opinion.My daughter is too young. We shouldn’t and don’t want to accept this verdict of joint custody.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
To this case, we are going to send social workers for visitation.After social workers make the report, we will resume the case.And at that time, you will have the floor to elaborate your opinion.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'And at that time, you will have the floor to elaborate your opinion' is incorrect. It should be 'And at that time, you will have the opportunity to elaborate your opinion.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我對社工的部分沒有問題
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of being fine with social workers' visits.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I’m fine with that, too.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today we’re here for the preparatory procedure of Mr. Ferry Johnson and Ms. 彩雲石 concerning child custody. Do both parties have a lawyer?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'lawyer' from the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Your honor. Today I mainly want to verify the child custody in the marriage. I would also like to know that why both of you think that you can raise the child alone. Please elaborate this point further. Besides, I also know that both of you are also under the case of divorce. Therefore, I hope that both of you can avoid verbal attack in this court.

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence 'I would also like to know that why both of you think that you can raise the child alone.' It should be 'I would also like to know why both of you think that you can raise the child alone.'

I understand.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, defendant, may I ask you some questions? Why do you want to fight for the custody of your child? Based on my understanding, you don’t a fulltime job in Taiwan, and you’re a foreigner. In the process of the fighting for custody, what’s your advantages?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '希望能夠' as 'want to' instead of 'hope to' changes the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant not having a full-time job and being a foreigner.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that your wife is… when you’re fighting for the case of divorce, your wife no longer lives with you. Is that right? And you also doubt that she lives another man. Is it because of this kind of condition that you don’t want to share custody with her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這些都是我主要的顧慮

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Besides, concerning your financial status, if you’re granted with the custody, what do you plan to raise your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What do you plan to do to raise your child?'

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在的確沒有全職工作。但是我有很多兼職工作，這也有份固定的收入。我相信這份收入能夠支撐我和我女兒的生活。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在的確沒有全職工作。' instead of '現在的確我沒有全職工作。'

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. So because they’re all part-time jobs, so could you tell us that how much money will you gain on a regular basis.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
平均而言我有四到五個兼職工作。總共來說大概會有五萬塊的收入。有時候如果有新的計劃的時候，我也會有額外的收入。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '平均而言，我有四到五個兼職工作。'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '來說' should be in the present tense '來說'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the possibility of having more income with new projects.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
My another question is that will you bring your daughter back to Canada and no longer stays in Taiwan after you’re granted with the custody? The reason why I asked so is that even if you are granted with the custody, your wife may also be granted with the visitation right. If you bring your child back to Canada, you will become, to a degree, cut the tie between your wife and your child. To this, what’s your plea?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'daughter' in the translation, which is a critical detail in the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年。我有居留證，我也喜歡這個地方。目前為止我沒有任何離開台灣的計畫。特別是因為我認為我的女兒有權利見到爸爸媽媽。我想說的是，雖然我和我太太現在正在打離婚的官司，我從來沒有想過要切斷她和我女兒之間的聯繫。在整個離婚官司的過程中，我會固定寄女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至安排了一些行程，讓他和女兒能夠見面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我認為我的女兒有權利見到爸爸媽媽' is incorrect. It should be '我認為我的女兒有權利見到爸爸和媽媽'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean that in the short run you don’t have the plan to go back to Canada.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
我的確有回加拿大的打算，因為我母親年邁且身體不好。然而就算我回去加拿大的話我也不會待太久。我也不會考慮把女兒帶著一起回加拿大的可能。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我的確有回加拿大的打算" is incorrect. It should be "我確實有回加拿大的打算".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我也不會考慮把女兒帶著一起回加拿大的可能" is incorrect. It should be "我也不會考慮把女兒帶著一起回加拿大的可能性".

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now, Ms. 石, I have some questions for you. Don’t you live with your husband anymore?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been separated for six months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case of divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you file the case of divorce?'

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
In other words, much earlier before your filing divorce case, you no longer lives with him. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So could you tell us your living condition? I mean, who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son in my first marriage.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? What the marriage between Mr. Johnson.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He’s my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So, we’re dealing with the custody of your second husband and your daughter in your second marriage.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the ongoing dispute over child custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the plural form 'we're' instead of the singular form 'you're' to match the subject 'you'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the ongoing dispute over child custody.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter.'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, your daughter stays with who? You or your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I was moving out, because she’s only two months old, so she stayed with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needed the mother's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
What does your daughter stay with?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'stay' is not appropriate in this context. It should be 'is with' or 'is staying with'.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now she lives with my husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there some kind of arrangement between you two? Why was the daughter staying with you, and then is staying with your husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '協議' as 'arrangement' instead of 'agreement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'is' before the subject 'the daughter' in the second sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '原來' which means 'originally' in the first sentence.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The apartment after I moved out is quite smaller. The original house is bigger. In terms of the living condition, my husband can provide a better environment.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The apartment after I moved out is quite smaller.' The correct word order should be 'The apartment I moved out of is quite smaller.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the original house is bigger' is translated as 'the original house is bigger.' The correct translation should be 'my husband can provide a better environment.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is giving the children to the husband. The correct translation should include this detail: 'So, I gave the children to my husband.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances aren’t changed. Your living condition isn’t good for your daughter, isn’t it? Then why do you hope for the custody of your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question structure.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Therefore, I hope to fight for the custody. As for your financial status, could you elaborate that how you are going to raise your child.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are currently in the case of divorce. I hope that I can get my husband’s house after the case. So in terms of the living condition, that house is very appropriate for my daughter. And as for my personal financial status, I have provided the court a copy of my asset list. Besides, I have a fulltime job. I can earn around 40000 per month. I think I am able to raise my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'So in terms of the living condition, that house is very appropriate for my daughter.' The correct word order should be 'That house is very appropriate for my daughter in terms of the living condition.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I can earn around 40000 per month.' The correct form should be 'I can earn around 40000 dollars per month.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'I think I am able to raise my daughter.' The correct form should be 'I think I will be able to raise my daughter.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So how’s your divorce case going? When will the court’s decisions be made? I mean do you roughly know the time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case going?' instead of 'So how's your divorce case going?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the part about whether there is a scheduled time for the court's decision to be made.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure about it. This week we have another court. I want express my idea to the court that I wish the court can be finished as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I want to express my idea to the court.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '希望判決能夠盡快出來' as 'I wish the court can be finished as soon as possible.' This does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text, which is a desire for the judgment to be delivered quickly.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Now let us do this. The court will arrange social workers to your children. And they will make evaluation about the relationship between you and your child. That will be the court’s reference to see who is better for the child. Before that I want to ask that will you consider the possibility of shared custody? The definition of shared custody is that the child stays with father for some time and stays with the mother for another time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Now let us do this' is incorrect. It should be 'Now let's do this.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '本院' as 'the court' instead of 'this court'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the social workers visiting both parties involved in the case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the court considering the social workers' report to make a decision.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the court determining the best arrangement for the child.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the possibility of shared custody being discussed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the definition of shared custody.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不喜歡這個提案，因為我女兒還太小，他只有八個月大。我不希望他在我和我太太之間搬來搬去。這個方式對這麼年幼的小孩來說太混淆了，怎麼可以讓她一下跟爸爸住一下跟媽媽住呢
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
Concerning this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small. She is not supposed to go through the process of shared custody.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter's age, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'is' instead of 'should' to convey the idea of obligation.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So we will have the social workers get to you first. After they finish the report, we will arrange the court date to give the opinion rights of both parties.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After they finish the report, we will arrange the court date.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social workers' in the sentence, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social workers' in the sentence, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social workers' in the sentence, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social workers' in the sentence, which is an important detail.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我對社工探視沒有意見
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '我對社工探視沒有意見' translates to 'I have no objection to social workers' visits,' which is different from the original text's meaning of 'Yes, I am fine with social workers' visits.'

沒有問題，謝謝。
I’m fine with it too, thanks.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'As I know' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '爭取子女撫養權' as 'custody of your child' instead of 'child custody rights'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'have' instead of 'has' in the question 'Plaintiff, why do you want to have the custody of your child?'
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user did not use appropriate honorific language or formal tone in addressing the plaintiff.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望得到孩子的扶養權因為下列的原因。首先，我的老婆不再陪著我們。我想要跟著我的女兒一起成長。此外，我知道我的老婆和別的男人現在正在一起。如果那是真的，我很懷疑我的老婆是否有辦法好好照顧我們的女兒。因此，我希望能爭取全部扶養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我希望得到孩子的扶養權因為下列的原因' (I hope to get custody of the child for the following reasons). The correct word order should be '因為下列的原因，我希望得到孩子的扶養權' (For the following reasons, I hope to get custody of the child).

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that you are in the case of divorce with your wife, and she doesn’t live with you now? And you think she lives with other man? Because of this concern, you don’t want to your child lives with her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
沒錯，那就是我所擔憂的。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Furthermore, it’s about your financial status. If you have the custody of your child, what’s your plan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
沒錯，我現在在台灣並沒有全職的工作。但是我有七份兼職工作，那使我的收入跟全職收入一樣多。我相信這樣的收入足夠負擔我和我女兒的生活費。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'regular income' as 'the same amount as a full-time income', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '七份兼職工作' (seven part-time jobs) before the verb '有' (have), which is incorrect in Chinese.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mention that you have many part time jobs. Because all of them are part time jobs, you think you may have how much fixed income every month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'how much fixed income do you think you may have every month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有四到五份兼職工作。平均來說，我一個月會有五萬元收入。有時候如果我額外接收到工作，我會有更多的收入。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
For the other question that I want to ask is that if you get the custody of your child, will you go to Canada and never come back again? I asked the question just because even if you have the custody, your wife may remain the visitation right. If you bring your child to your country, it may become a problem that you deliberately separate the child and your wife. For this point, what’s your point?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'If you bring your child to your country, it may become a problem that you deliberately separate the child and your wife.' The correct word order should be: 'If you bring your child to your country, it may become a problem that you deliberately separate the child from your wife.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '变相的隔离她们母女见面' is translated as 'deliberately separate the child and your wife,' which does not accurately convey the meaning of '隔离' (isolate/separate). The correct translation should be 'isolate them from seeing each other' or 'prevent them from meeting each other.'

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣生活了五年，我擁有居留證而且我喜愛這個地方，到目前為止我沒有離開台灣的任何打算，而且我的女兒有權利見到我和我太太。我必須強調的是，即使我和我太太正在進行離婚官司，但我並沒有想要切斷小孩和我太太的關係。在打官司的期間，我也有將我女兒的照片傳給我老婆。我甚至鼓勵他和我女兒見面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '而且我的女兒有權利見到我和我太太' should be '而且我的女兒有權利見到我和我太太'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So, you mean that you don’t have the plan to go back your country, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'So, you mean that you don’t have the plan to go back to your country, right?'

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
也不是這樣說，我也是有可能回去看我的母親，因為她已經很老了。就算我回去的話，我也不會在那邊待很久，我甚至考慮帶我女兒一起去的可能性。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that they are considering taking their daughter with them, while the original text explicitly states that they would not consider this possibility.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Ok. I want to ask the question of the other party. So, do you live with your husband now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
We live separately for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'have lived' instead of 'live'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file a divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you file for a divorce case?'

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Maybe two months before.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is necessary for clarity.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So, before you filed the case, you didn’t live with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
What’s you living status? I mean, you live with whom?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son who is from my first marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'son'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the question word '那' (which) and the verb '跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次' (how many times have you been married).

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'He is my second husband.'

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So, the custody that we concern about is between your second husband and you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
 How old is your son? And how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old. My daughter is eight months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you went out, your daughter lived with you or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'is she' instead of 'is'

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
 Because when I went out, my daughter was only 2 months, she needed me and she lived with me.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'lived' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'lived with me' instead of 'she lived with me'.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
 Now, the child lives with whom?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now, my daughter lives with my husband.
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'Now, my daughter lives with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you have any agreement? Why your daughter lived with you first, and now she lives with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '協議' as 'agreement' instead of 'arrangement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'lived' before the subject 'your daughter' in the second sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '原來' which means 'originally' in the first sentence.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
  The place that I live now is not big so my child lives with my husband. For environmental concern, my daughter lives with my husband now.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '比較小' as 'not big' instead of 'small'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'my child lives' instead of 'I gave my child to'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the husband's house being bigger.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the better environment for the child.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the decision being made by the speaker.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
Just for the objective circumstances, the situation for your daughter is not good, right? Why would you have the custody of your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my child, how could I live without her? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian, and he might go back to Canada any time. If that’s a case, I cannot meet my daughter anymore. So, I want to have the custody.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the child was carried for ten months before being born.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'is' instead of 'was' to indicate past tense in 'She is my child'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭取女兒的撫養權' as 'want to have the custody' instead of 'want to fight for custody of the daughter'.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your financial status, can you explain more that how would you rear your child?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'daughter' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'rear' before the subject 'you' instead of after.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are in divorce case now. I hope, after the case, I can live in the house that my husband lives now. The house is good for my daughter to grow up. For my financial status, I just turned in my asset list for the court. Furthermore, I have a job, and the income is NT40000 each month. I think I can be capable of rearing my child.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I hope, after the case, I can live in the house that my husband lives now.' The correct word order should be 'I hope I can live in the house that my husband lives in, after the case.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'The house is good for my daughter to grow up.' The correct form should be 'The house is good for my daughter to grow up in.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'For my financial status, I just turned in my asset list for the court.' The correct tense should be 'For my financial status, I have just turned in my asset list for the court.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after the introductory phrase 'For my financial status' in the sentence 'For my financial status I just turned in my asset list for the court.' The correct form should be 'For my financial status, I just turned in my asset list for the court.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How’s your divorce case now? When will the sentence out?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case going now?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of any scheduled judgment or approximate timing.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. This Friday, we will go to the court again. I want to tell the judge who charges our divorce case that I hope the sentence out fast.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok, so, the court will arrange the social workers to visit both parties. And the social workers will evaluate the situation. After the court sees the report, we will think who is better for the child. But before that, do both parties want to share the custody? The term of shared custody means that sometimes the child lives with father and sometimes lives with mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'But before that, do both parties want to share the custody?' is incorrect. It should be 'But before that, do both parties want to share custody?'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
 就目前來說，我並不想這麼打算，因為我的小孩還太小。她只有八個月大，我不希望她一直在我和我老婆之間來來回回。對於這麼小的小孩來說，對於她一下要來這邊一下要去那邊，會讓她感到困擾。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不希望她一直在我和我老婆之間來來回回。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '一下要來這邊一下要去那邊' is not an accurate translation of 'the changes between me and my wife'. It does not convey the idea of alternating between parents.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the child has to stay with one parent for some time and another parent for another period of time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '對於這麼小的小孩來說，對於她一下要來這邊一下要去那邊，會讓她感到困擾。'

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
For this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small, and it’s not suitable for shared custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'daughter'.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
We will arrange social workers’ visitation first. After they finish the report, we will set the next court date. Both parties will have chance to state, is that ok?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'We will first arrange social workers' visitation.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the social workers' visitation is part of the process before setting the court date.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After they finish the report, we will set the next court date.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that both parties will have the opportunity to state their opinions during the court proceedings.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
是的，我對於社工參訪沒有意見。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
Yes.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？

Please state more detailedly about this point. I know your case are also under the divorce judge, therefore, I want both of you to avoid the verbal attack situation.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I want to ask some question of the defendant. Would you please state why you want the custody of your child? As I know, you do not have a full-time job in Taiwan, and you are a foreigner, in the case of child rearing, why do think you are more better then the other?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望你能夠把女兒全部的撫養權都判給我。第一點是：我的妻子沒有和我住在一起了。我希望看著我的孩子成長。此外，我也聽說我的妻子現在正和其他男人住在一起。如果這是事實的話，那我會懷疑我的妻子是否能給我們的女兒最好的照顧。因此這就是我希望有全部撫養權的原因。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我希望你能夠把女兒全部的撫養權都判給我'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Incorrect translation of 'sole custody' as '全部的撫養權都判給我'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for wanting sole custody: 'because of two concerns'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'the best care she deserves'

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
 Do you mean you and your wife are having the divorce trial, and she does not live with you, and you also suspect that she is living with another man, so because of the two reasons you do not want to let your wife have the custody, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'you and your wife are having the divorce trial' instead of 'you are having the divorce trial with your wife'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'you do not want to let your wife have the custody' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The correct translation should be 'you do not want to give custody of your children to her'.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
沒錯，那是我主要的考量。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Besides, at the point of the financial status, if you have the sole custody of your daughter, what would you do?

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有全職的工作是個事實。但是我有幾份固定的收入，能夠幫助我們生活。我相信這幾份收入可以讓我和我女兒過生活。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在沒有全職的工作是個事實。' instead of '我現在沒有全職的工作是個事實。'

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned before that you have several part-time jobs, because those are part-time jobs, can you guarantee that you will have a fixed income?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of estimating the monthly fixed income.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平常有4～5份的兼職工作。總收入來說，它可以帶給我一萬五。如果我有其他的…額外工作的話，會帶我更多的收入。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'NT$50,000' as '一萬五', which means '15,000' instead of '50,000'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '的兼職工作' before the number '4～5份', which is the opposite of the original word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the unit 'NT$' when translating the amount of income.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
The next question is if you have your daughter’s custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and do not come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask is when you have the custody, but your wife also have the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, it will cut your daughter’s  ties with your wife. What’s your opinion about this point?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the father not returning to Taiwan.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'will' instead of 'would' to express a hypothetical situation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '隔離' as 'cut ties' instead of 'separate' or 'isolate'.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經待在台灣5年了。我有居留證，我也喜歡台灣。目前我並沒有離開台灣的打算，特別我認為，我的小孩有權…應該要有機會能夠看到父母。我想要強調的是，雖然我和我的妻子正打算離婚，但是我並沒有打算切斷他們母女的關係。就算我們在打離婚官司的期間，我也會定期寄照片給我的妻子。我甚至安排家庭聚會的時間，讓她和我們的女兒跟我一起見面，培養感情。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我認為，我的小孩有權…應該要有機會能夠看到父母'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '我想要強調的是，雖然我和我的妻子正打算離婚，但是我並沒有打算切斷他們母女的關係'

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'us' in the sentence: '我甚至安排家庭聚會的時間，讓她和我們的女兒跟我一起見面，培養感情'

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
Currently, you do not have the plan to go back, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不，我可能會回去，但這是因為我母親年事已高又已經生病了。但是即使我回去，我也不會待在那裏很久。更不會想要把女兒帶過去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '但這是因為我母親年事已高又已經生病了' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但這是因為我母親已經年事已高又生病了'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense in the sentence '但是即使我回去，我也不會待在那裏很久' is incorrect. The correct verb tense should be '但是即使我回去，我也不會在那裏待很久'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word '考慮' in the sentence '更不會想要把女兒帶過去'. The correct translation should be '更不會考慮想要把女兒帶過去'.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now, I am going to ask the other part some questions. Don’t you live with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'separated' should agree with the plural subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When do you …the case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
Before you have the divorce trial, you have already not live with your husband, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
Then, who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
 I live with my son which from my first marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I live' instead of 'I lives'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? Then, which is this marriage you with the plaintiff?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
Now，you are fighting the custody with your second husband and this child is a daughter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'fighting the custody' instead of 'fighting for custody'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'second husband' instead of 'second ex-husband' to accurately convey the relationship.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'Now' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'So'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the child being the biological child of the speaker and the second ex-husband.

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
Then how old is you son? And how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight-month …year old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	mismatch between singular subject 'daughter' and plural verb 'are'
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the word 'years' after 'eight-month'

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, does your daughter live with you or with your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'does' should be changed to 'did' to match the past tense of 'moved out'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because when I moved out, my daughter was just two- month old, she needed my care , so she was with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter was with the speaker.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
And now, who does your daughter live with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter live with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you have some agreements with your husband? Why does your daughter fist live with you, but with your husband later?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why does your daughter first live with you, but with your husband later?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The house I moved into is smaller than the house I lived with my husband. So take the environment into consideration, I think our previous house is better for my daughter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '對孩子比較優' as 'better for my daughter' instead of 'better for the children'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So, in the objective circumstance, which means the living environmental, if the house is the same as yours, you will live with your daughter, is that right? So why do you want to have the custody of your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I spend ten months bearing…to…, how could I live without her. And my husband is a Canadian, and he does not have regular income, he might have the possibility to go back to Canada any time. If that happens, I would not see my daughter anymore, that’s the reason why I wan to my daughter’s custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'I wan to my daughter’s custody'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'spend ten months bearing' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'live without her' in the translation

omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'that’s the reason why' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'I would not see my daughter anymore' in the translation

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Please describe detailedly about how will you raise your child, concider your financial status.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we are having the divorce case. I want to ask the court to sentence the house, which I lived with my husband before for me. So thinking about the environment, the house is a good place for my children to grow up. As for my financial status, I have already provided my own asset list to the court; otherwise, I also have a regular income, which is probably 40000(forty thousand) a month. I think I have the capability of taking good care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I want to ask the court to sentence the house'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'sentence' is not appropriate in this context. It should be 'grant' or 'award'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the house is currently occupied by the husband.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be 'are' to agree with the plural subject 'my children'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter is the subject of the sentence and should be mentioned earlier.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'lived' should be 'live' to match the present tense of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter is the subject of the sentence and should be mentioned earlier.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce trial? Do you know when do the divorce case end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce trial?' instead of 'How is your divorce trial?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the question about the timing of the judgment.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure, we will have the court on this Friday. I will say to the judge of our divorce case that I wan to end the case as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, the court will send social worker to visit both of your houses, and evaluate how is your daughter’s relation with each of you. The court will take those two factors into consider, and consider who will give the daughter the best …condition. Before we give the custody, do you have the willingness to have shared custody? The shared custody means the child live with the parent …live with the father for a while, and live with the mother for a while.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'The shared custody means the child live with the parent …live with the father for a while, and live with the mother for a while.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the social worker visiting both parties' houses and evaluating the child's relationship with each parent.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the court considering the social worker's report in making a decision.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the mention of the court making arrangements based on what is best for the child.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the question of whether both parties would consider shared custody.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
就我個人的意見的話，我不贊同共同撫養，因為我的女兒還太小，她只有八個月大。我不想她不能適應我跟妻子之間的變動。對一個這麼小的小孩來說，跟父親或母親只住在一起一段時間會造成她的混淆。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
In this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small, she is not …the shared custody is not good for her.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'she is' instead of 'she is not'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of why shared custody is not good for the daughter.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So, we just arrange the social worker first. After they have their reports, we will set another court date. At that time, both of you will have the chances to state your opinions.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After they have their reports, we will set another court date.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of arranging the social worker first before setting another court date.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我對社工探訪的這件事沒意見
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I do not have problems, thank you.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today I want to understand the stances of both parties for child rearing. And the other question I want to know is that why both parties think that he or she is best for the child rearing. And according to this question, I want you both can elaborate in detail. Because I know you are in the divorce case. And I don’t want you both make the verbal attack to each other.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
At first I want to ask the plaintiff. Why do you want to fight for the child rearing right? According to the file, you don’t have the regular job in Taiwan, and you are the foreigner. Why do you think are more appropriate for the child rearing right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's current job status and nationality.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我認為應該要將全部的撫養權判都給我,因為我真的非常關心他,我有兩個原因,第一是因為我的妻子根本沒有跟我們住在一起,我想跟我的女兒一起長大,而且我聽說我的前妻現在跟別的男人同居,如果事實真的是這樣的話,我很懷疑他是否能夠給我女兒一個很好的成長環境,因此我希望我能擁有全部的撫養權
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	撫養權判都給我 (grant all custody to me) should be translated as 應該要將全部的撫養權判給我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	我真的非常關心他 (I really care about him) should be translated as 我真的非常關心她 (I really care about her)
semantic conversion	omission of details	我有兩個原因 (I have two reasons) should be translated as 我有兩個原因 (I have two reasons)

semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	撫養權 (custody) should be translated as 撫養權 (custody)

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that your although you ex-wife is in divorce case with you but she live with another man. Moreover, you doubted that she is live with other man. Do you concern she’s situation, so you don’t the child rearing to granted to you wife?

Yes, those are my main concerns.
事的,這就是我所關心的
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '事的' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'concerns'.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
 According to you financial status, what will you going to do if you get the child rearing right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我知道我現在目前是沒有固定的收入,但是我有幾分兼職的工作可以讓我收入很穩定,我相信那些收入對我和我女兒來說是非常足夠的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mention that you have several part time job. Because they are part time job, can you promise you have the regular income?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均都有四到五份的兼職工作,平均來說我一個月都可以領四萬台幣左右,如果我有更好的工作阿或計畫的話我會有更多的收入
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
The other question I want to ask you is if you get the child rearing right, would you bring you daughter to Canada and would not come back Taiwan? I want to ask this question is even if you get the child rearing right, you wife still have the visitation right. If you bring you daughter to your country, on other hand to say that you are separated them. For this case, do you have any explanation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經住在台灣五年了,我有居留證,而且我也很喜歡這個地方,到目前為止我並沒有要離開台灣的打算,而且我想我的女兒有權力去見他的雙方父母,我必須強調的是,雖然我現在跟我的現任妻子正在打離婚官司,但是並不是說我要切斷他們所有的連繫,在我和我老婆打離婚官司這個期間,我還是有固定江我女兒照片發給我老婆看,我甚至鼓勵我老婆可以常常和我女兒就是可以出門走走希望增進感情

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean that you don’t have plan to back your country.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
也不是完全不可能,因為我的母親正在生病,不過就算我回去也不會待很久,因為我想要將我女兒……….
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of not considering the possibility of taking the daughter.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I want to ask the other party some questions. Do you separate with your husband now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we are separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'are' should agree with the plural subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
It’s to say before you file the divorce case, you both were not living together, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
And what’s your living circumstance? I mean who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son of first marriage.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So the marriage with the ………..
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the person the speaker is married to.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'he', so it should be 'He is' instead of 'He are'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the child rearing right today here you both fight for is your second husband’s daughter, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly refers to the child as the assistant's second husband's daughter, when it should be the assistant's daughter with her second husband.

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old are your son and your daughter?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'are' should agree with the plural subjects 'son' and 'daughter'.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son id 7 years old and my daughter is 8 months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter' in number.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you live outer, did your daughter live with you or your husband?

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because when I went out, my daughter still 2 months old, so she has to live with me.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is with my husband.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Did you have any agreement because your daughter is lived with you but now is live with your husband?

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
The objective circumstance, I mean the living environment does not change, does your daughter live with your husband is better than you. So why do you want to fight for the child rearing right?

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I have pregnant for ten moths, I can’t live without her. She is my baby. Moreover, I husband is Canadian, he is probably go back to Canada anytime, in that case, I can’t see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I want to right for my daughter’s custody.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
According to your financial status, can you explain what will you going to do to care with your daughter?

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we are in divorce case, I want to fight for the living right in currently my husband lived house. According to the environment that house is the vest choice for my daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce case? When is the decision comes out? Or the precise time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case?' instead of 'How is your case divorce?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the part asking about the expected time of the decision.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. This Friday we have to go to the court again. I want to state to the court that I want the decision comes out quickly.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok I will arrange the social workers to both parties’ house. And they will make the evaluation of the living situation of you both with your daughter. The court will make the decision concerning the social workers’ evaluation. But before that circumstance, I want ask you both, do you consider the shared custody. It means the living time will change from time to time with you both. Rather. It means the daughter will live with the husband some time and other time will live with the wife.

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence: 'But before that circumstance, I want ask you both...' It should be 'But before that, I want to ask both of you...'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
目前我並沒有這個打算,因為我覺得我女兒還太小了,她只有八個月大,我不想它異質精力這種在父母親之間的改變,對這麼小的小孩來說它是沒有辦法適應必須一下子跟這個至親在一起一下子跟那個親人在一起
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我并没有这个打算' instead of '目前我并没有这个打算'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '異質精力' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'changes between me and my wife'. It should be translated as '在父母之间的变化' instead.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the mention of the confusion it may cause for the child.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
Upon this point, I have the same idea with mu husband. My daughter is too young to suit the shared custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out critical context

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Ok, so at first I will arrange the social workers‘ visitation. After their report comes out, I will arrange the other court. And in this court, you both have the time to explain.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
So first I want to ask the plaintiff a few questions. Please tell me why do you want the sole custody of your children? As my un…for my understanding, you don’t have a… you don’t have a full time job or regular income I n Taiwan. Also, you are a fore…fore…foreigner. So, in this case, why you think you are more suitable for this… for the children…for the child rearing?

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望擁有我兩個女兒的全部扶養權，有兩個原因。首先，我太太已經不和我們一起住了。我希望能看著我女兒成長。恩…再者，我聽說我太太目前正在和別的男人同居。如果真的是這樣子的話，我很懷疑她是不是能夠讓我小孩擁有…得到應有的照顧。這就是為什麼我希望可以擁有全部扶養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我希望擁有我兩個女兒的全部扶養權' (I hope to have the sole custody of my two daughters). The correct word order should be '我希望擁有全部扶養權的我兩個女兒'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我女兒成長' (see my daughter grow up) is translated as '我希望能看著我女兒成長' (I hope to be able to see my daughter grow up), which changes the meaning slightly.

semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The phrase '我太太' (my wife) is translated as '我太太' (my wife), which is not culturally appropriate in English. The correct translation should be 'my wife'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean…um…even you and your wife are still in the case…in the divorce, that she’s no longer live with you? And you also doubt that she lives with the other…another man? So base on such situation, so you are not willing to give your child…your daughter to her. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'even you and your wife are still in the case…in the divorce'

semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the phrase 'to her' in the sentence 'So base on such situation, so you are not willing to give your child…your daughter'

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，就是這樣。這是我最主要的考量。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Otherwise, to consider your… in the consideration of your financial status, if you do have the sole custody, so how do you going to raise your child…your daughters?

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實是沒有全職的工作。但是我目前有幾份的打工，讓我有固定的收入。我相信這些收入足夠扶養我自己和我的女兒們。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在確實沒有全職的工作。'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. The correct verb form should be '沒有' instead of '是沒有'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '女兒們' is used in the translation, which means 'daughters', but the original text only mentions 'my daughter', indicating a singular form.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
So you just mention that you have several part-time jobs. So because they are part-times, can you give the basic…basic estivation… estitation that you can… how much money you can have each month?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有四到五份兼職。所以平均每個月可以有…一萬五的收入。如果有其他的工作的的話，會有更多的收入。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'NT$50,000' as '一萬五' is incorrect. It should be translated as '五萬台幣' to accurately represent the amount.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
So my another concern is that err if you have… if you have the custody, will you bring the daughters back to Canada and never come back? And why I ask this question is that even if you have the custody, your wife still might have the visitation right. So if you bring your daughters back to your country, then… in another way, it’s a kind way… it’s a kind of way of… cut the tie with your…cut the tie between your wife and daughters. So on this point, what’s your appoint…opinion?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omits the mention of 'daughters' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user uses 'will' instead of 'would' in the conditional sentence, resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待五年了，我有居留證，而且我喜歡這個地方，所以目前並沒有離開台灣的打算。尤其我覺得我的女兒有權利見到他的父親和母親。我想強調的是，雖然我和我太太正在打離婚官司，但我絕對並沒有想要把他們連結切斷的意思………並沒有把我太太和小孩的連結切斷的意思。即使在我們打官司的過程中，我還是會固定傳我女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至還安排了一些時間就是讓她…來和我們女兒一起團聚。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '尤其我覺得我的女兒有權利見到他的父親和母親' is incorrect. It should be '尤其我覺得我的女兒有權利見到她的父親和母親'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean you don’t…in recently… recently, you don’t have the plan to go back to your country, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
恩…並不是，因為我可能會回去加拿大。因為我母親已經老了，而且她還生病。但即使我回去加拿大，我也不會待非常久的時間。我甚至可能不會考慮帶我女兒一起回去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我甚至可能不會考慮帶我女兒一起回去' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我甚至可能不會考慮帶我女兒回去一起。'

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
OK now so I’m going to ask Ms…Ms. Shi few question. So you’re no longer lives with your husband, is that right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'lives' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'you no longer live' instead of 'you no longer lives'.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we are de…we are separated for six months.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
Um… can you… when you…when you… when you… right, when you ask for the divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Around two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So is that mean, long before you… before you file the case, you’re no longer live together?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So can you tell me your… now your live situation? I mean… who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I’m live with the… I’m live with my son from my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? So this is… this is which marriage do you have with our plaintiff?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He’s my second husband. He WAS my second husband.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'was' should be used instead of 'is' to indicate past tense.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So now the child rearing right we are arguing about is your… is with your second husband and your second daughters?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

對。
Yep.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughters?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughters?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is only eight month years old…eight-month old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'eight-month old' instead of 'eight month years old'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, um the daughter is with you or with the husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'is she' instead of 'is with you'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because when I moved out, my… our daughter is only two-month old so she is with me… she was with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the possessive pronoun 'our' before 'daughter', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the present tense 'is' instead of the past tense 'was' to match the past tense of 'moved out'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user changed the meaning of '孩子跟我' from 'the child is with me' to 'she was with me'.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So now where the… who now does the child live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
So far, the daughter live with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'My daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there some kind of agreement between you two? Why the… why the first the daughter live with you, and now she lives with your husband?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the phrase 'why the first the daughter live with you'.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I move out, the new house is a little bit smaller than the house we had. So our original house is… I think is better than the house I live for now, so I give the daughter to mu husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'So our original house is… I think is better than the house I live for now'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'I give the daughter to my husband' should be 'I entrusted our daughter to my husband' to accurately convey the meaning.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So if the objective circumstances, I mean the place you live, is nothing change, is there… is um… is not a very good place for your daughter, isn’t it? So why do you want to… why do you want the custody of your daughter?

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I mean com’n, she’s… she’s the daughter I bear for ten months, so how can I live with… no longer… errr no chance to see her after all…um after all this? And besides, my husband is a Canadian, and part…and the time… and he doesn’t have a regular part in Taiwan. Moreover, he… he might go back to Canada at any times! So in that case, if he went back… if he go back to Canada, is… I might no longer… I might no longer have the chance to see my daughters. So that’s why I want to argue for our… my daughter’s sole custody.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	com'n instead of how can I live with

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Base on your financial status, can you elaborate how you’re going to raise your daughter?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'financial' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'financial' and 'status' in the translation.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far, we’re still seeking the divorce case. So I to fight for the right to live with the house my husband is live with…is live in. So base on that environment, I think the house will be a… will be a right place… will be a good place for raising my child. And my… talking about my financial status, I’ve already offer the court one of my asset list. Otherwise, I have a regular job, so my total income each month is average forty thousands.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
May I ask your… your divorce case is in what progress? Is in what process? Is there any… any date that you are… you can expect that the judgment will… will come out?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. We have go to the court this Friday. I want ask the judge on Friday… um our judgment will come out as soon as possible.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, now, the court will arrange the social… a social worker to pay a visit to the plaintiff and the… to the husband and wife. And will make a evaluation about your… about your dealing…about your dealing situation between the father…between…um… between the parents and the children. And the court will make the judgment based on their evaluations and find out… find out what is the best situation for the children. Before that I have to ask, is shared-custody in your consideration?

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不喜歡這樣的安排，因為我女兒還太小了。她才八個月大欸。我不想要她在我和我太太之間不斷來回。對於這麼小的孩子來說，這未免也太混亂了吧，要和其中…其中…要和雙親其中一方待一陣子，然後有和另外一方待一陣子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	misplacement of words
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect interpretation of 'stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time'

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this point, I agree with my husband. My… our daughter is still too young for… is too young… for this solution.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'My... our daughter is still too young for... is too young... for this solution.'

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So in this case, so we might…err…so we are… so for now, we are going to into the procedure for the social worker’s evaluation. After evaluation came…come out, then we will arrange another court. Let the both side have the chance to their statements. Is that ok with you?

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today, in the preparation procedure, I would like to you… to know your position in the child rearing case and also I would like to know why you …both of you claim you are the appropriate person to rear the child.   Please elaborate this point. Besides, I know that you are also in the divorce case. So I don’t want to see verbal attack which you made on the other person.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I will inquire the plaintiff. Plaintiff, why do you want the custody to be granted to you? As I known, you don’t have a full time job in Taiwan, and also you are a foreigner. So why do you think you are …more capable?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我想要爭取小孩的監護權有個原因:第一我太太不再在跟我住，我想要看我小孩長大，而且我聽聞我太太跟一個男人同居，如果這是真的話，我懷疑她能給我女兒她應得的照顧，因此我希望擁有我女兒的扶養權
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我想要爭取小孩的監護權有個原因' should be '我有個原因想要爭取小孩的監護權'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that you.. and your wife are still in the divorce case but she no longer live with you and also doubted her of living with another man. Is this the reason that you refuse… refuse to give the daughter … be taking care of.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits important details from the original text.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對這是我主要的考慮
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
As for your financial status, if you are granted for the sole custody, how are you going to take care of her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How are you going to take care of her if you are granted sole custody?'

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有全職的工作是真的，但是我有幾份兼差，有穩定收入，我相信這幾筆收入能足夠讓我照顧我自己跟女兒
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of having a regular income from the part-time jobs.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have a few part jobs. Because that are just part-time jobs. Can you … can you approximately count what income could you have each month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有4到5個兼差，總共來說一個會有5萬多，有時候或許我有新案子，收入會更多
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another question I would like to ask, if you are granted with the custody of your daughter. Will you back to Canada and you won’t come back? The reason I am asking this question is …. Even though you are granted with the custody of your daughter, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to your country, it will …. It will cut the lie.. between the daughter and mom. As for this point, what do you have to say?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'It will cut the lie.. between the daughter and mom' is incorrect. It should be 'It will cut the tie between the daughter and mom.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'cut the lie' does not convey the intended meaning. It should be 'cut the tie' to indicate the potential disruption of the relationship between the daughter and her mother.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text, such as the mention of custody and visitation rights.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation lacks appropriate formality and politeness. It is important to use respectful language when discussing sensitive topics like custody and visitation rights.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年，我有居留證，我也喜歡台灣，目前我沒有計畫離開台灣，而且我相信我女兒應該要有機會看到爸爸媽媽，我想強調的是雖然我和我太太目前正在打離婚官司但我並沒有想要切斷女兒和媽媽的聯繫，在我們整個離婚官司的時候，我不時會傳些我女兒的照片給我太太，甚至還安排ㄧ些外出讓她能跟我們一起度過ㄧ些時光
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我女兒應該要有機會看到爸爸媽媽' is incorrect. It should be '我女兒應該要有機會看到爸爸和媽媽'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '打離婚官司' should agree with the subject '我和我太太', so it should be '我和我太太正在打離婚官司'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '待了五年' should be in the present perfect tense to match the English sentence, so it should be '我已經在台灣待了五年了'.
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	The phrase '我女兒' should have an article/determiner before it, so it should be '我的女兒'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我女兒應該要有機會看到爸爸媽媽' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents'. It should be '我女兒應該要有機會看到她的爸爸和媽媽'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user having an ARC (Alien Resident Certificate) in Taiwan.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean …. Recently you don’t have a plan to go back to your country, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不 我可能會回加拿大，因為我母親年紀大了又生病，但如果我回去的話，我也不會待很久，我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒回去
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "不 我可能會回加拿大" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我可能不會回加拿大".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense in the sentence "我也不會考慮帶我女兒回去" is incorrect. The correct verb tense should be "我也不會考慮帶我女兒回去".

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I am going to ask some questions of the other party. Do you …. You don’t live t with your husband, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes we have been separated for 6 months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Around 2 months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is necessary for clarity.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
You mean before file the divorce case, you had not live with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So can you tell me who you are living with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
 I am now living with my son which from the first marriage
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So what is the marriage you and the plaintiff?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the custody we are going to .. you are going to ask for is the child you had with your second husband? And she is a girl?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對。
yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? How old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is 7 years old and my daughter is 8 months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you move out, the daughter goes with you or stays with your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'goes' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'does the daughter go' instead of 'goes the daughter'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because when the time I move out, my daughter was only 2 months, she is so little and she needs me, so I brought he
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter is still in need of the user's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So who lives with the child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter lives with my husband
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you and the plaintiff have found an agreement? Why the daughter was with you but now she lives with your husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '中間有什麼協議嗎' as 'Do you and the plaintiff have found an agreement?' instead of 'What agreement do you have?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '原來女兒跟你，現在跟他' as 'Why the daughter was with you but now she lives with your husband.' instead of 'Why was the daughter with you before, but now she is with him?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
 The place I moved out was little.. Littler than the house my husband was living.. for the environmental concern I give my daughter to my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The place I moved out of was smaller than the house my husband was living in.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'little' should be 'smaller' to accurately convey the comparison between the two places.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the new place is smaller than the previous one.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation also omits the information that the new place is better for the child.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the reason for giving the child to the husband, which is the better environment.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstance did not change, your living environment is not good for your daughter, right? Why do you want to ask for the custody of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you want to ask for custody of your daughter?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. The original text does not mention anything about asking for custody, it only states that the living environment is not good for the daughter.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter who I spent ten months in pregnant. How could I bear not to see her? My husband is from husband Canada and his job in Taiwan is not stable. He may go back to Canada anytime, if that is the case, I could not see my daughter anymore, therefore I would like to as for the custody for my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'spent ten months in pregnant'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in 'husband Canada'
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect tense in 'he may go back to Canada anytime'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'I hope to' in 'I would like to as for the custody for my daughter'

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your financial status, could you tell how are you going to raise your child?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'explain' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'tell' before the subject 'you', which is incorrect in English.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are now still in the divorce case. I hope to ask for the hose which my husband lives now. So … as the surroundings around for the house, it will be good for my daughter. As for my financial status, I had already shown an asset list to the court. Besides, I also have a stable job; the payment which I could get every month is above 40000 Dollars. I think I am capable in both ways to raise my daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce going? Do know when the court’s decision will be made or …
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you know' instead of 'Do know'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the court in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the possibility of a scheduled judgment in the original text.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. This Friday we will be on the court again for the divorce case. I would tell the judge that I would like to know the court’s decision for the divorce as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok.. So.. The court will arrange social workers to visit both of your houses. And also the social workers will make the evaluation of the situation you and the plaintiff have with your child. The court will take the results into consideration and consider what is best for the child. Before that, I would like to ask both of you, do you like to have shared custody. The shared custody I mean here is the daughter will spend some time with the father and some time with the mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The court will take the results into consideration and consider what is best for the child.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the social workers visiting both houses in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the evaluation of the situation between the parents and the child in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court considering the social workers' report in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court making arrangements for the child based on the evaluation and report in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court asking if the parents would consider shared custody in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the explanation of shared custody, which is the child spending time with both parents in their translation.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不喜歡這個安排，因為我女兒還太小，她只有八個月，我不想要她一直在我和我太太間送來送去，對一個只有八個月的小孩來說，她可能會產生困惑，有些時間和爸爸在一起有些時間和媽媽
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不喜歡這個安排，因為我女兒還太小。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '送來送去' is not accurately translated. It should be translated as 'go back and forth' or 'shuttle between'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the changes between the parents. The original text mentions 'the changes between me and my wife'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about staying with one parent for some time and another parent for another period of time.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
At this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small. The arrangement should not .. could not be arranges as shared custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The arrangement should not be arranged as shared custody.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'also not suitable' from the original text.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So we will arrange the social worker to visit you houses. After they made the report, we will assign the next court day, so both of the parties will have the chance to state what you want to say. Is that ok?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the social worker visiting the houses.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the parties having the opportunity to state their opinions.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
社工人員來訪沒有問題
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I am fine with that, thank you.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today our case is the child rearing case between Ferry Johnson and Tsai-Yung Shu. Have you all… Have you both appointed lawyers?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我有委託律師。
Yes, I have.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有…一名律師。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'lawyer' in the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today for our preparatory case, my main goal today is to understand your main positions in the case. I would also like to know the reason why both of you believe you are more fitting to take care of the child. Could you please emphasize your views on this later on. Besides, I am also aware that you are in the court for divorce at the moment. So I would not like to hear any verbal attack between the two parties, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Could you please emphasize your views on this later on' is incorrect. It should be 'Could you please emphasize your views on this later?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence 'So I would not like to hear any verbal attack between the two parties, do you understand?'.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Ok, first I would like to ask: Why do you want… the right to take care of your child. As far as I know, you do not have an official job in Taipei. You are also a foreigner. Why do you believe you are a more suitable person for custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you want the right to take care of your child?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭取孩子的撫養權' as 'the right to take care of your child' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'custody'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the person not having a full-time job in Taiwan and being a foreigner, which are important details in the context of the question.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望擁有我女兒的全部扶養權，因為兩個原因。首先，我老婆並沒有汗我住在一起。我想要看著我的女兒長大。另外我還有聽到我的老婆漢另外一個男人同住。如果這屬實，我深切地懷疑她是否適合照顧我們的女兒，於是我希望取得全部扶養權。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	汗 instead of和
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the reason for doubting the wife's ability to care for the daughter

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
What you mean is…while your wife has filed a divorce case with you, she is not living with you at the moment. And you have doubts about whether she is living with another man. And therefore, you are not willing to let your wife take care of your children, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這是我主要的顧慮。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Next is about your financial status, and that means, if you receive custody of your child, how will you deal with the money?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我的確沒有一個全職的工作，但我有幾個兼職的工作，所以…我是有收入的。我認為這些收入是夠照顧我自己與女兒的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned you have many part time jobs. Because they are not fixed, can you estimate your fixed income for each month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Can you estimate your fixed income for each month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有四到五個…五份兼任的工作。加起來的話，大概會有一個月一萬五的收入。通常，如果我有新的專案的話，我就會有更多收入。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我平均有四到五個兼任的工作。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'NT$50,000' as '一個月一萬五' is incorrect. It should be translated as '五萬台幣'.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Next, I would like to ask you: If you received custody of your child, is it possible that you will bring your child to Canada, and never come back? My reason for asking this is even though you receive custody, your wife still has a visitation right. If you bring your child back to your country, it will equal…your preventing your wife from seeing the child. What do you have to say about this?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the possibility of not returning to the country after bringing the child to Canada.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了，我有居留證我也喜歡這個地方。至今我還沒有任核計劃要離開。尤其是我覺得…我女兒應該有見到她父母的權利。我想要強調的是：即使我和我老婆正在進行離婚程序，但我並不想要阻絕我老婆和我女兒…相見的機會。我們在辦離婚手續的這段期間，我都會固定送女兒的照片給老婆看。我也會計劃一些戶外的活動…讓女兒和老婆見面。

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omitting important details in the sentence: '我已經在台灣待了五年了' should be '我已經在台灣待了五年'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean in the short term, you have no plans to go back to your country.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不是，我可能會回到加拿大，因為我媽媽年紀大了，也生病了。但即便我回去，也不會待太久。我甚至完全不會考慮將我女兒一起帶回去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '不是，我可能會回到加拿大' is incorrect. It should be '我可能會回到加拿大，不是'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb '回去' should be consistent with the tense of the verb '回到'. It should be '回到' instead of '回去'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the mother being sick in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not considering taking the daughter with them in the translation.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
OK, now I’d like to ask the other party. So, you are not living with your husband anymore?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'So, are you not living with your husband anymore?'

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we’ve been separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the plural subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case for divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So you’ve been separated even before you filed a lawsuit for divorce.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So may I ask your living situation? What I mean is, who are you living with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I’m living with my son from my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? So, the marriage between you and the….defendant…which…
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '告訴人' as 'defendant' instead of 'informant'.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the custody that you both are seeking…. is for your second child, your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? And how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, did your daughter stay with the father or with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did your daughter stay with you or with the father?'

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out, the child was only six months old and needed me to take care of her, so she went with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the child was only 2 months old, not six months old.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
And who is the child with at this moment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'With whom is the child at this moment?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now the child is with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The correct word order should be 'Now my daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Have you reached any sort of agreement? Why was the daughter with you at the first point, and now with… the husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '中間有什麼協議' as 'reached any sort of agreement', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase 'the daughter with you at the first point'. It should be 'the daughter was with you at the first point'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '原來' which means 'originally' in the phrase 'Why was the daughter with you at the first point'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '女兒' which means 'daughter' in the phrase 'Why was the daughter with you at the first point'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '現在' which means 'now' in the phrase 'and now with… the husband'.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
My accommodation when I moved out is smaller than before. Considering the environment…the living environment, the old house was better, so I sent my daughter back.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So if the objective circumstances, or the living environment has changed, it’s not good for your daughter either, isn’t it? Then why would you want to fight for your child’s custody?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I bore her for ten months! How could I even consider leaving her? Besides, my husband is a Canadian citizen. He doesn’t even have a stable job. If so, I might never see my daughter again. So I wish to… to receive custody for my child.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of giving birth in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'receive' instead of 'fight for' in the translation.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Concerning your financial status, can you elaborate…more about how you will take care of your daughter?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about financial ability in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'Concerning your financial status' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'Can you elaborate'.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are still in the middle of our divorce case. I wish to receive the house that my husband is living in right now. That would be a better environment for my daughter to grow up in. And about my financial status, I provided the court with my asset list. I also have a fixed job. I earn 40 thousand dollars each month. Or more. I think I’m capable of taking care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'That would be a better environment for my daughter to grow up in.' It should be 'That would be a better environment for my daughter to grow up in.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I earn 40 thousand dollars each month.' It should be 'I earn 40 thousand dollars each month.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'I think I’m capable of taking care of my daughter.' It should be 'I think I am capable of taking care of my daughter.'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce case going? Have you estimated what time the courts decision will come out?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. We will come to court again this Friday. I wish to tell the judge of the divorce case that I would like to see the results of the divorce case come out sooner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
How about this, the court will send a social worker to visit both parties. Then they will evaluate the situation of both parties to see if they are fit to take care of the child. The report will be considered by the court to make the decision. But prior to that, I would like to ask if you consider…a shared custody? Shared custody entails that the child for a period of time stays with the father, and another period stays with the mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'How about this' is incorrect. It should be 'How about this?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'fit to take care of the child' is not an accurate translation of '針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估'. It should be 'evaluate the interaction between you and the child'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the social worker visiting both parties. This is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the court considering the social worker's report. This is a critical detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the question about shared custody, which is a significant part of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the explanation of shared custody being the child staying with the father for a period of time and with the mother for another period of time.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人比較不偏好這個選擇，因為我的女兒年紀還太小。她只有八個月大。不希望她承受…這樣子的變化。對一個年紀這麼小的孩子來說，她會感到太困惑了，如果她有一段時間與一個人同住，然後另一段時間又搬去另一個地方。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young. It is not suitable to…for shared custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
OK, after that, let’s consider the social worker…visit. After they have devised a report, we will plan a date to come to court to give both of you an opportunity to elaborate on your decisions.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'consider the visit of the social worker'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'of' after 'visit', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'to' after 'come', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'the' before 'court', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'the' before 'opportunity', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'to' before 'elaborate', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'your' before 'decisions', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好，沒問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no problem with the decision either, thank you.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today, we’re here for the preparatory procedure between Madam Shih Tsai Yun and Ferry Johnson. Have both of you asked for a lawyer?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

我有委託律師。
Yes, I have asked a lawyer to help me.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有請。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'lawyer' from the original text.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today, the judge here wants to know more about the perspective of each party about child rearing. The judge also wants to know why both of you consider yourselves the most appropriate one to rear this child, so please elaborate this point, do you understand? In addition, I know that both of you are trying to get a divorce. Therefore, I do not wish to see that both of you have a verbal attack against each other. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Today, the judge here wants to know more about the perspective of each party about child rearing' is incorrect. It should be 'Today, the judge here wants to know more about each party's perspective on child rearing.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The judge also wants to know why both of you consider yourselves the most appropriate one to rear this child, so please elaborate this point, do you understand?' is incorrect. It should be 'The judge also wants to know why both of you consider yourselves the most appropriate ones to rear this child, so please elaborate on this point, do you understand?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Therefore, I do not wish to see that both of you have a verbal attack against each other' is incorrect. It should be 'Therefore, I do not wish to see both of you have a verbal attack against each other.'

I understand.
好，是的。

了解。
Okay.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Okay now, I have some questions to ask the plaintiff. Please tell me the reasons why you wish to rear your child. According the information I’ve received, you do not have a full-time job in Taiwan, and you’re a foreigner, so why do you consider yourself the most appropriate person to have child custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Please tell me the reasons why you wish to rear your child.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭取孩子的撫養權' as 'have child custody' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the plaintiff not having a full-time job and being a foreigner, which is important context for understanding the question.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
現在有兩個原因去支持為什麼我比較適任於擁有子女撫養權。首先，我已經沒有和太太住在一起了，我想看著孩子長大。而且我還聽說我的太太和別的男人住在一起了。若是這樣的話，她應該不會給予我女兒真正應得的關愛。因此，我適任得到全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我適任得到全部的撫養權' should be '我適任全部的撫養權得到'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
So do you mean that now, you’re preparing for a divorce, and your wife is no longer living with you, and you suspect her of living with another guy. Due to the situation like this, you do not wish to let her take care of the child, is that so?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是啊，這就是我主要的原因。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Okay, then if…umm..according to your financial status, and if you really do receive the sole custody, then how are you planning to take care of the child?

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實沒有全職工作。但是，我好幾個間質的工作，因此，我有固定的收入。這些收入足以養活我自己和我的女兒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You’ve just mentioned about that you have several part-time jobs. Due to they are part-time jobs in their nature, can you tell me an estimated income per month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
平均來說，我有四到五份兼職工作。總共來說，我每個月會賺進五萬台幣。若我有找到其他工作的話，我的收入會高於五萬。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another question that I would like to ask you is once you receive the child custody, is it possible that you would just take the child to Canada and never come back? The reason why I asked you this is that even of you receive the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. So if you do this, if you just take the child to Canada with you, then it means that you just cut the ties between your daughter and your wife. So, according to this problem, what would you like to say?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the father taking the child to Canada and not returning.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待了五年了吧。我有居留證號碼，而且我喜歡這個地方。目前為止，我是沒有要離開台灣的打算。而且我有認為我女兒應該要擁有見雙方父母的權利。縱使我和我太太目前正辦理離婚，但是，我不打算要切斷她們之間的關係。在我們辦理離婚手續的過程當中，我常常會將我女兒的照片給我太太看。我甚至會辦一些活動啊，或是約。。。我們大家一起出去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我在台灣已經待了五年了吧'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in sentence: '我有居留證號碼'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in sentence: '我有認為我女兒應該要擁有見雙方父母的權利'
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in sentence: '我不打算要切斷她們之間的關係'
grammar and structure	preposition errors	Preposition error in sentence: '在我們辦理離婚手續的過程當中'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in sentence: '我甚至會辦一些活動啊，或是約。。。我們大家一起出去'

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
 Okay, so you mean that currently, you do not have any plans to return to your mother country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
恩，不不不，我是有可能回加拿大，因為我母親現在生病啦。但縱使我回去加拿大，我也不會長期待在那裡。我應該也不會想要把我女兒帶那裡。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我是有可能回加拿大'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我應該也不會想要把我女兒帶那裡'

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay, now, I would like to ask the other party some questions. Are you still living with your husband or not?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Well, we’re not living together anymore for six months.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense should be present perfect ('have been') instead of present continuous ('we're').

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you ask for a divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About a month ago, I think.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '兩個月前' as 'about a month ago' instead of 'about two months ago'.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
Okay, that means before you asked for a divorce, you two have not been living together, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes, that’s right.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So, who are you living with now? What’s the condition now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with the former husband’s son.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the relationship between the speaker and the son. Instead of saying 'I live with the former husband's son,' it should be 'I live with my stepson from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Oh, your former husband….first marriage? Then, how about the husband you have now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '第一任婚姻' as 'former husband' instead of 'first marriage'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question about the current husband.

他是我第二任先生。
Well, he’s my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '先生' as 'husband' instead of 'Mr.'

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
Now, we’re trying to figure out the custody is about the child you have with your second husband. She’s a daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'We're trying to figure out if the custody is about the child you have with your second husband. Is she a daughter?'

對。
Yes, that’s right.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
Then how old is your son, and how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
The time when you moved out, your daughter, who did she go with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
At that time, my daughter was only two months old; therefore, she needs my care, so she stayed with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they moved out.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'needs' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'needed'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter stayed with them.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
And now, who is she staying with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '在誰那裏' as 'is she staying with', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text '孩子在誰那裏'.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now, she’s staying with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Now, she’s staying with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Did you have any pact between each other? Why does your daughter stayed with you, and then, she’s staying with your husband now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'pact' does not accurately convey the meaning of '協議' which means 'agreement' or 'arrangement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the second sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Why is your daughter staying with your husband now, after staying with you?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place where I moved out to live is a bit small, and the place where my husband lives is quite large. Therefore, due to the environment and circumstances, I just wished my daughter to live with him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I just wished my daughter to live with him' instead of 'I just wished to live with my daughter with him.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
Okay, so if the objective circumstances do not change, then is your place still not better than your husband’s? Then why did you wish to receive the child’s sole custody?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
Hey, I am the one who bear her for ten months, I can’t live without her. Moreover, my husband is a Canadian, he does not have a fixed income, and he even has the possibility to return to Canada. If so, then I’ll lose the right to visit my daughter. Therefore, I’m here to gain for the custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I am the one who bear her for ten months' should be 'I am the one who bore her for ten months'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I can’t live without her' should be 'I can't live without her'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'he does not have a fixed income' should be 'he did not have a fixed income'.
grammar and structure	agreement errors in number or gender	Agreement error in the sentence 'I’m here to gain for the custody' should be 'I'm here to fight for custody'.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
In terms of your financial status, can you describe how you would raise the child?

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we’re still trying to divorce, and I would like to get the right of living in the place where my husband is now living. Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it would be perfect for my daughter to grow up. As for my current financial status, I have let the court see my asset list. Moreover, I have a very regular income and a very stable job. My monthly income would be no less than forty thousand. Therefore, I believe that I have the ability to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Now, we’re still trying to divorce' should be 'We're still trying to divorce now'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I would like to get the right of living' should be 'I would like to have the right to live'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it would be perfect for my daughter to grow up' should be 'Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it will be perfect for my daughter to grow up'.
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	Missing article in the sentence 'As for my current financial status, I have let the court see my asset list' should be 'As for my current financial status, I have let the court see my asset list'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence 'Moreover, I have a very regular income and a very stable job' should be 'Moreover, I have very regular income and a very stable job'.
grammar and structure	preposition errors	Preposition error in the sentence 'My monthly income would be no less than forty thousand' should be 'My monthly income would be no less than forty thousand dollars'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the word 'dollars' in the sentence 'My monthly income would be no less than forty thousand'.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of the word 'very' in the sentence 'Moreover, I have a very regular income and a very stable job'.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in the sentence 'Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it would be perfect for my daughter to grow up' should be 'Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it would be a great place for my daughter to grow up'.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
Okay, so how is your divorce case going on? Do you know why you will get the verdict, approximately when?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
Well, I’m not sure. We’ll go to the court this Friday again. I would like to ask the court to make a decision of the verdict sooner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
 The court will ask social workers to visit the home of both parties and make an evaluation of each of your ways of taking care of the child. And the court will decide according their report of how you take care of the child. Before this, I would like to ask both parties do you mind of having a shared custody? Shared custody means that the child can stay with her father for a while, and stay with her mother for another while
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Before this, I would like to ask both parties do you mind of having a shared custody?' is incorrect. It should be 'Before this, I would like to ask both parties if you would consider having shared custody?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'do you mind of having a shared custody' does not accurately convey the meaning of '共同持有撫養權' (shared custody).

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
恩，我不太想要耶，因為我女兒還小。她才八個月大。我不想要她一下子陪我，然後一下子又陪我太太。如果是這樣的狀況的話，我的女兒她這麼小，她會覺得很混亂。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree with my husband’s point. My daughter is too young; therefore, shared custody is not the right choice for us.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay, if so, then we’ll just begin our progress of sending the social workers. And after receiving their report, we’ll set up a time to open the court again. Therefore, you two will have the chance of making a statement, okay?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of arranging a social worker visit.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of giving both parties an opportunity to express their opinions.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
恩，好的，社工人員可以來我家。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no problem with that, either, thank you.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, the plaintiff, please, why do you want to have the right to rear your child? As the court investigates, you don’t have a formal job in Taiwan. You haven’t had a formal job in Taiwan yet. Beside, you are a foreigner. Why do you think that you have the capacity to take care of your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'As the court investigates, you don’t have a formal job in Taiwan.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Inconsistent use of tenses in the sentence 'You haven’t had a formal job in Taiwan yet.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Misinterpretation of 'capacity' as 'capacity to take care of your child' instead of 'suitability' or 'qualification'.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	Misinterpretation of 'foreigner' as '外國人' instead of '外籍人士'.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望法院可以判給我全部撫養權，因為兩個原因。首先，我妻子不再跟我一起生活了。我想在這邊看我女兒長大。此外，我還聽說我妻子還跟另外一個男人共處。如果那是真的的話，我就懷疑她是否能撫養我們的女兒。所以我想要有全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我希望法院可以判給我全部撫養權' (I hope the court can grant me full custody). The correct word order should be '我希望法院可以判給我全部撫養權'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我想在這邊看我女兒長大' (I want to be there to see my daughter grow up). The correct verb form should be '我想在這邊看著我女兒長大'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence '我還聽說我妻子還跟另外一個男人共處' (Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man). The word '共處' (living together) does not accurately convey the meaning of 'living with' in this context. It should be translated as '和另外一個男人住在一起' (living together with another man).
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the phrase 'the best care she deserves' in the sentence '我就懷疑她是否能撫養我們的女兒' (I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves). The phrase 'the best care she deserves' is not included in the translation.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of the word '全部' (full) in the sentence '我想要有全部的撫養權' (Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody). The word '全部' is not necessary and changes the meaning of the sentence. It should be translated as '我想要有獨自撫養的權利' (I hope to have the right to sole custody).

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that your wife is not under the same roof with you, and you are dealing with the case about divorce. Besides, you are also suspicious about whether she stays with a other man. Is this the very reason for you to have the sole custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Is this the reason for you to have sole custody?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧' as 'have the sole custody' is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as 'not willing to entrust the children to her care'.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是，這是我的主要原因。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
About your financial status, if you get the sole custody of your daughter, how do you rear your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How do you plan to rear your daughter?'

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有全職的工作。但是我有許多兼職的工作，讓我有固定的收入。我覺得這些收入已經足夠養活我和我的女兒了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在沒有全職的工作。' instead of '現在我沒有全職的工作。'

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have some part-time job. Because these jobs are not formal, do you have the whole overview of your regular income? Whether it is fixed?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有4到5個兼職工作。大約可以讓我賺5萬塊吧。如果我有其他案子的話，收入會更多。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Besides, the court would like to ask another question. Do you plan to bring her back to Canada and do not return to Taiwan after you have the sole custody? The reason for asking this question is that your wife may still have the visitation right after you have the sole custody. If you bring your daughter back to your country, it may evolve into a situation that you cut the tie between your wife and your daughter. About this point, what do you want to say?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important information from the original text.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待了5年了。我己經有了居留證號碼，也喜歡這個地方。我沒有任何離開台灣的打算。我認為，其實女兒有可以看我們雙親的權利。我想要強調一點，雖然我們現在打離婚官司，但我沒有要切斷他們兩個聯繫的意圖。在我們打離婚官司的時候，我還寄了不少我女兒的照片給老婆呢。我甚至安排時間能讓我和女兒、還有我的太太一起出遊呢。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我己經有了居留證號碼' should be '我已經有了居留證號碼'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in sentence: '我沒有任何離開台灣的打算' should be '我沒有任何離開台灣的計劃'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in sentence: '我認為，其實女兒有可以看我們雙親的權利' should be '我認為，女兒應該有權利看到她的雙親'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of details in sentence: '我想要強調一點' should be '我想要強調的是'.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of unnecessary content in sentence: '在我們打離婚官司的時候' should be '在我們離婚的期間'.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in sentence: '我還寄了不少我女兒的照片給老婆呢' should be '我還定期給我妻子寄送我們女兒的照片'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean that recently, you don’t have the plan to return to your country.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
其實我也可能會回加拿大，因為我媽媽很老、很虛弱。如果我回國，也不會待太久，甚至不考慮把我女兒一起拜去加拿大。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation includes unnecessary cultural details that are not present in the original text.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay, now I’m going to ask the other party. Is that true that you don’t live with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been separated for about 6 months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case about your divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About 2 months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is necessary for clarity.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That is to say, before you file the divorce case, you two have not lived together. Is that true?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So, how is your living situation? I mean that who accompanies you, live with you.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son with my first marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I live' instead of 'I lives'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? What is the time of marriage with the plaintiff?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
Therefore, you are seeking to the custody of your daughter, who you have with the second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'seeking to the custody' instead of 'seeking custody'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'you have' instead of 'you had' to match the past tense of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the second husband in their translation.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son with your first marriage?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is 7 years old, and my daughter is about 8 months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
After you move away from your house, you bring your daughter with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because at that time, my daughter was only 2 months, she still needed my support.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the child is with the speaker.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Now, where is your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation changed the word '孩子' (child) to 'your daughter', which is a specific reference and may not accurately convey the original meaning.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
My daughter is living with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you two have any agreements with each other because firstly, she lives with you, and now she lives with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The house I’m living after moving out is smaller than the one that I stayed with my husband. In terms of the environment, I think it is better to stay in the original house with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The house I’m living in after moving out is smaller than the one that I stayed in with my husband.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the environment is better for the child in the new house, but the user's translation suggests that the environment is better in the original house with the husband.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstance about your house is not better than your husband’s house, it is not good for your daughter, isn’t it? Why do you want to have the right to rear your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I had been pregnant about 10 months for the daughter. How can I just give my daughter to my husband? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian. He don’t have regular jobs and formal jobs, I’m afraid that he will go back to Canada. If that is true, I will not see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I would like to strike to have the right to rear my daughter.
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect use of past perfect tense

omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the mention of the possibility of the husband returning to Canada
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the mention of the desire to fight for custody

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your financial status, please elaborate how you will take care of your daughter in the future.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of financial ability or capability to support the daughter.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are still dealing with the case of our divorce. Now, I’m seeking to win, to have the right to live in the original house, which now my husband is living. Therefore, in terms of the living conditions and environment, the original house is better for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have provided a asset list for my income. Besides, I have a formal job in Taiwan, and the regular payment is 40,000 NT dollars. I think that I have the capacity to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Now, I’m seeking to win, to have the right to live in the original house' is incorrect. It should be 'Now, I’m seeking to have the right to live in the original house and win the case of our divorce.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'which now my husband is living' should be 'which is currently being lived in by my husband' to accurately convey the meaning.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The phrase 'the regular payment is 40,000 NT dollars' should be 'I receive a regular payment of 40,000 NT dollars.' The verb tense is incorrect.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of providing an asset list for the court.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of having a formal job in Taiwan.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce case now? Do you have the idea about the exact time to close your divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case going now?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of any scheduled judgment or approximate time for the judgment.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. This Friday, we will attend the court about my marriage. I hope that I will ask the court to have their decision faster and earlier.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'divorce case' as 'marriage'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of attending court again.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of expressing the desire for a quick judgment.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, the court will arrange social workers to visit you two, and these social workers will evaluate in terms of the circumstances about rearing your daughter. We will make further decision in terms of their observation. However, before that, can have shared custody? Shared custody is that your daughter will stay with your husband a whole and later will spend some time with the mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Can have shared custody?' is incorrect. It should be 'Can we have shared custody?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '共同撫養' as 'shared custody' is not accurate. It should be translated as 'joint custody' or 'shared parenting'.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人認為，我不太想要共同扶養權，我女兒還很小，只有8個月大，我不希望她在我跟太太之間送來送去的。對一個只有8個月的小孩來說，一下子跟我住，一下子又跟她媽媽住的話，會讓她十分困擾。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by using the term '共同扶養權' (joint custody) instead of 'changes between me and my wife'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error by placing the verb '送來送去' (send back and forth) before the subject '她' (she).

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
About this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is still too young. It is not appropriate for her to live with the shared custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I agree with my husband about this point.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '共同撫養的安排方式' as 'shared custody', but the correct translation should be 'co-parenting arrangement'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for not agreeing with the shared custody arrangement, which is that the daughter is too young.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Therefore, the court will first arrange social workers to visit with you two parties. After their report and observation, we will further set a court day. Therefore, on that day, you can elaborate further about this case.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Therefore, we will first arrange social workers to visit with you two parties.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social workers' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'report and observation' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'further set a court day' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'elaborate further about this case' in the original text.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好的，我可以接受社工人員的拜訪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
Yes, I’m okay as well for this arranging.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, I am going to know the position of both of you. I also want to know why both of you think that you can have the sole custody. Please elaborate for this point. Besides, you two are under the divorce procedure. Therefore, please do not have verbal attack with each other. Is this okay?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'I am going to know the position of both of you' is incorrect. It should be 'I am going to know both of your positions.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'think' should agree with the subject 'both of you', so it should be 'both of you think that you can have sole custody.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'are' should be in the present continuous tense to match the ongoing divorce case, so it should be 'you two are undergoing the divorce procedure.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of wanting to understand the position on child custody specifically.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Plantiff, why do you strive for the child’s sole custody? As far as I am concerned, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan. You are a foreigner. Why do you think that you have the right to have the child’s sole custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think that you are more suitable?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '適任' as 'have the right' is incorrect. It should be 'more suitable'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the plaintiff not having a full-time job and being a foreigner, which are important details in the context.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
因為以下兩點，所以我想爭取孩子的獨立撫養權第一，我的妻子沒跟我同住，我想看我女兒長大，更何況我聽說我妻子跟另外一個男人住，如果這是真的，我很懷疑她是否能給我們女兒最好的照顧，因此能擁有獨立的撫養權
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that your wife has no longer lived with you, even if you two are still under the divorce procedure? Moreover, you also suspend she is now living with another man? It is because this situation therefore you do not want to give her the custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'suspend' does not match the intended meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the children in the translation.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這是我的主要考量

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
How do you plan to take care of your daughter according to your financial status?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我目前的確沒有全職工作，但我有好幾份兼職，也有穩定的收入，我想這收入足夠我養活我的女兒和自己
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '想' (want) should come before the subject '我' (I).

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because what you did is still the part-time jobs, can you evaluate how much do you earn per month regularly?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
 我平均來說有四五份兼職，總計大概有五萬台幣，有時如果找到新的兼職，我可能還會有額外的收入

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I want to ask that if you get your daughter’s sole custody, will you go back to Canada and never come back to Taiwan again? The reason why I ask this question is that if you get the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, the situation will be that you separate your daughter with her mom. As for this, what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter's custody in the translation.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了，也有了居留證，而我也很喜歡這裡，目前為止我沒有打算離開台灣，另外，我也覺得我女兒有權利見到父母雙方，我想要強調，儘管我跟我太太正在打離婚官司，但我並不想切斷我女兒的聯繫，在我們打離婚官司的過程中，我也好幾次發我女兒的照片給我太太，我甚至邀請她和我女兒一起出遊

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean that you do not plan to go back to your hometown?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
是的，但我可能會回加拿大，因為我母親年老且生病了，但就算我回去，我也不會待太長時間，我甚至不考慮帶我女兒一起去
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我甚至不考慮帶我女兒一起去" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我甚至不考慮帶我女兒去一起".

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay, then I will ask the other side some questions. Now you do not live with your husband, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we live in different places for six months.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case for divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Maybe two months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is necessary for clarity.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That is to say, before you two seek for divorce, you did not live your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
Then who do you live now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
 I live with my son in my first marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I live' instead of 'I lives'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? How about the plantiff?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the plaintiff's marriage.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So you are now striving for the custody of your daughter with the second husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'striving' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'are striving' instead of 'is striving'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'striving for the custody', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '爭的子女撫養權' which means 'fighting for child custody'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the second husband in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the child being a daughter in the translation.

對。
 Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'How old are your son and daughter?'

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is 7 years old and my daughter is 8 months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, who did your daughter live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
My daughter was with because she was only two months old then.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for the daughter being with the speaker, which is that she needed the speaker's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Who is your daughter living with now?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is living with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Now my daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you two have an agreement? Why the daughter first with you and now with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place where I live now is much smaller than the house I lived with my husband before. Considering the environment, my husband’s house is better for my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The place where I live now is much smaller than the house I lived in with my husband before.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '對孩子比較優' as 'my husband’s house is better for my daughter,' which is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as 'better for the child.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
Therefore, in objective circumstances, your place is not good for your daughter, right? Then why do you want the custody of your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by changing the meaning of the sentence.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is the one who I spent ten months to have, how can I live without her? My husband is a Canadian. Besides, his job is not stable. He might go back to Canada anytime. In that case, I cannot see my daughter again. So I want to have my daughter’s sole custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'She is the one who I spent ten months to have'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'My husband is a Canadian'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'He might go back to Canada anytime'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the detail that the speaker gave birth to the daughter
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of unnecessary content in the sentence: 'how can I live without her?'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the detail that the speaker wants to fight for custody of the daughter

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
In the terms of your financial status, can you explain how you are going to rear your daughter?

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are still under the divorce case. I wish the court can let me in my husband’s house. Therefore, as to the environment, that house will be good for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have given the court my current asset list. Besides, I have a regular job and on average, I have NT$40000 per month. Therefore, I am able to take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'I wish the court can let me in my husband’s house'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'let me in my husband’s house' should be translated as 'let me live in my husband’s house' to convey the intended meaning.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
I would like to ask that how’s your divorce case? When will the trial procedure be set?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How is your divorce case?' instead of 'How's your divorce case?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the part about asking for the trial procedure to be set.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation does not provide any context or background information about the divorce case.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure about that. We have a court this Friday. I hope to ask the judge of my divorce case to have the result quickly.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
The court will send social workers to you and your husband’s houses, then evaluate the situation. The court will make the decision according to the social workers’ report. Before that, I want to ask that will you consider the shared custody? The shared custody is that your daughter will respectively live with mom and dad in a certain period.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The court will send social workers to you and your husband’s houses, then evaluate the situation.' is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'The court will send social workers to your and your husband’s houses, then evaluate the situation.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence 'The court will make the decision according to the social workers’ report.' The correct verb form should be 'makes' to agree with the singular subject 'court'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'husband' should be replaced with 'father' in the sentence 'Before that, I want to ask that will you consider the shared custody? The shared custody is that your daughter will respectively live with mom and dad in a certain period.'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人認為這並不適合，因為我女兒還太小，她只有八個月大，我不想她在我和老婆間換來換去，這對我小孩來說，這會造成我小孩的混亂，當他一下跟爸爸，一下跟媽媽的時候
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
At this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young to have the shared custody about rearing together.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay, then we will first arrange for the social workers’ visit. After getting the report from the social workers, we will set the court date. Both of you have the right to state your opinions.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After getting the report from the social workers, we will first arrange for the social workers' visit.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我對於社工的探訪沒有問題
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
 I also have no questions, thanks.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation is missing the important detail of the subject of the sentence.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'lawyer' from the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today the judge will want to know your positions of the child rearing. We also want to know why you think you are suitable for rearing this child. Please elaborate it according to this point. I know you are also in the divorce case. So we hope that you could avoid the verbal attack.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Today the judge will want to know your positions of the child rearing' is incorrect. It should be 'Today the judge will want to know your positions on child rearing.'

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I would like to ask some questions for both of you. The plaintiff, why do you want to strive for the child rearing rights? As I know, you do not have full-time job in Taiwan. And your identity is foreigner. For this situation, why do you think you are more suitable?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the defendant's reasons for wanting to strive for child rearing rights.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the question for the plaintiff at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the statement about the defendant.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'child rearing rights' as '子女撫養權' which is a direct translation but not commonly used in Chinese. The more appropriate term would be '監護權' or '撫養權'.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
考量這2個原因，我希望能將全部撫養權判給我。第一，我的妻子沒有跟我一起住了。我想要看到我小孩長大。此外，我也聽說我的太太現在跟另外一個男人一起住。如果是這樣的話，我很懷疑他能給小孩一個好的成長環境嗎？所以我希望我能擁有全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '考量這2個原因' should be '考量這兩個原因'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '撫養權判給我' should be translated as 'grant me custody' instead of '判給我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the reason for wanting sole custody, which is the wife living with another man.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
So you mean that your wife is in the divorce case with you, but she does not live with you now? And you doubt that she lives with other man. It is this situation that makes you unwilling to make your children taken care of by her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這就是我主要的考量緣故
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
For your financial status concerns, if you get sole custody, how will you raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
的確，我現在沒有全職工作，但是我現在有兼好幾份打工，足以付足…。我想這些收入足夠撫養我的女兒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '足以' should come before the noun '撫養'.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because they are all part-time jobs, could you evaluate how much regular income you will get?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Could you evaluate how much regular income you will get?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我大概有4到5份的兼職工作。那這樣算起來的話，每個月我大概可以有5萬元的收入，此外我如果還有多一些工作的話，也許收入會增加。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I have another question. If you have the custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and will not come back to Taiwan? I ask this is because that even if you get the custody, your wife still has the visitation rights. If you take your child back to your country, it means that you cut the tie between the mother and the daughter. What’s your idea about this?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's visitation rights in their translation.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待5年了，我有居留證號碼，而且我非常喜歡這個地方。目前為止，我沒有要離開台灣的打算。我也覺得我的小孩有需要見到父母。我要強調，雖然我跟我太太現在在打離婚官司，但我從來沒想過要切斷他與我女兒的聯繫。在打離婚官司的過程中，我有寄我女兒的照片給我太太，我還邀請…
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也覺得我的小孩有需要見到父母' is incorrect. It should be '我也覺得我的小孩有需要見到父母'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean in the short term, you do not plan to go back to your country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
也許吧。因為我母親已經非常老而且生病了。即使我回去了，我也不會留太久。我也沒想過我要把女兒一起帶回去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "也許吧" is incorrect. It should be "吧也許".
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of "may" as "也許" is incorrect. It should be translated as "可能".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase "No, I" at the beginning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase "even if" in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase "I wouldn't stay long" in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase "I won't even consider the possibility of" in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase "taking my daughter with me" in the sentence.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now we want to ask the relative party about some questions. You do not live with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have not lived together for six months.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
So when do you suit the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So before you suit the divorce case, you do not live together?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So who do you live with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son with my first marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I live' instead of 'I lives'.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So what’s the…
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So about the child rearing rights, it’s about the daughter with your second husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'child rearing rights' instead of 'child custody'.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? And your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is six months old.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '8 months old' as 'six months old'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you move out, does your daughter live with you or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'is your daughter' instead of 'are your daughter'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I move out, my daughter was only two months old, and she needs me, so she lived with me then.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'move' should be in the past tense 'moved' to match the past tense of 'was' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the daughter still needs the user's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So where did the daughter live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter lives with my husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation changes the meaning of the original text.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between your husband and you? Why does your daughter live with your husband instead of you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '你們中間有什麼協議嗎' as 'Is there any agreement between your husband and you?' instead of 'Do you have any agreement between you?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '原來女兒跟你，現在跟他' as 'Why does your daughter live with your husband instead of you?' instead of 'Why did your daughter used to live with you, but now lives with him?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I move out, the place I live is smaller than the place that my husband lives. For living environment, it will be better for my child, so I let my daughter live with my husband.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So if the objective circumstances, that is, the living environment, does not change, it’s still not good for your daughter, isn’t it? So why do you strive for the custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'So why do you strive for custody?'

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter, and I cannot see her. My husband is a Canadian, and his job in Taiwan is not so fixed, he may go back to Canada anytime. Then, in that case, I will not see my daughter forever. So I hope I can strive for the rearing rights for my daughter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was pregnant for ten months before giving birth to the daughter.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'cannot' instead of 'can't' to match the subject 'I'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband is a Canadian citizen.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband's job in Taiwan is not stable.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker wants to fight for custody of the daughter.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your financial status, how will you afford the raising…?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we are still in the divorce case. I hope I can strive for the rights that I can live in the house that my husband lives now. So for the living environment, that house will be good for my daughter. As for my financial status, I have offered my asset list for the court. Besides, I have the fixed job, that I can get NT$40000 per month. I believe I can raise and take care of my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'So for the living environment, that house will be good for my daughter.' The correct word order should be: 'So, that house will be good for my daughter for the living environment.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'I believe I can raise and take care of my daughter.' The correct form should be: 'I believe I can raise and take care of my daughter.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'strive for the rights' does not accurately convey the meaning of '爭取到' in the original text. It should be translated as 'fight for' or 'seek' instead of 'strive for'.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So how is your divorce case? When will the divorce case have the result?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of any specific details about the divorce case.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not so sure. We will be in court this Friday. I will express to the judge of the divorce case that the decision can be given as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
So the court will send the social workers to visit both of you, and will make the evaluation for how you interact with your daughter. We will make some decision according to the social workers’ report. Before that, I would like to ask will both of you consider the shared custody? Shared custody means that the daughter will live with the husband sometime and live with mother some time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'We will make some decision according to the social workers’ report' is incorrect. It should be 'We will make a decision according to the social workers’ report.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement in the sentence 'Before that, I would like to ask will both of you consider the shared custody?' is incorrect. It should be 'Before that, I would like to ask, will both of you consider shared custody?'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'the daughter' in the sentence 'Shared custody means that the daughter will live with the husband sometime and live with mother some time.' It should be 'Shared custody means that the daughter will live with the husband sometime and live with the mother some time.'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我並不太贊成這個安排，因為我的女兒還太小，他只有8個月大，我不想讓他在我跟我太太之間傳來傳去的。對一個這麼小的小孩來說，如果讓他跟爸爸住一段時間，又讓他跟媽媽住一段時間，這樣會讓他感到非常混亂。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small, it is not suitable for this arrangement.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I agree with my husband.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of '共同撫養的安排方式' (arrangement of co-parenting).

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Ok, we will go through the process of social workers’ visitation. After they do the report, we will set the next court date. Then we will make both of you have the opportunity to state.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Then we will set the next court date.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'social workers' in their translation, which is an important detail from the original text.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'state their opinions' in their translation, which is an important detail from the original text.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好，我同意這個安排。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I also agree, too.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today my major concern is to clarify your will on child custody. I also concerned with why both of you consider yourself fully capable for the sole custody. Please elaborate your view. Beside the child rearing case, I know you’re also up with a divorce case. So I hope there won’t be any verbal attacks in the court.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Please elaborate your view' is incorrect. It should be 'Please elaborate on your view'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the other party's will on child custody. The original text states 'I also concerned with why both of you consider yourself fully capable for the sole custody.'

I understand.
我瞭解了

I understand

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Let me ask you a few question. Plaintiff, why do you want to get the sole custody of your child? Far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan for the time being. And you’re also a foreigner. In fighting for the child rearing right, why do you think you’re more capable?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you think you're more capable in fighting for the child rearing right?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'sole custody' as 'child rearing right' is incorrect. 'Sole custody' refers to having full legal and physical custody of the child, while 'child rearing right' is a broader term that encompasses various aspects of raising a child.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the plaintiff not having a full-time job in Taiwan, which is relevant to the question of why they believe they are more capable.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The translation lacks the appropriate level of formality and politeness expected in a court setting.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望能得到我女兒的全部撫養權, 而我有兩個理由. 首先我太太已經沒和我們住在一起了, 我希望能陪伴我女兒成長. 再來我聽說我老婆和另一個男的同居了, 如果這事情是真的, 那我懷疑她可以帶給我們女幸福, 因此我希望能有全部撫養權
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我女兒的全部撫養權' should be '全部撫養權的我女兒'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我女兒的全部撫養權' is translated as 'the sole custody of my daughter' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'sole custody'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the reason for wanting sole custody, which is the wife living with another man and the doubt about her ability to provide the best care for the daughter.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean because your wife is still up with a divorce case with you, but she no longer live with you, is that right? Moreover, you think she’s living with another man. Regarding this situation that’s why you don’t want to share custody with your wife, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'is still up with a divorce case with you'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'she no longer live with you' should be 'she no longer lives with you'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'you think she’s living with another man' should be 'you suspect she’s living with another man'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'Regarding this situation that’s why you don’t want to share custody with your wife' should be 'That's why you don’t want to share custody with your wife'

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對, 這都是我的考量

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Other than that, concerning your financial status, how are you going to raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
確實我現在沒有一份全職的工作, 但是我有兼任好幾份工作並提供我穩定的工作, 我相信我的收入能夠提供我和我女兒足夠的金額
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned you have several part-time jobs, since all of them are part-time jobs, can you make an evaluation about how much exactly you make each month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'can you make an evaluation about how much exactly you make each month?'

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
平均來說我大概有四五份兼職工作, 全部加起來的話一個月大概能賺五萬塊有時如果有接到新案子的話可以賺更多錢
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
And another question, after you get the sole custody of your child, will you take her to Canada and do not return? The reason why I’m asking this question that even if you get the sole custody, your wife still have the visitation right. So if you take your daughter back to Canada, it means that you’re cutting the tie between your wife and daughter. What do you think about that?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'sole custody' in their translation.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣住了五年, 我有這邊的居留權, 我也很喜歡這邊, 目前我並沒有離開台灣的計畫, 特別是我相信我女兒應該有權力能見到她的父母, 我要強調的是雖然我和我太太在打離婚官司, 但我並沒有打算切斷她們母女倆的聯繫, 在離婚官司的過程中我都會寄女兒的照片給她, 我甚至會安排時間為我們大家見面.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我已經在台灣住了五年' should be '我已經住在台灣五年了'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean you don’t have any plan to return to Canada at the moment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you mean' instead of 'You mean'.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不, 我回加拿大的原因只有可能是我媽老了病了. 就算如此我回去也不會停留太久, 我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒一起去
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我回加拿大的原因只有可能是我媽老了病了" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我回加拿大的原因可能只有是我媽媽老了病了".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense in the sentence "就算如此我回去也不會停留太久" is incorrect. The correct verb tense should be "就算如此我回去也不會停留太久".
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun "我" is repeated unnecessarily in the sentence "我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒一起去". The correct sentence should be "甚至不會考慮帶女兒一起去".

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I’m going to ask your wife some questions. You no longer live with your husband is that true?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes we’ve been parting for six months already.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'parting' should be 'separated' to agree with the subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
So when did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Well, about two month ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'applied' in the translation.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So that means, before you file the divorce, you no longer live together right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So what is your living condition at the moment? Who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I’m living with my son from my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So what marriage are we talking here?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他是我第二任先生。
He’s my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'husband' in a more formal sense.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the child rearing case is about your second child, which is your daughter
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'child rearing case' instead of 'child custody case'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adjective 'second' after the noun 'child', which should be 'second child' instead of 'child second'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the person involved in the child custody case being the speaker's ex-husband.

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son, and how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
After you move out, did your daughter live with you or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'is she' instead of 'is' alone.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
After I moved out, my daughter was just two months old, so she still needs me, and live with me.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'so she lives with me' instead of 'and live with me'.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
What about now? Who does the child live with
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter lives with my husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation changes the meaning of the original text.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Did you have any agreement? Why did she live with you at first, and now with your husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '協議' as 'agreement' instead of 'arrangement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'live' before the subject 'she' in the second sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter in the second sentence.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I move out, I live in a smaller place, so my husband has a bigger place. The environment is better, so I think she’s better off with my husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '我把孩子交給先生' as 'I think she’s better off with my husband.' The correct translation is 'I entrusted the child to my husband.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
Regardless of the objective circumstances, that’s still not…. Is that better for your daughter? So why do you want to get the sole custody of your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
After all, I’ve had her pregnant for ten months, she’s still my daughter. Besides, my husband is Canadian, and he doesn’t hold a stable job. In this concern, I may never see my daughter again. That’s why I want to get my daughter’s sole custody.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of giving birth to the daughter.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'I’ve had her pregnant' instead of 'I carried her for ten months'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '撫養權' as 'sole custody' instead of 'custody'.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
As for your financial status, can you elaborate how are you going to raise your daughter?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'ability' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'financial' and 'status' in the translation.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far, we’re still up with the divorce case. I’m fighting for the right to live in my husband’s place after the divorce case. Based on the environment, I think my husband’s place would be suitable for my daughter’s growing up. As for my financial status, I’ve provided an asset list for the court. And I also have a job with an income of 40000 NT a month. So I think I’m capable of raising my daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So may I ask how is your divorce case proceeding? Do you know when will the court’s decision be made?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be: 'May I ask how your divorce case is proceeding?'
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the part 'Or is it possible to know roughly when the decision will be made?'

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure, we will be in another court this Friday. I will ask the judge of the divorce case to come up with a court decision as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I will ask the judge of the divorce case to come up with a court decision as soon as possible.'

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
How about we send a social worker to see both of you? So the social worker will make an evaluation based on how you interact with your daughter. We will take that evaluation as reference to see what works the best for your daughter. But before that, have you come to think about share custody? Basically, share custody is to have your daughter spend a certain amount of time with her father, and a certain amount of time with her mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'So the social worker will make an evaluation based on how you interact with your daughter' is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'So the social worker will make an evaluation based on how you interact with your daughter.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement error is present in the sentence 'We will take that evaluation as reference to see what works the best for your daughter.' The correct form should be 'We will take that evaluation as a reference to see what works best for your daughter.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the social worker visiting both the '告訴人' and the '相對人'. The correct translation should include 'both of you' or 'both parties'.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user's translation adds the phrase 'have you come to think about' which is not present in the original text. The correct translation should be 'will you consider' or 'have you considered'.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of '共同撫養'. Instead of using the term 'share custody', the user translates it as 'share custody'. The correct translation should be 'joint custody'.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人是不太贊同這種作法, 因為我女兒還太小, 她才八個月大, 我不希望她經歷我和我太太之間的流離失所, 對這麼小的小孩來說, 讓她以這種方式長大的話她會很困惑
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'changes between me and my wife' as '流離失所' (displacement) instead of '改變' (changes).

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too little, she’s not suitable for a share custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'daughter'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'she’s not suitable for a share custody' does not accurately convey the meaning of '女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式'.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Ok, if that’s the case, we’ll first arrange a social worker to see how it goes. After there’s a result, we’ll arrange the next court time. And that both parties have the chance to elaborate.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After there’s a result, we’ll first arrange a social worker to see how it goes.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of a report being made by the social worker before arranging the next court time.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the mention of both parties having the opportunity to express their opinions.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
Ok, 我接受先讓社工來訪
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'accept' was translated as '接受' which means 'to accept' in the sense of agreeing to something. However, in this context, 'accept' should be translated as 'fine with' or 'okay with'.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I’m fine with that too.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有一個律師。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today, we are going to understand your attitudes towards child custody.And the court also wants why you both think that you have the right to take care of this child.So please elaborate this point particularly.Besides, I know that you are now engaged in a divorce case.So please avoid any verbal attack, please.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'And the court also wants why you both think that you have the right to take care of this child' is incorrect. It should be 'And the court also wants to know why you both think that you have the right to take care of this child.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence 'And the court also wants why you both think that you have the right to take care of this child.'

了解。
Yes, I understand.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
So first, I would like to ask the plaintiff some questions.The plaintiff, why do you want to be granted your child custody.As the court knows, you do not have a full-time job here in Taiwan.And you are a foreigner.On child custody, why do you think you have more custody than the other party?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我想要得到我女兒的單獨撫養權有兩個原因。第一，我的太太不再跟我住在一起了。我希望我可以陪我女兒長大。而且我聽到，我太太和別的男人同居。如果真的是這樣的話，我很懷疑他是否可以提供我女兒應得的照顧。所以我想要爭取撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我想要得到我女兒的單獨撫養權有兩個原因' (I want to get sole custody of my daughter for two reasons). The correct word order should be '有兩個原因我想要得到我女兒的單獨撫養權' (For two reasons, I want to get sole custody of my daughter).

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that you are now engaged in a divorce case and you are no longer living together?And you doubt that your wife is living with another man.Because of the above-mentioned circumstances, you are unwilling to give your daughter to your wife, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'And you doubt that your wife is living with another man' is incorrect. It should be 'And you doubt that your wife is living with another man?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '因為這種情況' as 'Because of the above-mentioned circumstances' is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as 'Because of this situation'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the children in the sentence '你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧'. It should be translated as 'you are unwilling to give your children to her for care'.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這就是我最擔心的原因。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
And regarding your financial status, if you are granted with your child’s sole custody, how can you take care of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在的確沒有全職的工作。但是我有好幾份兼差，也是有固定收入的。我相信這些固定的收入可以讓我和我女兒好好地生活。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在的確沒有全職的工作。'

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs at present.Because these jobs are just part-time, can you approximately estimate how much income is regularly?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均都會有四五個兼差工作。所以我一個月大概都會有五萬塊台幣的收入。如果我有得到更多案子的話，我的收入就會增加。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Is it possible that if you are granted with your child’s custody, you will go back to Canada and never come back again?The reason the courts asks so, even you are granted with the child custody, your wife can be granted with visitation right.If you brought your child back to Canada, it also made your daughter cut the tie with the mother. What’s your opinion to point?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'The question I want to ask' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'asks' before the subject 'the courts' instead of after it.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'cut the tie' as '隔離' which means 'isolate' instead of '斷絕' which means 'sever' or 'cut off'.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣住五年了。我得到了居留證，也很喜歡這裡。目前並沒有離開台灣的計劃。尤其我覺得我女兒應該要有見到他雙親的權利。我想要強調的是，雖然我和我太太正在打離婚官司，但我並沒有想要我女兒和我太太切斷聯繫。即使在我們的離婚訴訟進行中，我也是固定有寄我女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至安排了一些時間，邀請我太太和我女兒一起度過一些時光。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我女兒應該要有見到他雙親的權利' is incorrect. It should be '我女兒應該要有見到她雙親的權利'.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So, you mean that in a short time, you are not intended to go back to your homeland, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'So, you mean that you are not intended to go back to your homeland in a short time, right?'

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
是的，目前沒有這個計畫，但如果有一天我媽媽老了又生病的話。即使我回去，應該也不會待很久。我甚至也不會考慮帶我女兒一起回去。
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense in the translation is inconsistent with the original text. The original text uses the present tense ('my mother is old and sick'), while the translation uses the future tense ('如果有一天我媽媽老了又生病的話').
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The original text has 'I may go back to Canada', while the translation has '是的，目前沒有這個計畫' which means 'Yes, currently I don't have this plan'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker wouldn't consider taking their daughter with them. The original text explicitly states 'I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me', but this information is not present in the translation.

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now, the court would like to ask the defendant some questions. Are you no longer staying with your husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Are you no longer staying with your husband?'

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been no longer living together for six months.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
I filed the case around two months ago.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is 'I'.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So, before you filed the divorce, you hadn’t lived with your husband for a long time.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense should be past perfect tense 'hadn't lived' to indicate an action that occurred before another past action.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
What is your current living circumstances? I mean who are you living with now
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
Now, I am living with my son of my ex-husband?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So which marriage is it with the plaintiff.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
Now, the child custody we are here for is between the second husband, for the daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
And how old is your son, and how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight-month old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter' in number, so it should be 'eight months old' instead of 'eight-month old'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, was your daughter left by your husband or you brought her with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out, my daughter was only two-month old; therefore, I brought her with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needed the mother's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
And where is the child now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now, my daughter is living with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is living with my husband now.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there an agreement between you? Why you brought your daughter with you, and she is now with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I moved out, I found an apartment which is smaller than the place my husband is living. Taking living circumstances into consideration, my husband’s place is better than mine.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'my husband's place' instead of 'husband's place'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '對孩子比較優' as 'my husband’s place is better than mine'. The correct translation should be 'in terms of the environment, it is better for the children'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances remain the same, that is, your living environment, this is not better for your daughter, right? Why do you want to be granted with your child’s custody?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I gave birth to my daughter, so how could I be separated from her? And my husband is a Canadian, and he does not have a stable job here. He may go back to Canada at any time. If that is the case, I will never my daughter again. Therefore, I hope to be granted with my daughter’s custody.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the duration of the pregnancy, which is important for understanding the context of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'be' instead of 'see' in the phrase 'I will never my daughter again.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the husband's unstable job as a reason for potential separation from the daughter.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
As to your financial status, how could you afford your daughter’s spending?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we are still engaged in a divorce case. So, I would like to ask to live in the apartment my husband lives now after our divorce. Based on the living environment, the apartment will be suitable for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have provided my asset list to the court. Besides, I have stable job, my regular income is at least 40000 NT dollars per month. So, I think I have the ability to rear my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'So, I would like to ask to live in the apartment my husband lives now after our divorce.' The correct word order should be: 'So, I would like to ask to live in the apartment my husband lives in now after our divorce.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'Based on the living environment, the apartment will be suitable for my daughter to grow up.' The correct verb form should be 'is' instead of 'will be' to match the singular subject 'apartment'.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
And how is your divorce case going? Do you know the estimated date that the court’s decision comes out?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be: 'How is your divorce case going?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'your' in 'your divorce case'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'the court's decision' in 'the court's decision comes out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'estimated date' in 'the estimated date that the court's decision comes out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'the court's decision' in 'the court's decision comes out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'the court's decision' in 'the court's decision comes out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'the court's decision' in 'the court's decision comes out'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'the court's decision' in 'the court's decision comes out'.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. We have another court this Friday. I would like to ask the judge of the divorce case to give the court’s decision as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
So, the court will arrange some social workers to visit both of your places, the plaintiff and the defendant. And evaluate your relations with your daughter from your both sides. The court will take the social worker’s evaluation into consideration to give the court’s decision to make sure what is suitable for the child. Before that, the court would like to make sure that have you ever considered to share the custody? The shared custody means the child will live with the father for some time, and live with the mother for some time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'The court will take the social worker’s evaluation into consideration to give the court’s decision to make sure what is suitable for the child.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'The court would like to make sure that have you ever considered to share the custody?'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the phrase 'from your both sides' in the sentence 'And evaluate your relations with your daughter from your both sides.'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of the phrase 'to give the court’s decision' in the sentence 'The court will take the social worker’s evaluation into consideration to give the court’s decision to make sure what is suitable for the child.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase '共同持有撫養權' in the sentence 'Before that, the court would like to make sure that have you ever considered to share the custody?'
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	Addition of the phrase 'The shared custody means the child will live with the father for some time, and live with the mother for some time.' in the sentence 'Before that, the court would like to make sure that have you ever considered to share the custody?'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不太考慮這一點，因為我女兒還太小。他只有八個月大而已。我不想要他跟經歷我和太太的離異過程。對一個那麼小的小孩來講，可能會造成他認知上的混淆，如果他必須跟他的父親住一段時間，又再去跟母親住一段時間的話。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'She is only 8 months old.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'go through the changes between me and my wife' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'experience the changes between me and my wife.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'stay with one parent for a certain period of time and then with the other parent.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of not wanting the daughter to go through the changes between the parents.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the confusion it may cause for the daughter.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
As to this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young to arrange this way at such a young age.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I agree with my husband on this point.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not suitable for co-parenting arrangement.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
If that is the case, we will schedule first the visits of the social workers. After they finish their evaluation, we will schedule our next court date. So, the both parties have the chance to state your opinions. Is that all right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'So, both parties have the chance to state their opinions.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
是的，我接受社工來訪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no problems, too. Thank you.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today what I mainly want to do is to understand what is your standpoint on your child custody, and I would also like to know why you think you are the more appropriate one to rear the child. Please focus on this point and elaborate. In addition, I know you are also filing for a divorce case, so I hope that won’t make any verbal attack each other. Is that OK with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Please focus on this point and elaborate' is incorrect. It should be 'Please focus on this point and elaborate on it.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'won't' should be 'don't' to match the subject 'you'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the preparation procedures in the original text.

了解。
OK, I understand.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I would like to ask the plaintiff some questions. Why would you like to…why would you like your child’s custody? As far as I am concerned, now in Taiwan you don’t have a full-time job. You are a foreigner. On the matter of child custody, why do you think you are the more appropriate person?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why would you like custody of your child?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'child custody' as 'child's custody', which changes the meaning slightly.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the plaintiff not having a full-time job, which is an important detail in the context of the question.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the plaintiff being a foreigner, which is another important detail in the context of the question.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我主要…我想要就是全部的小孩撫養權有兩個原因。首先，我的太太沒有再跟我們一起住了，我想要在那裡看我女兒長大，而且我聽說我太太跟另外一個男人住在一起。如果是那樣子的話，我懷疑她到底能不能給我們的小孩最好的照顧。因此，我希望有全部的撫養權。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我主要…我想要就是全部的小孩撫養權有兩個原因'.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
What you mean is that although your wife is still going on a divorce case with you, she no longer lives with you, and you also doubt that she lives with another man. So…because of the…based on the above reasons, you don’t want the child to be raised by her, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，這是我主要的顧慮。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
As to your financial status, that is to say, if you don’t have a full-time job, how are you going to raise your child…your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實是沒有全職的工作，但是我有幾個…幾個工作，收入也很固定。這個固定收入可以讓我照顧我自己跟我的女兒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有幾個工作' instead of '我現在是沒有全職的工作'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '收入也很固定' is translated as 'the income is also fixed' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'regular income'.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just said that you have several part-time jobs. Because all of them are part-time jobs, can you estimate how much income you have each month?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均來說有四到五份兼職工作，全部加起來的話，每個月大概有五萬多塊台幣，如果我有其他額外的工作的話，收入可能會更多。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another thing I want to ask is that, is it possible that after you get your child’s custody, you will take her to Canada and not coming back? The reason I ask is that although you get your custody, your wife still have the visitation right, and she can regularly visit your daughter. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, you will be indirectly cutting the tie between them…between your wife and your daughter. So…about this, what is your opinion?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the father taking the child to Canada after getting custody.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待五年了。我有居留證，而且我蠻喜歡…我很喜歡這裡。我目前沒有離開台灣的打算，而且我覺得小孩有權利見他的父母。我想說的是，就算我現在要跟我老婆離婚，我沒有打算要切斷我女兒和我老婆的聯繫。在打離婚官司的期間，我…就是定期會傳女兒的照片給老婆看。我甚至還會…就是安排一起出去玩，讓老婆也可以看看小孩。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '我蠻喜歡…我很喜歡這裡'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Incorrect translation of 'my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents' as '小孩有權利見他的父母' which means 'the child has the right to see his parents'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'I have an ARC' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'I want to emphasize that' in the translation

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter' in the translation

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So what you’re saying that so far you don’t have a plan…to go back to Canada, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
對，我有可能會回去，但只是因為我媽年紀大了或生病之類的，但是就算我回去，我也不會待太久。我根本就不會想要把女兒一起帶去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我媽年紀大了或生病之類的" is incorrect. It should be "我媽年紀大了或生病之類的".
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb "回去" should be future tense to match the original text. It should be "我會回去".
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase "我根本就不會想要把女兒一起帶去" does not accurately convey the meaning of "I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me."

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I would like to ask the other party some questions. Do you no longer live with your husband now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been separated for six months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you…when did you file your divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That is to say, before you filed your divorce case, you longer live together, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So who do you live with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son, who is the child of my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So…this time…
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the question about the number of marriages.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister'.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the custody we’re not talking about is…with your husband and is a daughter…your daughter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'the custody we're not talking about', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order should be 'is a daughter...your daughter'.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
So how old is your son? How old is your daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is five months old…eight months old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'eight months old' instead of 'five months old'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you are…separate with your husband, is your daughter with you or with your husband…was.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When…because at that time my daughter was only two months old, she needed my care, so I took her with me.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about moving out.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used '孩子跟我' instead of '我帶著孩子'.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So where is…where is the child now? Is she with you or with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Where is the child now?' instead of 'So where is...where is the child now?'

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is with my husband.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Did you have some sort of negotiation before? Why is your…why was her with you a few months ago, and now she is with your husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '協議' as 'negotiation' instead of 'agreement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter's change in relationship from the original text.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I moved out, my house was smaller. The one I lived with my husband is bigger. Because the environment is better, I sent my daughter to my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'After I moved out, my house was smaller' is incorrect. It should be 'After I moved out, my house became smaller.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'The one I lived with my husband is bigger' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'The one I lived in with my husband is bigger.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the environment is better in the new place. It should be 'Because the environment is better, I sent my daughter to my husband.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So…if the objective circumstances are not changed...your living place, the environment is still better for your daughter, right? So why do you want your child’s custody, then?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter who I spent ten months bearing…ten months…how would I bear not seeing her? And my husband is Canadian. He’s work in Taiwan is not very stable. He will possibly go back to Canada at any time. In that case, I wouldn’t see my daughter anymore, right? So I would like to…so I would like to have my daughter’s custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'She is my daughter who I spent ten months bearing…ten months…how would I bear not seeing her?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'And my husband is Canadian. He’s work in Taiwan is not very stable.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'He will possibly go back to Canada at any time.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'I hope to' in the sentence 'So I would like to have my daughter’s custody.'

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Based on your financial status…can you…can you tell us how you are going to rear your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we are still going on the divorce case. I hope that now we can let our daughter live in my husband’s house now. Based…in concerned of the environment, the house is better for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have give…I have gave…I have given the court my asset list. In addition, I also have a full-time job, I income every month is 40,000 dollars. I think I am capable of raising my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Based…in concerned of the environment'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'I income every month is 40,000 dollars'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'provide' in the sentence 'I have give…I have gave…I have given the court my asset list'.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce case going on now? Do you know when…when…when we will see the result, or about when we will see the result of the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not quite sure. We will go on the court for the divorce case on this Friday again. I hope that I can tell the judge of the divorce case that the sentence be granted as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'sentence' should be 'judgment' in this context.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Maybe…we will ask a social worker to regularly visit the plaintiff and the other party and make some evaluation based on seeing your relationship between you and your daughter. The court will…will take reference of their reports and see which party is better of raising the child. Before that, I would like to ask if you both…are you willing to have shared custody? That means that your daughter will be living with husband…with her father for a while and with her mother for another time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Before that, I would like to ask if you both…are you willing to have shared custody?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '本庭' as 'the court will' instead of 'the court'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親' which means 'for a while with the father and for another time with the mother'.

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this issue, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small for…to young for shared custody...to be raising by shared custody…to be raised custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'Our daughter is too young for shared custody.'

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So, if that is the case, we will arrange for social worker’s visit. After we read their reports, we will arrange our next trial to let both of you state your standpoint. Is that OK with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'After we read their reports, we will arrange our next trial to let both of you state your standpoint.' The correct word order should be: 'After we read their reports, we will arrange our next trial to let both of you state your standpoint.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'social worker' in the sentence: 'So, if that is the case, we will arrange for social worker’s visit.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
嗯，我覺得社工探視可以。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '我覺得' (I think) is added, which changes the meaning to 'I think social workers' visits are okay' instead of simply stating 'I am fine with social workers' visits.'

沒有問題，謝謝。
I don’t have any questions…It’s also OK with you…with me.

你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
So why did you help him to take the golf bag to taiwan
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker in the translation.

He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
他說他會給我美金一千塊作為江高爾夫球帶帶來的酬勞。我想要賺一點小錢，我想說這是一個很簡單的工作。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '江高爾夫球' (golf) is used instead of '袋子' (bag).

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
The cell phone you just answer, is that cell phone is the confiscate in the tauyuan international airport
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of the cultural reference 'confiscate'

Yes, a Nokia phone.
對就是那隻nokia 的手機
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '隻' is used to count small animals or objects, not for phones.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the investigatory file, which is important for understanding the context.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
對這是他給我的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is this your personal cell phone?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'this', so it should be 'Is this your personal cell phone?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不是這不是我的手機。這隻手機是肯特的，他把sim卡插進那隻手機裡面然後交給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不是這不是我的手機' instead of '不是這不是我的手機'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'mobile phone' is translated as '手機' which is correct, but the word 'phone' is translated as '手機' again, resulting in repetition and incorrect meaning. It should be translated as '手機' in the first instance and '隻' in the second instance.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the mobile phone was given by Kent. This detail is important for understanding the context.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷的前一天把手機交給我。除了手機之外，他還給我400塊美金供我在旅館的吃住

他說他會透過這隻手機跟我聯絡
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他說他會透過這隻手機跟我聯絡'.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
So you mean that after you arrive to Taiwan, there will be someone who get contact with you,and then meet you and take the golf bag, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea of someone contacting and meeting the person to take the golf bag.

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對，肯特跟我說在我入境後不久，就會有人跟我聯絡並拿走高爾夫球袋
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bag' as '高爾夫球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of the intended meaning of 'bag'.

不，我不知道誰會打給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You just mention that beside the golf bag and the cell phone,he also  give you 400 us dollars. Is this monetary compensation too?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '算是酬勞嗎？' as 'Is this monetary compensation too?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks if the 400 US dollars can be considered as compensation, not if it is too much.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想這些錢應該是用來支付我旅館的開
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of meals in their translation.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
Beside these 400 dollars, after you go back to Tailand, you will get another 1000 us dollar,right? is that what you mean?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'After you go back to Thailand, will you get another 1000 US dollars?'

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
對這是我的認知。在我把這個高爾夫球袋交給別人之後，我就會回到泰國，然後得到這1000塊美金的酬勞
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and coming back to Bangkok to receive another thousand dollars, while the user's translation talks about handing over a golf bag to someone and receiving a reward of $1000.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
Before you accept this please, did you know it was heroine?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '海洛因' as 'heroine' instead of 'heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不我完全不知道，我不知道毒品藏在高爾夫球袋裡面。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'club' as '高爾夫球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of '俱樂部' which means 'club'.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you doubt that he just send you to bring the gold to Taiwan.  And this monetary compensation, which this 1000 us dollars, isn’t that little bit high?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我是不知道這代價是否太高，我只知道這些錢很好賺。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'that's too much' is translated as '這代價是否太高' which means 'whether the price is too high' instead of 'if that's too much'.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you ever wonder why don’t that person just bring the golf bag by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特說他很忙碌，他需要有個人來幫他。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'need' should agree with the subject 'Kent', so it should be 'he needs' instead of 'he need'.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even though you know what you bring is gold, you should know that bring the gold might be illegal , isn’t it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed in the translation.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道黃金在曼谷其實算是便宜了，但我不知道把黃金帶來台灣是不是合法的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the gold is cheaper in Thailand, but the user's translation states that gold is actually cheap in Bangkok.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of Bangkok as the location where gold is cheaper. This detail is important for understanding the context of the statement.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why don’t you think that there will be no problem to bring the gold to Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就是黃金，它應該不會帶來任何麻煩吧？
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Did you check the bag before you take the golf bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of checking the contents of the bag.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
不我沒有，因為那個袋子是密封的。我不覺得我應該要把它打開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'No, I didn't because that bag was sealed.'

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
So you trust him, and you don’t think you will be conned.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月的時候遇到肯特，我想那個時候我會為他工作，甚至跟他合作。他看起來是好人，我也不覺得他會騙我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我想那個時候我會為他工作，甚至跟他合作" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我想那個時候我會跟他合作，甚至為他工作".

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
You mean that Kant seem to be cooperate with you ,so you trust him, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by changing the meaning of '不疑有他' (not doubting him) to 'trust him'.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對我以為我們會一起當工作伙伴，所以我信任他。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我信任他' instead of '對我以為我們會一起當工作伙伴，所以我信任他。'

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
Do you have anything to add beside what you just mentioned?Is there any evidence that you want to ask court to help you investigate.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'Is there any evidence that you want to ask court to help you investigate.'

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我對整件事情感到很抱歉。我不知道那個袋子裡有什麼東西。如果我知道裡面是海落英的話，我是絕對不會把它帶來台灣的。

除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？
Except for Kant, do you have any more concrete information that may help the police to help you to find who gave you the bag?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
我就只有他那隻手機而已。

他叫我在曼谷的一家肯德基跟他碰
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'KFC' as '肯德基' which is the Chinese translation of KFC, instead of using the original English term.

你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
Then why would you help him carry the golf bag to Taiwan?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'him' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
我想賺錢啊 這對我來說是一個輕鬆的工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這對我來說是一個輕鬆的工作，我想賺錢啊。'

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
You mean he will give you the monetary compensation of 1000 us dollar for just bringing the bag to Taiwan, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
對阿 他跟我說我不用做其他的事,只需要把袋子帶到台灣就好
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the person only needs to bring the golf bag to Taiwan, while the user's translation suggests that the person does not need to do anything else.

對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
Then, did he tell you what would happen after you get into Taiwan? I mean, would there be anyone getting into contact with you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
他叫我待在一間旅館裡,然後就會有人打電話到他給我的手機
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'designated hotel'.

你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
The cellphone mentioned, is it the one that was confiscated by the police at the Taoyuan International Airport?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '扣案' as 'confiscated' instead of 'seized'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the police in their translation.

Yes, a Nokia phone.
對阿是一隻諾基亞的手機
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '手機' (mobile phone) is used instead of 'phone'.

提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
Now let’s look at the evidence, the defendant please verify that is it the cellphone you just mentioned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
對 這就是肯特給我的那支手機
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Does it belong to you?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'belong' should agree with the subject 'it', so it should be 'Does it belong to you?'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
沒有 這不是我的!這是肯特給我的阿,他把sim卡放到裡面,然後給我這支手機
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這不是我的!' instead of '沒有 這不是我的!'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'No' as '沒有' is incorrect. The correct translation should be '不是' to convey the meaning of 'No' in this context.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'mobile phone' in the second sentence, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'Kent' in the second sentence, which is an important detail in the original text.

你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
You mean this cellphone was given by the one who asked you to carry the golf bag?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
對 他就是在肯德基給我這支手機的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
Then when did he give you the cellphone? Other than the cellphone, did he give you any other things?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did he give you the cellphone?'
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'Then' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the question mark at the end of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation incorrectly places the word 'Other' before 'than'. It should be 'Other than the cellphone'.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'any' before 'other things'. It should be 'did he give you any other things?'

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我這支手機,除了手機之外他還給我美金四百元來付旅館及吃飯的費用

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
What’s the purpose that he gave you the cellphone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他說他會透過這支手機跟我聯絡 還有要來拿這個高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這支手機跟我聯絡
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他說他會透過這支手機跟我聯絡，還有要來拿這個高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這支手機跟我聯絡。'

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
That is, when you bring this cellphone to Taiwan, there will be somebody contact you and make an appointment with you to take the golf bag, right?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對阿 肯特跟我說我來台灣之後會有人打給我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying that someone was going to contact and meet the user to take the bag, the user's translation mentions that someone will call the user after they arrive in Taiwan.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Then did you know who would contact you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
沒有耶 我不知道誰會打給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
You’ve mentioned that other than the cellphone, Kent also gave you 400 us dollar, was that part of the monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我覺得這筆錢應該是用來支付我的旅館還有吃飯的費用而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'just' in the original text, which indicates that the payment is limited to hotel bills and meals only.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So you mean besides the 400 us dollar, after you successfully go back to Thailand, you will get another 1000 us dollar, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '美金' as 'us dollar' instead of 'USD'.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
就我所知是這樣啦,在我來台灣把這個包包交給那個人之後,我就會回去泰國然後拿到那一千元
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So when you took this job, did you know what you carried is heroine?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '海洛因' as 'heroine' instead of 'heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不  我完全不知道球桿裡面有藏海洛因
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think if he just asked you to bring gold to Taiwan, the monetary compensation, that is 1000 us dollar, is a little bit high
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我也不知道這個酬勞有沒有太高/ 我就想多賺一點錢啊
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I don't know if that's too much', the user's translation says 'I don't know if the remuneration is too high'.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Then did you wonder why that guy wouldn’t bring it by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
他跟我說他很忙 需要有人幫他
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他跟我說他需要有人幫他很忙'.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Even though what really in the golf bag was gold, you should have known that carrying gold into Taiwan may violate the law, isn’t it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '入境' as 'into Taiwan' instead of 'entering the country'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'isn't it?' instead of 'isn't it?' to match the subject-verb agreement.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我只知道黃金在泰國比較便宜 可是我不知道帶來台灣會犯法耶
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why would you think it’s okay to bring gold to Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
就只是黃金阿 也不會有什麼大問題吧
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Did you check the thing inside when you get this bag?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'inside' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有耶 因為袋子封起來了 我不覺得打開他是洽當的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為袋子封起來了，所以我不覺得可以打開它。'

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
So you trust Kent that much, don’t you think you may be conned?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月遇到肯特 那個時候我可能會替他工作 我們也可能會成為夥伴  他看起來人很好啊 我不覺得他會騙我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'work mates' as '夥伴' which means 'partners' instead of '同事' which means 'colleagues'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '在三月' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb '遇到'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that there was a possibility of becoming work mates in the future.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
You mean Kent wanted to cooperate in business you so you trust him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對阿 我就覺得我們會一起工作  所以我才這麼相信他
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
So other than the question you have answered, is there anything you want to state? Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我真的感到很抱歉 我不知道袋子裡面有什麼 他們跟我說是黃金阿 如果我當時知道是海洛因的話 我絕對不會把他帶到台灣的  拜託啦 原諒我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'gold' as '黃金' which means 'gold', but the original text mentioned 'heroin'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'I don't know what was hidden in the bag' in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'Please forgive me' in their translation.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail of providing any other specific information that could help the police identify the person who gave them the job.

All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
You are detained now, is there anyone you want us to inform
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'on your behalf' which is important for conveying the meaning that the person being detained wants someone else to be informed.

Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
可以幫我聯絡我在曼谷的家人或在英國的小孩嗎?他們一定很擔心我 我本來12月底要回去曼谷
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'contact' as '幫我聯絡' which means 'help me contact' instead of simply '聯絡' which means 'contact'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.

下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。
The next court will be investigatory procedure, you can choose the lawyer, and after you have chosen the lawyer, the lawyer will contact you and understand the case, do you understand? If it’s necessary, your lawyer can help you contact you family. Do you understand?
