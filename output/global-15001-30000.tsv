第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? So what is … this marriage?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So now the custody … you are argue about is the daughter of your second marriage.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight-month old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'daughter' in number.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out the house, was your daughter with your or your husband?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'was' should agree with the subject 'daughter', so it should be 'was your daughter with you or your husband?'

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out the house, because my daughter … is still young, she went out with me.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific age of the daughter.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'went' instead of 'went out'.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Then now … who does the child live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is living with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Now my daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why the daughter lived with you first and now is living with your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'husband' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'lived with you first' and 'is living with your husband now'.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I moved out, the house I lived is a little bit small. My husband’s house is bigger.In terms of the environment, I think my husband’s house is better for my child so I gave my daughter to him.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '交給' as 'gave' instead of 'entrusted'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misinterpretation of '先生' as 'husband' instead of 'father'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances don’t change, that is to say, …your daughter does live with your husband is a better choice.Then why do you want to be granted with the custody of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter and I have spent ten months to give birth to her. I absolutely want her custody.In addition, my husband’s nationality is Canada. He also doesn’t have a full-time job. I’m concerning about that he might go back to Canada from time to time.In that case, doesn’t it mean that I can’t see my daughter?That is the reason why I want to be granted with the custody of my daughter.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
In terms of your financial status, can you elaborate how can you raise your child?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'daughter' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'financial status' and 'can you elaborate' in the translation.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far, we are still in the divorce case.I hope I can be granted with the right to live in the house of y husband.As far as the house is concerned, I think that place is pretty good for my daughter to live.As for my financial status, I already sent a document about my asset list to the court.Besides, I also have a job. Every month, I have approximately at least forty thousand dollars as an income.I think I do have the ability to raise my child.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
May I ask how is your divorce case going?Do you know when the verdict will come out about your divorce case?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'now' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation, resulting in an incorrect sentence structure.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure.We will have the court this Friday about the divorce case.I would like to tell the court that I hope the verdict of the divorce case will come out soon.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, we now will send some social workers to visit …both of you.In addition, they will evaluate your interaction with your child.We will …take their evaluation into account when deciding the verdict of this case.However, I want to ask that do both party would consider the joint custody.What joint custody means is that the child will spend some time with the Father and also the other time with Mother.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the social workers' visit and evaluation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the social workers' evaluation will be used to determine the best arrangement for the child.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not use commas to separate the different parts of the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'verdict' instead of 'arrangement' to describe the decision regarding the child.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate 'joint custody' into the target language.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人是不想要這樣的裁定，因為我的女兒太小了她只有八個月大我不想她被我和我妻子之間送來送去的對於這樣歲數的小孩子來說，這樣的環境對他們來說也太混亂了吧，一下子和母親待一段時間，一下子和父親待一段時間
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added phrase '對於這樣歲數的小孩子來說，這樣的環境對他們來說也太混亂了吧'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '一下子和母親待一段時間，一下子和父親待一段時間'

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
To this point, I agree with my husband’s opinion.My daughter is too young. We shouldn’t and don’t want to accept this verdict of joint custody.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
To this case, we are going to send social workers for visitation.After social workers make the report, we will resume the case.And at that time, you will have the floor to elaborate your opinion.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of arranging a court date after the social workers make their report.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'And at that time' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'we will resume the case.'

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我對社工的部分沒有問題
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'visits' in their translation.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I’m fine with that, too.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Your honor. Today I mainly want to verify the child custody in the marriage. I would also like to know that why both of you think that you can raise the child alone. Please elaborate this point further. Besides, I also know that both of you are also under the case of divorce. Therefore, I hope that both of you can avoid verbal attack in this court.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, defendant, may I ask you some questions? Why do you want to fight for the custody of your child? Based on my understanding, you don’t a fulltime job in Taiwan, and you’re a foreigner. In the process of the fighting for custody, what’s your advantages?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'may I ask you some questions?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'defendant' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the phrase 'First,'

omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the information about the defendant not having a full-time job and being a foreigner
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the question about the advantages the defendant believes they have in the custody battle

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望能夠得到小孩的全部扶養權，因為有以下兩個原因。首先我太太已經不跟我們住了。我想要陪在我孩子旁邊看他長大。此外，我太太也跟另外一個男人居住。如果這是真的的話，我懷疑我太太是不是能給我們的小孩最好的照顧。因此我想要單獨扶養。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that your wife is… when you’re fighting for the case of divorce, your wife no longer lives with you. Is that right? And you also doubt that she lives another man. Is it because of this kind of condition that you don’t want to share custody with her?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	rearranging the sentence structure
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the original meaning

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這些都是我主要的顧慮

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Besides, concerning your financial status, if you’re granted with the custody, what do you plan to raise your child?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在的確沒有全職工作。但是我有很多兼職工作，這也有份固定的收入。我相信這份收入能夠支撐我和我女兒的生活。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. So because they’re all part-time jobs, so could you tell us that how much money will you gain on a regular basis.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
平均而言我有四到五個兼職工作。總共來說大概會有五萬塊的收入。有時候如果有新的計劃的時候，我也會有額外的收入。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
My another question is that will you bring your daughter back to Canada and no longer stays in Taiwan after you’re granted with the custody? The reason why I asked so is that even if you are granted with the custody, your wife may also be granted with the visitation right. If you bring your child back to Canada, you will become, to a degree, cut the tie between your wife and your child. To this, what’s your plea?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'plea'

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年。我有居留證，我也喜歡這個地方。目前為止我沒有任何離開台灣的計畫。特別是因為我認為我的女兒有權利見到爸爸媽媽。我想說的是，雖然我和我太太現在正在打離婚的官司，我從來沒有想過要切斷她和我女兒之間的聯繫。在整個離婚官司的過程中，我會固定寄女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至安排了一些行程，讓他和女兒能夠見面。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean that in the short run you don’t have the plan to go back to Canada.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
我的確有回加拿大的打算，因為我母親年邁且身體不好。然而就算我回去加拿大的話我也不會待太久。我也不會考慮把女兒帶著一起回加拿大的可能。

Now, Ms. 石, I have some questions for you. Don’t you live with your husband anymore?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the name of the person being addressed.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the name 'Ms. 石' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'ask'.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been separated for six months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case of divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
In other words, much earlier before your filing divorce case, you no longer lives with him. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So could you tell us your living condition? I mean, who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son in my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? What the marriage between Mr. Johnson.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the number of marriages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Mr. Johnson' after the verb 'is', resulting in incorrect word order.

他是我第二任先生。
He’s my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in Chinese.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So, we’re dealing with the custody of your second husband and your daughter in your second marriage.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, your daughter stays with who? You or your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I was moving out, because she’s only two months old, so she stayed with me.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needed the mother's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
What does your daughter stay with?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'now' in the translation.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there some kind of arrangement between you two? Why was the daughter staying with you, and then is staying with your husband.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'arrangement' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'daughter' and 'you' in the translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你' as 'your husband' instead of 'you'.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The apartment after I moved out is quite smaller. The original house is bigger. In terms of the living condition, my husband can provide a better environment.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The apartment after I moved out is quite smaller' is incorrect. It should be 'The apartment I moved out of is quite smaller'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the original house' is translated as 'the original house' instead of 'my husband's house'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances aren’t changed. Your living condition isn’t good for your daughter, isn’t it? Then why do you hope for the custody of your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Therefore, I hope to fight for the custody. As for your financial status, could you elaborate that how you are going to raise your child.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the part about the speaker's financial ability to support the daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the sentence about fighting for custody in the wrong position, making the sentence structure unclear.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are currently in the case of divorce. I hope that I can get my husband’s house after the case. So in terms of the living condition, that house is very appropriate for my daughter. And as for my personal financial status, I have provided the court a copy of my asset list. Besides, I have a fulltime job. I can earn around 40000 per month. I think I am able to raise my daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So how’s your divorce case going? When will the court’s decisions be made? I mean do you roughly know the time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure about it. This week we have another court. I want express my idea to the court that I wish the court can be finished as soon as possible.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Now let us do this. The court will arrange social workers to your children. And they will make evaluation about the relationship between you and your child. That will be the court’s reference to see who is better for the child. Before that I want to ask that will you consider the possibility of shared custody? The definition of shared custody is that the child stays with father for some time and stays with the mother for another time.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不喜歡這個提案，因為我女兒還太小，他只有八個月大。我不希望他在我和我太太之間搬來搬去。這個方式對這麼年幼的小孩來說太混淆了，怎麼可以讓她一下跟爸爸住一下跟媽媽住呢
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '怎麼可以讓她一下跟爸爸住一下跟媽媽住呢' (how can she live with dad for a while and then with mom?)

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
Concerning this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small. She is not supposed to go through the process of shared custody.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So we will have the social workers get to you first. After they finish the report, we will arrange the court date to give the opinion rights of both parties.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我對社工探視沒有意見
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'fine' which indicates the speaker's positive response to social workers' visits.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I’m fine with it too, thanks.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today we are here for preparation procedure between Ferry Johnson and TSAI YUN SHR of their child rearing. Do both parties have the lawyers?

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today, we just want to know the both parties’ status of this case. We also want to know why both parties think they are more suitable for child rearing. Please just state for this point. And, I know you just in the case of divorce. In the court, we don’t want to see verbal attack.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I want to ask the questions. Plaintiff, why do you want to have the custody of your child? As I know, you don’t have full-time job now in Taiwan. And you are a foreigner. Why would you think you are more suitable for this case?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	incorrect use of pronouns

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望得到孩子的扶養權因為下列的原因。首先，我的老婆不再陪著我們。我想要跟著我的女兒一起成長。此外，我知道我的老婆和別的男人現在正在一起。如果那是真的，我很懷疑我的老婆是否有辦法好好照顧我們的女兒。因此，我希望能爭取全部扶養權。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using '爭取全部扶養權' instead of '獲得獨自扶養權'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	translating '扶養權' as 'custody' instead of 'sole custody'

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that you are in the case of divorce with your wife, and she doesn’t live with you now? And you think she lives with other man? Because of this concern, you don’t want to your child lives with her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker suspects his wife is living with another man.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'lives' before the subject 'she' instead of using the correct word order.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧' as 'you don’t want your child lives with her' instead of 'you don’t want to give your child to her for care'.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
沒錯，那就是我所擔憂的。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Furthermore, it’s about your financial status. If you have the custody of your child, what’s your plan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of personal financial ability.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'it's about your financial status' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'Furthermore'.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
沒錯，我現在在台灣並沒有全職的工作。但是我有七份兼職工作，那使我的收入跟全職收入一樣多。我相信這樣的收入足夠負擔我和我女兒的生活費。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'several part-time jobs' is not accurately conveyed.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mention that you have many part time jobs. Because all of them are part time jobs, you think you may have how much fixed income every month?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of estimating the fixed income.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'may have' before the subject 'you'. The correct word order should be 'you may have'.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有四到五份兼職工作。平均來說，我一個月會有五萬元收入。有時候如果我額外接收到工作，我會有更多的收入。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
For the other question that I want to ask is that if you get the custody of your child, will you go to Canada and never come back again? I asked the question just because even if you have the custody, your wife may remain the visitation right. If you bring your child to your country, it may become a problem that you deliberately separate the child and your wife. For this point, what’s your point?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣生活了五年，我擁有居留證而且我喜愛這個地方，到目前為止我沒有離開台灣的任何打算，而且我的女兒有權利見到我和我太太。我必須強調的是，即使我和我太太正在進行離婚官司，但我並沒有想要切斷小孩和我太太的關係。在打官司的期間，我也有將我女兒的照片傳給我老婆。我甚至鼓勵他和我女兒見面。

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So, you mean that you don’t have the plan to go back your country, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
也不是這樣說，我也是有可能回去看我的母親，因為她已經很老了。就算我回去的話，我也不會在那邊待很久，我甚至考慮帶我女兒一起去的可能性。

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Ok. I want to ask the question of the other party. So, do you live with your husband now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
We live separately for six months.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'We have been living separately for six months.'

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file a divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Maybe two months before.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific information about what they provided two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So, before you filed the case, you didn’t live with your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
What’s you living status? I mean, you live with whom?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son who is from my first marriage.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the son is living with the speaker.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question word '那' (which) in the translation, resulting in the omission of the critical context of the question.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the question mark at the end of the sentence instead of after the question word 'First marriage?'

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'He is my second husband.'

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So, the custody that we concern about is between your second husband and you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the children in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the order of the subject and verb in the translation.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
 How old is your son? And how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old. My daughter is eight months.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation after 'old'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'eight months'

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you went out, your daughter lived with you or your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'moved' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'your daughter' after the verb 'lived' instead of before it.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
 Because when I went out, my daughter was only 2 months, she needed me and she lived with me.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needs the speaker's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
 Now, the child lives with whom?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now, my daughter lives with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'Now, my daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you have any agreement? Why your daughter lived with you first, and now she lives with your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
  The place that I live now is not big so my child lives with my husband. For environmental concern, my daughter lives with my husband now.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the original house being bigger than the current place.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the context that the decision to let the child live with the husband was based on the better environment.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '先生' as 'husband' instead of 'Mr.'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
Just for the objective circumstances, the situation for your daughter is not good, right? Why would you have the custody of your child?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	rearranging the sentence structure

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my child, how could I live without her? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian, and he might go back to Canada any time. If that’s a case, I cannot meet my daughter anymore. So, I want to have the custody.

omission or addition	omission of details	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs
omission or addition	omission of details	inserting content not present in the original text

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your financial status, can you explain more that how would you rear your child?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'explain' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'more' in the wrong position in the sentence.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are in divorce case now. I hope, after the case, I can live in the house that my husband lives now. The house is good for my daughter to grow up. For my financial status, I just turned in my asset list for the court. Furthermore, I have a job, and the income is NT40000 each month. I think I can be capable of rearing my child.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the current divorce case.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing a financial statement to the court.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of having a fixed job.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the house being suitable for the daughter's growth.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How’s your divorce case now? When will the sentence out?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'going' before 'on' in the first sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'now' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'case'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'the' before 'sentence' in the second sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'out' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'sentence'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'the' before 'sentence' in the third sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'out' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'sentence'.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. This Friday, we will go to the court again. I want to tell the judge who charges our divorce case that I hope the sentence out fast.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'sentence' instead of 'judgment'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	using 'charge' instead of 'preside over'

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok, so, the court will arrange the social workers to visit both parties. And the social workers will evaluate the situation. After the court sees the report, we will think who is better for the child. But before that, do both parties want to share the custody? The term of shared custody means that sometimes the child lives with father and sometimes lives with mother.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
 就目前來說，我並不想這麼打算，因為我的小孩還太小。她只有八個月大，我不希望她一直在我和我老婆之間來來回回。對於這麼小的小孩來說，對於她一下要來這邊一下要去那邊，會讓她感到困擾。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
For this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small, and it’s not suitable for shared custody.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of not only the daughter's age but also the fact that it is not appropriate for shared custody.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
We will arrange social workers’ visitation first. After they finish the report, we will set the next court date. Both parties will have chance to state, is that ok?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the social workers' visitation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'is that ok?' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'Both parties will have a chance to state'.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
是的，我對於社工參訪沒有意見。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'workers' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

沒有問題，謝謝。
Yes.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I want to ask some question of the defendant. Would you please state why you want the custody of your child? As I know, you do not have a full-time job in Taiwan, and you are a foreigner, in the case of child rearing, why do think you are more better then the other?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question asking the defendant to state why they want custody of their child.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the question asking the defendant to state why they want custody of their child after mentioning the defendant's lack of a full-time job and foreigner status.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭取子女撫養權' as 'the custody of your child' instead of 'child custody rights'.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望你能夠把女兒全部的撫養權都判給我。第一點是：我的妻子沒有和我住在一起了。我希望看著我的孩子成長。此外，我也聽說我的妻子現在正和其他男人住在一起。如果這是事實的話，那我會懷疑我的妻子是否能給我們的女兒最好的照顧。因此這就是我希望有全部撫養權的原因。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'because of two concerns' which provides important context for the request for sole custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '全部的撫養權' (sole custody) before the verb '判給' (grant), resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the phrase '你能夠' (you can) instead of '希望' (hope), which changes the meaning of the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'best care she deserves' as '最好的照顧' (best care), which does not convey the same meaning as the original text.

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
 Do you mean you and your wife are having the divorce trial, and she does not live with you, and you also suspect that she is living with another man, so because of the two reasons you do not want to let your wife have the custody, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the husband's suspicion that the wife is living with another man.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
沒錯，那是我主要的考量。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Besides, at the point of the financial status, if you have the sole custody of your daughter, what would you do?

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有全職的工作是個事實。但是我有幾份固定的收入，能夠幫助我們生活。我相信這幾份收入可以讓我和我女兒過生活。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of having several part-time jobs.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned before that you have several part-time jobs, because those are part-time jobs, can you guarantee that you will have a fixed income?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of estimating the monthly fixed income.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平常有4～5份的兼職工作。總收入來說，它可以帶給我一萬五。如果我有其他的…額外工作的話，會帶我更多的收入。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out specific details about the income amount and currency
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word for 'NT$50,000'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of 'NT$50,000' as '一萬五'

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
The next question is if you have your daughter’s custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and do not come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask is when you have the custody, but your wife also have the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, it will cut your daughter’s  ties with your wife. What’s your opinion about this point?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經待在台灣5年了。我有居留證，我也喜歡台灣。目前我並沒有離開台灣的打算，特別我認為，我的小孩有權…應該要有機會能夠看到父母。我想要強調的是，雖然我和我的妻子正打算離婚，但是我並沒有打算切斷他們母女的關係。就算我們在打離婚官司的期間，我也會定期寄照片給我的妻子。我甚至安排家庭聚會的時間，讓她和我們的女兒跟我一起見面，培養感情。

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
Currently, you do not have the plan to go back, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不，我可能會回去，但這是因為我母親年事已高又已經生病了。但是即使我回去，我也不會待在那裏很久。更不會想要把女兒帶過去。

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now, I am going to ask the other part some questions. Don’t you live with your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'anymore' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'Don't you' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'live with your husband', resulting in incorrect word order.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have separated for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'separated' should agree with the plural subject 'we'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When do you …the case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
Before you have the divorce trial, you have already not live with your husband, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the husband in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'you' after the verb 'have' instead of before it.

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
Then, who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
 I live with my son which from my first marriage.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about living together with the son.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? Then, which is this marriage you with the plaintiff?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
Now，you are fighting the custody with your second husband and this child is a daughter.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker being the mother.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'you' at the beginning of the sentence instead of the end.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the present tense 'are' instead of the past tense 'were' to match the original text.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'husband' instead of 'second husband', which changes the meaning.

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
Then how old is you son? And how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight-month …year old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'daughter'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, does your daughter live with you or with your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter's living arrangement.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'does' instead of 'did'.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because when I moved out, my daughter was just two- month old, she needed my care , so she was with me.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the daughter was with the speaker.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
And now, who does your daughter live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter live with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Now my daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you have some agreements with your husband? Why does your daughter fist live with you, but with your husband later?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The house I moved into is smaller than the house I lived with my husband. So take the environment into consideration, I think our previous house is better for my daughter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So, in the objective circumstance, which means the living environmental, if the house is the same as yours, you will live with your daughter, is that right? So why do you want to have the custody of your daughter?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I spend ten months bearing…to…, how could I live without her. And my husband is a Canadian, and he does not have regular income, he might have the possibility to go back to Canada any time. If that happens, I would not see my daughter anymore, that’s the reason why I wan to my daughter’s custody.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Please describe detailedly about how will you raise your child, concider your financial status.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific request to explain how they will bear the cost of raising their daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'detailedly' in the wrong position in the sentence.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we are having the divorce case. I want to ask the court to sentence the house, which I lived with my husband before for me. So thinking about the environment, the house is a good place for my children to grow up. As for my financial status, I have already provided my own asset list to the court; otherwise, I also have a regular income, which is probably 40000(forty thousand) a month. I think I have the capability of taking good care of my daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce trial? Do you know when do the divorce case end?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'going' before 'on' in the first sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'do' before 'the divorce case end' instead of after.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure, we will have the court on this Friday. I will say to the judge of our divorce case that I wan to end the case as soon as possible.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, the court will send social worker to visit both of your houses, and evaluate how is your daughter’s relation with each of you. The court will take those two factors into consider, and consider who will give the daughter the best …condition. Before we give the custody, do you have the willingness to have shared custody? The shared custody means the child live with the parent …live with the father for a while, and live with the mother for a while.

grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'condition' instead of 'care'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
就我個人的意見的話，我不贊同共同撫養，因為我的女兒還太小，她只有八個月大。我不想她不能適應我跟妻子之間的變動。對一個這麼小的小孩來說，跟父親或母親只住在一起一段時間會造成她的混淆。

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
In this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small, she is not …the shared custody is not good for her.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So, we just arrange the social worker first. After they have their reports, we will set another court date. At that time, both of you will have the chances to state your opinions.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the social worker's visit and the purpose of the court date.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
我對社工探訪的這件事沒意見
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of being 'fine' with the social workers' visits.

沒有問題，謝謝。

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我認為應該要將全部的撫養權判都給我,因為我真的非常關心他,我有兩個原因,第一是因為我的妻子根本沒有跟我們住在一起,我想跟我的女兒一起長大,而且我聽說我的前妻現在跟別的男人同居,如果事實真的是這樣的話,我很懷疑他是否能夠給我女兒一個很好的成長環境,因此我希望我能擁有全部的撫養權

You mention that you have several part time job. Because they are part time job, can you promise you have the regular income?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.

The other question I want to ask you is if you get the child rearing right, would you bring you daughter to Canada and would not come back Taiwan? I want to ask this question is even if you get the child rearing right, you wife still have the visitation right. If you bring you daughter to your country, on other hand to say that you are separated them. For this case, do you have any explanation?

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean that you don’t have plan to back your country.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'anytime' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。

是的。

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。

他是我第二任先生。

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you live outer, did your daughter live with you or your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。

那現在孩子在誰那裏？

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is with my husband.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the current situation of the daughter being with the husband.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'lived' before the subject 'your daughter' instead of using the correct word order.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '原來' as 'because' instead of 'originally', resulting in a different meaning.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The house I live now is smaller and the previous one is my husband’s house is much bigger. For environment, my daughter live with my husband is the best choice.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'the previous one is my husband’s house is much bigger'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'my daughter live with my husband is the best choice' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the speaker giving custody of the child to the husband.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
The objective circumstance, I mean the living environment does not change, does your daughter live with your husband is better than you. So why do you want to fight for the child rearing right?

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I have pregnant for ten moths, I can’t live without her. She is my baby. Moreover, I husband is Canadian, he is probably go back to Canada anytime, in that case, I can’t see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I want to right for my daughter’s custody.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
According to your financial status, can you explain what will you going to do to care with your daughter?

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we are in divorce case, I want to fight for the living right in currently my husband lived house. According to the environment that house is the vest choice for my daughter. About my financial status, I had provided my asset list to the court. Furthermore, I have fixed income. I have 40000 NT dollars every month.

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'going' before 'on' in the first sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'precise' in the wrong position in the second sentence.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. This Friday we have to go to the court again. I want to state to the court that I want the decision comes out quickly.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Ok I will arrange the social workers to both parties’ house. And they will make the evaluation of the living situation of you both with your daughter. The court will make the decision concerning the social workers’ evaluation. But before that circumstance, I want ask you both, do you consider the shared custody. It means the living time will change from time to time with you both. Rather. It means the daughter will live with the husband some time and other time will live with the wife.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
目前我並沒有這個打算,因為我覺得我女兒還太小了,她只有八個月大,我不想它異質精力這種在父母親之間的改變,對這麼小的小孩來說它是沒有辦法適應必須一下子跟這個至親在一起一下子跟那個親人在一起

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
Upon this point, I have the same idea with mu husband. My daughter is too young to suit the shared custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Ok, so at first I will arrange the social workers‘ visitation. After their report comes out, I will arrange the other court. And in this court, you both have the time to explain.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
是的,我對社工的考察沒有意見

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
So first I want to ask the plaintiff a few questions. Please tell me why do you want the sole custody of your children? As my un…for my understanding, you don’t have a… you don’t have a full time job or regular income I n Taiwan. Also, you are a fore…fore…foreigner. So, in this case, why you think you are more suitable for this… for the children…for the child rearing?

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望擁有我兩個女兒的全部扶養權，有兩個原因。首先，我太太已經不和我們一起住了。我希望能看著我女兒成長。恩…再者，我聽說我太太目前正在和別的男人同居。如果真的是這樣子的話，我很懷疑她是不是能夠讓我小孩擁有…得到應有的照顧。這就是為什麼我希望可以擁有全部扶養權。

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean…um…even you and your wife are still in the case…in the divorce, that she’s no longer live with you? And you also doubt that she lives with the other…another man? So base on such situation, so you are not willing to give your child…your daughter to her. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original meaning

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，就是這樣。這是我最主要的考量。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Otherwise, to consider your… in the consideration of your financial status, if you do have the sole custody, so how do you going to raise your child…your daughters?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實是沒有全職的工作。但是我目前有幾份的打工，讓我有固定的收入。我相信這些收入足夠扶養我自己和我的女兒們。

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
So you just mention that you have several part-time jobs. So because they are part-times, can you give the basic…basic estivation… estitation that you can… how much money you can have each month?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
So my another concern is that err if you have… if you have the custody, will you bring the daughters back to Canada and never come back? And why I ask this question is that even if you have the custody, your wife still might have the visitation right. So if you bring your daughters back to your country, then… in another way, it’s a kind way… it’s a kind of way of… cut the tie with your…cut the tie between your wife and daughters. So on this point, what’s your appoint…opinion?

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslates '隔離她們母女見面' as 'cut the tie between your wife and daughters' instead of 'separate the mother and daughters' visits'.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待五年了，我有居留證，而且我喜歡這個地方，所以目前並沒有離開台灣的打算。尤其我覺得我的女兒有權利見到他的父親和母親。我想強調的是，雖然我和我太太正在打離婚官司，但我絕對並沒有想要把他們連結切斷的意思………並沒有把我太太和小孩的連結切斷的意思。即使在我們打官司的過程中，我還是會固定傳我女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至還安排了一些時間就是讓她…來和我們女兒一起團聚。

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
恩…並不是，因為我可能會回去加拿大。因為我母親已經老了，而且她還生病。但即使我回去加拿大，我也不會待非常久的時間。我甚至可能不會考慮帶我女兒一起回去。

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far, we’re still seeking the divorce case. So I to fight for the right to live with the house my husband is live with…is live in. So base on that environment, I think the house will be a… will be a right place… will be a good place for raising my child. And my… talking about my financial status, I’ve already offer the court one of my asset list. Otherwise, I have a regular job, so my total income each month is average forty thousands. So I think I’m totally capable of raising my child… raising my children.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
May I ask your… your divorce case is in what progress? Is in what process? Is there any… any date that you are… you can expect that the judgment will… will come out?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. We have go to the court this Friday. I want ask the judge on Friday… um our judgment will come out as soon as possible.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, now, the court will arrange the social… a social worker to pay a visit to the plaintiff and the… to the husband and wife. And will make a evaluation about your… about your dealing…about your dealing situation between the father…between…um… between the parents and the children. And the court will make the judgment based on their evaluations and find out… find out what is the best situation for the children. Before that I have to ask, is shared-custody in your consideration? I mean the both side… The so-called shared-custody is means the children will live with both side and both a little… a little… um… with the father a period of time, and the other… and the mother a period of time.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不喜歡這樣的安排，因為我女兒還太小了。她才八個月大欸。我不想要她在我和我太太之間不斷來回。對於這麼小的孩子來說，這未免也太混亂了吧，要和其中…其中…要和雙親其中一方待一陣子，然後有和另外一方待一陣子。

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this point, I agree with my husband. My… our daughter is still too young for… is too young… for this solution.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
So in this case, so we might…err…so we are… so for now, we are going to into the procedure for the social worker’s evaluation. After evaluation came…come out, then we will arrange another court. Let the both side have the chance to their statements. Is that ok with you?

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I will inquire the plaintiff. Plaintiff, why do you want the custody to be granted to you? As I known, you don’t have a full time job in Taiwan, and also you are a foreigner. So why do you think you are …more capable?

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我想要爭取小孩的監護權有個原因:第一我太太不再在跟我住，我想要看我小孩長大，而且我聽聞我太太跟一個男人同居，如果這是真的話，我懷疑她能給我女兒她應得的照顧，因此我希望擁有我女兒的扶養權
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the word 'sole' before 'custody'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence '我想要爭取小孩的監護權有個原因'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	used '扶養權' instead of '監護權'

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that you.. and your wife are still in the divorce case but she no longer live with you and also doubted her of living with another man. Is this the reason that you refuse… refuse to give the daughter … be taking care of.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the children in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'refuse' after 'the daughter' instead of before.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'refuse' instead of 'not willing' to convey the meaning of not wanting to give the children to the wife.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對這是我主要的考慮

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has errors in word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses incorrect words that do not convey the intended meaning.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
As for your financial status, if you are granted for the sole custody, how are you going to take care of her?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有全職的工作是真的，但是我有幾份兼差，有穩定收入，我相信這幾筆收入能足夠讓我照顧我自己跟女兒
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have a few part jobs. Because that are just part-time jobs. Can you … can you approximately count what income could you have each month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有4到5個兼差，總共來說一個會有5萬多，有時候或許我有新案子，收入會更多
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out specific details about the part-time jobs and the income

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another question I would like to ask, if you are granted with the custody of your daughter. Will you back to Canada and you won’t come back? The reason I am asking this question is …. Even though you are granted with the custody of your daughter, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to your country, it will …. It will cut the lie.. between the daughter and mom. As for this point, what do you have to say?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'cut the lie' instead of 'cut the tie'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of 'cut the tie'

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年，我有居留證，我也喜歡台灣，目前我沒有計畫離開台灣，而且我相信我女兒應該要有機會看到爸爸媽媽，我想強調的是雖然我和我太太目前正在打離婚官司但我並沒有想要切斷女兒和媽媽的聯繫，在我們整個離婚官司的時候，我不時會傳些我女兒的照片給我太太，甚至還安排ㄧ些外出讓她能跟我們一起度過ㄧ些時光

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean …. Recently you don’t have a plan to go back to your country, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不 我可能會回加拿大，因為我母親年紀大了又生病，但如果我回去的話，我也不會待很久，我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒回去
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I am going to ask some questions of the other party. Do you …. You don’t live t with your husband, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes we have been separated for 6 months.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' at the beginning of the sentence.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Around 2 months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
You mean before file the divorce case, you had not live with your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

是的。
yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So can you tell me who you are living with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
 I am now living with my son which from the first marriage
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So what is the marriage you and the plaintiff?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the number of marriages the defendant has had.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the custody we are going to .. you are going to ask for is the child you had with your second husband? And she is a girl?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'fighting' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'you' after the verb 'are going to ask for' instead of before it.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'you are going to ask for' instead of 'we are going to ask for' to maintain subject-verb agreement.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The user used 'you' instead of 'we' to refer to the speaker and the person they are speaking to.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a question mark at the end of the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'the custody we are going to ask for' instead of 'the custody we are fighting for'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '第二任先生' which means 'second husband'.

對。
yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? How old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is 7 years old and my daughter is 8 months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you move out, the daughter goes with you or stays with your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the husband in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the order of the subject and verb in the question.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because when the time I move out, my daughter was only 2 months, she is so little and she needs me, so I brought he
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the daughter is still in need of care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So who lives with the child?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'now' which is present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation changes the word order of the sentence.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter lives with my husband
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the daughter is currently with the husband.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you and the plaintiff have found an agreement? Why the daughter was with you but now she lives with your husband.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
 The place I moved out was little.. Littler than the house my husband was living.. for the environmental concern I give my daughter to my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'The place I moved out was little' should be 'The place I moved out of was little'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Littler than the house my husband was living' should be 'Smaller than the house my husband was living in'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence 'for the environmental concern I give my daughter to my husband' should be 'for the sake of the environment, I entrusted my daughter to my husband'.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstance did not change, your living environment is not good for your daughter, right? Why do you want to ask for the custody of your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why do you want to ask for custody of your daughter?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '子女撫養權' as 'custody' is incorrect. It should be translated as 'child custody' or 'custody of the child'.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter who I spent ten months in pregnant. How could I bear not to see her? My husband is from husband Canada and his job in Taiwan is not stable. He may go back to Canada anytime, if that is the case, I could not see my daughter anymore, therefore I would like to as for the custody for my daughter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'spent ten months in pregnant'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in 'husband is from husband Canada'
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect tense in 'he may go back to Canada anytime'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	incorrect word choice in 'as for the custody for my daughter'

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your financial status, could you tell how are you going to raise your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are now still in the divorce case. I hope to ask for the hose which my husband lives now. So … as the surroundings around for the house, it will be good for my daughter. As for my financial status, I had already shown an asset list to the court. Besides, I also have a stable job; the payment which I could get every month is above 40000 Dollars. I think I am capable in both ways to raise my daughter.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。

Ok.. So.. The court will arrange social workers to visit both of your houses. And also the social workers will make the evaluation of the situation you and the plaintiff have with your child. The court will take the results into consideration and consider what is best for the child. Before that, I would like to ask both of you, do you like to have shared custody. The shared custody I mean here is the daughter will spend some time with the father and some time with the mother.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不喜歡這個安排，因為我女兒還太小，她只有八個月，我不想要她一直在我和我太太間送來送去，對一個只有八個月的小孩來說，她可能會產生困惑，有些時間和爸爸在一起有些時間和媽媽

At this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small. The arrangement should not .. could not be arranges as shared custody.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today our case is the child rearing case between Ferry Johnson and Tsai-Yung Shu. Have you all… Have you both appointed lawyers?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我有委託律師。
Yes, I have.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有…一名律師。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'lawyer' in the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today for our preparatory case, my main goal today is to understand your main positions in the case. I would also like to know the reason why both of you believe you are more fitting to take care of the child. Could you please emphasize your views on this later on. Besides, I am also aware that you are in the court for divorce at the moment. So I would not like to hear any verbal attack between the two parties, do you understand?

I understand.
我了解。

了解。
I understand.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Ok, first I would like to ask: Why do you want… the right to take care of your child. As far as I know, you do not have an official job in Taipei. You are also a foreigner. Why do you believe you are a more suitable person for custody?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'to fight for' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the question.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭取' as 'to take care of' instead of 'to fight for'.
cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	The user added the phrase 'Ok, first I would like to ask' which is not present in the original text.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望擁有我女兒的全部扶養權，因為兩個原因。首先，我老婆並沒有汗我住在一起。我想要看著我的女兒長大。另外我還有聽到我的老婆漢另外一個男人同住。如果這屬實，我深切地懷疑她是否適合照顧我們的女兒，於是我希望取得全部扶養權。
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted critical context of wife no longer living with them
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我老婆並沒有汗我住在一起'
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	incorrect use of pronoun '汗' instead of '和' in '我老婆並沒有汗我住在一起'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	incorrect translation of 'sole custody' as '全部扶養權' instead of '獨自監護權'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	mismatched meaning in '我想要看著我的女兒長大' as it implies physically watching the daughter grow up instead of being there for her
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	neglected to translate 'best care she deserves'

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
What you mean is…while your wife has filed a divorce case with you, she is not living with you at the moment. And you have doubts about whether she is living with another man. And therefore, you are not willing to let your wife take care of your children, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the ongoing divorce case.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the wife is no longer living with the speaker.
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	The user added unnecessary words like 'And' at the beginning of each sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user did not follow the correct word order in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這是我主要的顧慮。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Next is about your financial status, and that means, if you receive custody of your child, how will you deal with the money?

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我的確沒有一個全職的工作，但我有幾個兼職的工作，所以…我是有收入的。我認為這些收入是夠照顧我自己與女兒的。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned you have many part time jobs. Because they are not fixed, can you estimate your fixed income for each month?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有四到五個…五份兼任的工作。加起來的話，大概會有一個月一萬五的收入。通常，如果我有新的專案的話，我就會有更多收入。
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of part-time jobs
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of NT$50,000 per month
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of new projects

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Next, I would like to ask you: If you received custody of your child, is it possible that you will bring your child to Canada, and never come back? My reason for asking this is even though you receive custody, your wife still has a visitation right. If you bring your child back to your country, it will equal…your preventing your wife from seeing the child. What do you have to say about this?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '隔離' (isolation) as 'preventing'

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了，我有居留證我也喜歡這個地方。至今我還沒有任核計劃要離開。尤其是我覺得…我女兒應該有見到她父母的權利。我想要強調的是：即使我和我老婆正在進行離婚程序，但我並不想要阻絕我老婆和我女兒…相見的機會。我們在辦離婚手續的這段期間，我都會固定送女兒的照片給老婆看。我也會計劃一些戶外的活動…讓女兒和老婆見面。

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean in the short term, you have no plans to go back to your country.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不是，我可能會回到加拿大，因為我媽媽年紀大了，也生病了。但即便我回去，也不會待太久。我甚至完全不會考慮將我女兒一起帶回去。

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
OK, now I’d like to ask the other party. So, you are not living with your husband anymore?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'husband' in the translation.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we’ve been separated for six months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case for divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So you’ve been separated even before you filed a lawsuit for divorce.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So may I ask your living situation? What I mean is, who are you living with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I’m living with my son from my first marriage.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the son being from the first marriage.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? So, the marriage between you and the….defendant…which…
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	rearranging the sentence structure

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the custody that you both are seeking…. is for your second child, your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversed word order in the question

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? And how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, did your daughter stay with the father or with you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'father' and 'you' in the translation.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I moved out, the child was only six months old and needed me to take care of her, so she went with me.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific age of the child (2 months old) and replaced it with a different age (six months old).

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
And who is the child with at this moment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now the child is with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Now my daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Have you reached any sort of agreement? Why was the daughter with you at the first point, and now with… the husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
My accommodation when I moved out is smaller than before. Considering the environment…the living environment, the old house was better, so I sent my daughter back.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'daughter' instead of 'children'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	using 'sent back' instead of 'entrusted to'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So if the objective circumstances, or the living environment has changed, it’s not good for your daughter either, isn’t it? Then why would you want to fight for your child’s custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I bore her for ten months! How could I even consider leaving her? Besides, my husband is a Canadian citizen. He doesn’t even have a stable job. If so, I might never see my daughter again. So I wish to… to receive custody for my child.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Concerning your financial status, can you elaborate…more about how you will take care of your daughter?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the financial aspect of taking care of the daughter.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are still in the middle of our divorce case. I wish to receive the house that my husband is living in right now. That would be a better environment for my daughter to grow up in. And about my financial status, I provided the court with my asset list. I also have a fixed job. I earn 40 thousand dollars each month. Or more. I think I’m capable of taking care of my daughter.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the ongoing divorce case.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing the court with her asset list.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of her husband's consent or agreement to live in the house after the divorce.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of her husband's financial status or ability to provide for their daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce case going? Have you estimated what time the courts decision will come out?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of a specific time frame.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. We will come to court again this Friday. I wish to tell the judge of the divorce case that I would like to see the results of the divorce case come out sooner.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	incorporating superfluous words or phrases

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
How about this, the court will send a social worker to visit both parties. Then they will evaluate the situation of both parties to see if they are fit to take care of the child. The report will be considered by the court to make the decision. But prior to that, I would like to ask if you consider…a shared custody? Shared custody entails that the child for a period of time stays with the father, and another period stays with the mother.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the order of 'both parties' and 'social worker'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrectly translating '共同持有撫養權' as 'shared custody'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人比較不偏好這個選擇，因為我的女兒年紀還太小。她只有八個月大。不希望她承受…這樣子的變化。對一個年紀這麼小的孩子來說，她會感到太困惑了，如果她有一段時間與一個人同住，然後另一段時間又搬去另一個地方。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young. It is not suitable to…for shared custody.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
OK, after that, let’s consider the social worker…visit. After they have devised a report, we will plan a date to come to court to give both of you an opportunity to elaborate on your decisions.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of the social worker's visit.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'visit' after 'social worker' instead of before.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after 'OK' and before 'after that'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '庭期' as 'date to come to court' instead of 'court date'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '陳述意見' which means 'present their opinions'.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好，沒問題。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of social workers' visits.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no problem with the decision either, thank you.

Today, the judge here wants to know more about the perspective of each party about child rearing. The judge also wants to know why both of you consider yourselves the most appropriate one to rear this child, so please elaborate this point, do you understand? In addition, I know that both of you are trying to get a divorce. Therefore, I do not wish to see that both of you have a verbal attack against each other. Do you understand?

Okay.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Okay now, I have some questions to ask the plaintiff. Please tell me the reasons why you wish to rear your child. According the information I’ve received, you do not have a full-time job in Taiwan, and you’re a foreigner, so why do you consider yourself the most appropriate person to have child custody?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'I know' in the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'according to the information I've received' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'tell'.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
現在有兩個原因去支持為什麼我比較適任於擁有子女撫養權。首先，我已經沒有和太太住在一起了，我想看著孩子長大。而且我還聽說我的太太和別的男人住在一起了。若是這樣的話，她應該不會給予我女兒真正應得的關愛。因此，我適任得到全部的撫養權。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
So do you mean that now, you’re preparing for a divorce, and your wife is no longer living with you, and you suspect her of living with another guy. Due to the situation like this, you do not wish to let her take care of the child, is that so?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是啊，這就是我主要的原因。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
Okay, then if…umm..according to your financial status, and if you really do receive the sole custody, then how are you planning to take care of the child?

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實沒有全職工作。但是，我好幾個間質的工作，因此，我有固定的收入。這些收入足以養活我自己和我的女兒。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'several' before 'part-time jobs' in the translation.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You’ve just mentioned about that you have several part-time jobs. Due to they are part-time jobs in their nature, can you tell me an estimated income per month?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
平均來說，我有四到五份兼職工作。總共來說，我每個月會賺進五萬台幣。若我有找到其他工作的話，我的收入會高於五萬。

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another question that I would like to ask you is once you receive the child custody, is it possible that you would just take the child to Canada and never come back? The reason why I asked you this is that even of you receive the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. So if you do this, if you just take the child to Canada with you, then it means that you just cut the ties between your daughter and your wife. So, according to this problem, what would you like to say?

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待了五年了吧。我有居留證號碼，而且我喜歡這個地方。目前為止，我是沒有要離開台灣的打算。而且我有認為我女兒應該要擁有見雙方父母的權利。縱使我和我太太目前正辦理離婚，但是，我不打算要切斷她們之間的關係。在我們辦理離婚手續的過程當中，我常常會將我女兒的照片給我太太看。我甚至會辦一些活動啊，或是約。。。我們大家一起出去。

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
 Okay, so you mean that currently, you do not have any plans to return to your mother country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
恩，不不不，我是有可能回加拿大，因為我母親現在生病啦。但縱使我回去加拿大，我也不會長期待在那裡。我應該也不會想要把我女兒帶那裡。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'consider' in the sentence 'I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '不不不' (no, no, no) at the beginning of the sentence, which is not necessary and disrupts the natural word order.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the future tense '我應該也不會想要' (I should also not want) instead of the conditional tense '我也不會想要' (I wouldn't want) in the sentence 'I wouldn’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.'

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay, now, I would like to ask the other party some questions. Are you still living with your husband or not?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Well, we’re not living together anymore for six months.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you ask for a divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About a month ago, I think.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'two' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the original text.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
Okay, that means before you asked for a divorce, you two have not been living together, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

是的。
Yes, that’s right.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So, who are you living with now? What’s the condition now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with the former husband’s son.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'I live with the son of my former husband.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Oh, your former husband….first marriage? Then, how about the husband you have now?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the number of the current husband's marriage.

他是我第二任先生。
Well, he’s my second husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'He is my second husband.'

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
Now, we’re trying to figure out the custody is about the child you have with your second husband. She’s a daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

對。
Yes, that’s right.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
Then how old is your son, and how old is your daughter?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question marks at the end of each sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order in the second sentence.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter eight months old.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.'
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after 'old' in the user's translation.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
The time when you moved out, your daughter, who did she go with?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is 'you'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'your daughter' before the verb 'did she go with', which is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Who did your daughter go with?'

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
At that time, my daughter was only two months old; therefore, she needs my care, so she stayed with me.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that they moved out.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'needs' instead of 'needed' to match the past tense of the sentence.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
And now, who is she staying with?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'children' from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now, she’s staying with my husband.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Did you have any pact between each other? Why does your daughter stayed with you, and then, she’s staying with your husband now?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place where I moved out to live is a bit small, and the place where my husband lives is quite large. Therefore, due to the environment and circumstances, I just wished my daughter to live with him.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
Okay, so if the objective circumstances do not change, then is your place still not better than your husband’s? Then why did you wish to receive the child’s sole custody?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	changed the meaning of '對你女兒仍然比較不好' to 'your place still not better than your husband’s'

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
Hey, I am the one who bear her for ten months, I can’t live without her. Moreover, my husband is a Canadian, he does not have a fixed income, and he even has the possibility to return to Canada. If so, then I’ll lose the right to visit my daughter. Therefore, I’m here to gain for the custody.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
In terms of your financial status, can you describe how you would raise the child?

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we’re still trying to divorce, and I would like to get the right of living in the place where my husband is now living. Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it would be perfect for my daughter to grow up. As for my current financial status, I have let the court see my asset list. Moreover, I have a very regular income and a very stable job. My monthly income would be no less than forty thousand. Therefore, I believe that I have the ability to take care of my daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
Okay, so how is your divorce case going on? Do you know why you will get the verdict, approximately when?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'now' in the question, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'why' in the wrong position in the sentence.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not use a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
Well, I’m not sure. We’ll go to the court this Friday again. I would like to ask the court to make a decision of the verdict sooner.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
 The court will ask social workers to visit the home of both parties and make an evaluation of each of your ways of taking care of the child. And the court will decide according their report of how you take care of the child. Before this, I would like to ask both parties do you mind of having a shared custody? Shared custody means that the child can stay with her father for a while, and stay with her mother for another while
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the court's involvement in arranging the visit of social workers and the evaluation of the parties' interaction with the child.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the crucial information that the court will consider the social workers' report in determining the best arrangement for the child.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'of how you take care of the child' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'according to their report'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'do you mind' instead of 'will you consider' when asking about shared custody.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
恩，我不太想要耶，因為我女兒還小。她才八個月大。我不想要她一下子陪我，然後一下子又陪我太太。如果是這樣的狀況的話，我的女兒她這麼小，她會覺得很混亂。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree with my husband’s point. My daughter is too young; therefore, shared custody is not the right choice for us.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay, if so, then we’ll just begin our progress of sending the social workers. And after receiving their report, we’ll set up a time to open the court again. Therefore, you two will have the chance of making a statement, okay?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after 'And'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'progress' does not accurately convey the meaning of '安排' (arrange).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'open the court again' does not accurately convey the meaning of '安排庭期' (schedule a court date).
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The phrase '陳述意見' (make a statement) is not translated.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
恩，好的，社工人員可以來我家。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of being fine with the visits of social workers.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no problem with that, either, thank you.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today, we are here for the preparation procedure of the child rearing between these two parties. Do both parties hire a lawyer?

我有委託律師。
Yes, I have hired a lawyer.

我也有。

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today, the court is to understand the position for these two people in terms of the child rearing. Besides, the court also hopes to know whether you two have the capacity to rear the child. Please elaborate in terms of this point. Besides, we know that you also have the case of divorce about this case. Therefore, we hope that you two will not have verbal attacks with one another and have a quarrel.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, the plaintiff, please, why do you want to have the right to rear your child? As the court investigates, you don’t have a formal job in Taiwan. You haven’t had a formal job in Taiwan yet. Beside, you are a foreigner. Why do you think that you have the capacity to take care of your child?

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望法院可以判給我全部撫養權，因為兩個原因。首先，我妻子不再跟我一起生活了。我想在這邊看我女兒長大。此外，我還聽說我妻子還跟另外一個男人共處。如果那是真的的話，我就懷疑她是否能撫養我們的女兒。所以我想要有全部的撫養權。

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that your wife is not under the same roof with you, and you are dealing with the case about divorce. Besides, you are also suspicious about whether she stays with a other man. Is this the very reason for you to have the sole custody?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect word choice

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是，這是我的主要原因。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
About your financial status, if you get the sole custody of your daughter, how do you rear your daughter?

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在沒有全職的工作。但是我有許多兼職的工作，讓我有固定的收入。我覺得這些收入已經足夠養活我和我的女兒了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'several' before 'part-time jobs' in the translation.

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just mentioned that you have some part-time job. Because these jobs are not formal, do you have the whole overview of your regular income? Whether it is fixed?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均有4到5個兼職工作。大約可以讓我賺5萬塊吧。如果我有其他案子的話，收入會更多。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Besides, the court would like to ask another question. Do you plan to bring her back to Canada and do not return to Taiwan after you have the sole custody? The reason for asking this question is that your wife may still have the visitation right after you have the sole custody. If you bring your daughter back to your country, it may evolve into a situation that you cut the tie between your wife and your daughter. About this point, what do you want to say?

我在台灣已經待了5年了。我己經有了居留證號碼，也喜歡這個地方。我沒有任何離開台灣的打算。我認為，其實女兒有可以看我們雙親的權利。我想要強調一點，雖然我們現在打離婚官司，但我沒有要切斷他們兩個聯繫的意圖。在我們打離婚官司的時候，我還寄了不少我女兒的照片給老婆呢。我甚至安排時間能讓我和女兒、還有我的太太一起出遊呢。

You mean that recently, you don’t have the plan to return to your country.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
其實我也可能會回加拿大，因為我媽媽很老、很虛弱。如果我回國，也不會待太久，甚至不考慮把我女兒一起拜去加拿大。

That is to say, before you file the divorce case, you two have not lived together. Is that true?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So, how is your living situation? I mean that who accompanies you, live with you.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son with my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
Your first marriage? What is the time of marriage with the plaintiff?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'plaintiff' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'plaintiff' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'marriage'.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
Therefore, you are seeking to the custody of your daughter, who you have with the second husband.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the ongoing dispute over child custody.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'seeking to the custody' instead of 'seeking custody'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'who you have with the second husband' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'your daughter'.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son with your first marriage?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is 7 years old, and my daughter is about 8 months.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
After you move away from your house, you bring your daughter with you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
Because at that time, my daughter was only 2 months, she still needed my support.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker moved out.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
My daughter is living with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'My daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you two have any agreements with each other because firstly, she lives with you, and now she lives with your husband?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'with each other' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'agreements'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '原來女兒' as 'she' instead of 'daughter'.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The house I’m living after moving out is smaller than the one that I stayed with my husband. In terms of the environment, I think it is better to stay in the original house with my husband.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstance about your house is not better than your husband’s house, it is not good for your daughter, isn’t it? Why do you want to have the right to rear your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I had been pregnant about 10 months for the daughter. How can I just give my daughter to my husband? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian. He don’t have regular jobs and formal jobs, I’m afraid that he will go back to Canada. If that is true, I will not see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I would like to strike to have the right to rear my daughter.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your financial status, please elaborate how you will take care of your daughter in the future.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are still dealing with the case of our divorce. Now, I’m seeking to win, to have the right to live in the original house, which now my husband is living. Therefore, in terms of the living conditions and environment, the original house is better for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have provided a asset list for my income. Besides, I have a formal job in Taiwan, and the regular payment is 40,000 NT dollars. I think that I have the capacity to take care of my daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce case now? Do you have the idea about the exact time to close your divorce case?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'going' before 'to close' in the second sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'exact' before 'time' instead of after it.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure. This Friday, we will attend the court about my marriage. I hope that I will ask the court to have their decision faster and earlier.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'ask' is not appropriate in this context.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
Okay, the court will arrange social workers to visit you two, and these social workers will evaluate in terms of the circumstances about rearing your daughter. We will make further decision in terms of their observation. However, before that, can have shared custody? Shared custody is that your daughter will stay with your husband a whole and later will spend some time with the mother.

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'observation' instead of 'evaluation'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人認為，我不太想要共同扶養權，我女兒還很小，只有8個月大，我不希望她在我跟太太之間送來送去的。對一個只有8個月的小孩來說，一下子跟我住，一下子又跟她媽媽住的話，會讓她十分困擾。

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
About this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is still too young. It is not appropriate for her to live with the shared custody.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Therefore, the court will first arrange social workers to visit with you two parties. After their report and observation, we will further set a court day. Therefore, on that day, you can elaborate further about this case.

In today’s preparatory procedure, I am going to know the position of both of you. I also want to know why both of you think that you can have the sole custody. Please elaborate for this point.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Plantiff, why do you strive for the child’s sole custody? As far as I am concerned, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan. You are a foreigner. Why do you think that you have the right to have the child’s sole custody.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff's current job status and foreigner status.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'plaintiff' after the question, which is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭取子女撫養權' as 'the child's sole custody' instead of 'striving for the child's custody rights'.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
因為以下兩點，所以我想爭取孩子的獨立撫養權第一，我的妻子沒跟我同住，我想看我女兒長大，更何況我聽說我妻子跟另外一個男人住，如果這是真的，我很懷疑她是否能給我們女兒最好的照顧，因此能擁有獨立的撫養權
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'granted' in 'I hope to be granted with the sole custody'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '因為以下兩點，所以我想爭取孩子的獨立撫養權'

omission or addition	leaving out critical context	omitted 'because of two concerns' in '因為以下兩點'
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	omitted 'the best care she deserves' in '給我們女兒最好的照顧'

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean that your wife has no longer lived with you, even if you two are still under the divorce procedure? Moreover, you also suspend she is now living with another man? It is because this situation therefore you do not want to give her the custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'You mean that your wife has no longer lived with you'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'even if you two are still under the divorce procedure'

omission or addition	omission of details	Omission of the phrase 'to give her the custody' in the sentence 'It is because this situation therefore you do not want to give her the custody?'

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這是我的主要考量

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
How do you plan to take care of your daughter according to your financial status?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of financial status in the translation.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a question mark at the end of the sentence.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我目前的確沒有全職工作，但我有好幾份兼職，也有穩定的收入，我想這收入足夠我養活我的女兒和自己
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because what you did is still the part-time jobs, can you evaluate how much do you earn per month regularly?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the nature of the part-time jobs being discussed.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'did' before the subject 'what', resulting in incorrect word order.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
 我平均來說有四五份兼職，總計大概有五萬台幣，有時如果找到新的兼職，我可能還會有額外的收入
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'per month' in the translation.

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I want to ask that if you get your daughter’s sole custody, will you go back to Canada and never come back to Taiwan again? The reason why I ask this question is that if you get the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, the situation will be that you separate your daughter with her mom. As for this, what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣待了五年了，也有了居留證，而我也很喜歡這裡，目前為止我沒有打算離開台灣，另外，我也覺得我女兒有權利見到父母雙方，我想要強調，儘管我跟我太太正在打離婚官司，但我並不想切斷我女兒的聯繫，在我們打離婚官司的過程中，我也好幾次發我女兒的照片給我太太，我甚至邀請她和我女兒一起出遊
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the ARC (Alien Resident Certificate) in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '也有了居留證' (also obtained the ARC) before the mention of staying in Taiwan for five years, which changes the chronological order of events.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'cutting the tie' as '切斷聯繫' (cut off contact) instead of '切斷關係' (cut off the relationship).
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate 'ARC' (Alien Resident Certificate) in the text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我也覺得我女兒有權利見到父母雙方' (I also think my daughter has the right to see both parents) before the mention of seeking a divorce, which changes the logical order of events.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean that you do not plan to go back to your hometown?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
是的，但我可能會回加拿大，因為我母親年老且生病了，但就算我回去，我也不會待太長時間，我甚至不考慮帶我女兒一起去
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect tense
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Okay, then I will ask the other side some questions. Now you do not live with your husband, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we live in different places for six months.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'live' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'we have lived' instead of 'we live'.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the case for divorce?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Maybe two months ago.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific action or event that was mentioned in the original text.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That is to say, before you two seek for divorce, you did not live your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
Then who do you live now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
 I live with my son in my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'I live with my son from my first marriage.'

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? How about the plantiff?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the plaintiff's marriage.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So you are now striving for the custody of your daughter with the second husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the first husband and the fact that the child is from the second marriage.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'are' instead of 'is' to agree with the singular subject 'daughter'.

對。
 Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son and your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is 7 years old and my daughter is 8 months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you moved out, who did your daughter live with?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
My daughter was with because she was only two months old then.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the user moving out and the need for the user's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
Who is your daughter living with now?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'daughter' in the translation.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is living with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Now my daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Do you two have an agreement? Why the daughter first with you and now with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Why is the daughter with you first and now with your husband?'

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
The place where I live now is much smaller than the house I lived with my husband before. Considering the environment, my husband’s house is better for my daughter.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
Therefore, in objective circumstances, your place is not good for your daughter, right? Then why do you want the custody of your daughter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is the one who I spent ten months to have, how can I live without her? My husband is a Canadian. Besides, his job is not stable. He might go back to Canada anytime. In that case, I cannot see my daughter again. So I want to have my daughter’s sole custody.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
In the terms of your financial status, can you explain how you are going to rear your daughter?

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
We are still under the divorce case. I wish the court can let me in my husband’s house. Therefore, as to the environment, that house will be good for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have given the court my current asset list. Besides, I have a regular job and on average, I have NT$40000 per month. Therefore, I am able to take care of my daughter.

I would like to ask that how’s your divorce case? When will the trial procedure be set?

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。

The court will send social workers to you and your husband’s houses, then evaluate the situation. The court will make the decision according to the social workers’ report.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人認為這並不適合，因為我女兒還太小，她只有八個月大，我不想她在我和老婆間換來換去，這對我小孩來說，這會造成我小孩的混亂，當他一下跟爸爸，一下跟媽媽的時候

At this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young to have the shared custody about rearing together.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific arrangement mentioned in the original text.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Okay, then we will first arrange for the social workers’ visit. After getting the report from the social workers, we will set the court date. Both of you have the right to state your opinions.

今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
Today we are here for preparatory procedure for Mr. Johnson and Ms.…. Both parties, do you have your lawyers?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

我有委託律師。
Yes, I do.

I also have a lawyer.
我也有
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'lawyer' from the translation.

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today the judge will want to know your positions of the child rearing. We also want to know why you think you are suitable for rearing this child. Please elaborate it according to this point. I know you are also in the divorce case. So we hope that you could avoid the verbal attack.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I would like to ask some questions for both of you. The plaintiff, why do you want to strive for the child rearing rights? As I know, you do not have full-time job in Taiwan. And your identity is foreigner. For this situation, why do you think you are more suitable?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase '告訴人' (the plaintiff) in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of the plaintiff not having a full-time job and being a foreigner, which is important in understanding why they believe they are suitable for child rearing rights.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect in the translation.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
考量這2個原因，我希望能將全部撫養權判給我。第一，我的妻子沒有跟我一起住了。我想要看到我小孩長大。此外，我也聽說我的太太現在跟另外一個男人一起住。如果是這樣的話，我很懷疑他能給小孩一個好的成長環境嗎？所以我希望我能擁有全部的撫養權。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using '判給' instead of '撫養權'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	using '全部的撫養權' instead of '獨自撫養權'

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
So you mean that your wife is in the divorce case with you, but she does not live with you now? And you doubt that she lives with other man. It is this situation that makes you unwilling to make your children taken care of by her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the husband's suspicion that his wife is living with another man.

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這就是我主要的考量緣故

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses incorrect words that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user's translation misinterprets cultural references or symbols present in the original text.

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
For your financial status concerns, if you get sole custody, how will you raise your daughter?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of financial status concerns.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
的確，我現在沒有全職工作，但是我現在有兼好幾份打工，足以付足…。我想這些收入足夠撫養我的女兒。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because they are all part-time jobs, could you evaluate how much regular income you will get?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我大概有4到5份的兼職工作。那這樣算起來的話，每個月我大概可以有5萬元的收入，此外我如果還有多一些工作的話，也許收入會增加。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
I have another question. If you have the custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and will not come back to Taiwan? I ask this is because that even if you get the custody, your wife still has the visitation rights. If you take your child back to your country, it means that you cut the tie between the mother and the daughter. What’s your idea about this?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the mention of the husband's wife having visitation rights.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user fails to mention that the husband is considering taking the child back to Canada.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待5年了，我有居留證號碼，而且我非常喜歡這個地方。目前為止，我沒有要離開台灣的打算。我也覺得我的小孩有需要見到父母。我要強調，雖然我跟我太太現在在打離婚官司，但我從來沒想過要切斷他與我女兒的聯繫。在打離婚官司的過程中，我有寄我女兒的照片給我太太，我還邀請…

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So you mean in the short term, you do not plan to go back to your country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
也許吧。因為我母親已經非常老而且生病了。即使我回去了，我也不會留太久。我也沒想過我要把女兒一起帶回去。

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now we want to ask the relative party about some questions. You do not live with your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'anymore' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'live' before the subject 'you', which is incorrect in English.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have not lived together for six months.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'have' should be in the present perfect tense to indicate an ongoing action.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
So when do you suit the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So before you suit the divorce case, you do not live together?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So who do you live with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son with my first marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So what’s the…
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the second part of the sentence, which asks about the number of marriages the person being referred to has had.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So about the child rearing rights, it’s about the daughter with your second husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the current dispute over child custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'with your second husband' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'daughter', resulting in a word order error.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son? And your daughter?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'How' in the translation.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old and my daughter is six months old.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the plural subject 'children'.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you move out, does your daughter live with you or your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the husband in the translation.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When I move out, my daughter was only two months old, and she needs me, so she lived with me then.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the daughter still needs the user's care.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So where did the daughter live with?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'now' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'with' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'live'.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter lives with my husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation changes the meaning of the original text.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there any agreement between your husband and you? Why does your daughter live with your husband instead of you?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	rearranging the sentence structure

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I move out, the place I live is smaller than the place that my husband lives. For living environment, it will be better for my child, so I let my daughter live with my husband.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '交給' as 'let' instead of 'entrust'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So if the objective circumstances, that is, the living environment, does not change, it’s still not good for your daughter, isn’t it? So why do you strive for the custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter, and I cannot see her. My husband is a Canadian, and his job in Taiwan is not so fixed, he may go back to Canada anytime. Then, in that case, I will not see my daughter forever. So I hope I can strive for the rearing rights for my daughter.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	incorporating superfluous words or phrases
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '懷胎十個月'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	failure to translate '撫養權'

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
For your financial status, how will you afford the raising…?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we are still in the divorce case. I hope I can strive for the rights that I can live in the house that my husband lives now. So for the living environment, that house will be good for my daughter. As for my financial status, I have offered my asset list for the court. Besides, I have the fixed job, that I can get NT$40000 per month. I believe I can raise and take care of my daughter.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the ongoing divorce case.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the financial support provided by the husband.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter's well-being.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the husband's agreement to the arrangement.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter's custody.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the husband's financial status.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the husband's ability to provide for the daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So how is your divorce case? When will the divorce case have the result?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'going' before 'to have the result'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'the' before 'divorce case' instead of after.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not so sure. We will be in court this Friday. I will express to the judge of the divorce case that the decision can be given as soon as possible.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
So the court will send the social workers to visit both of you, and will make the evaluation for how you interact with your daughter. We will make some decision according to the social workers’ report. Before that, I would like to ask will both of you consider the shared custody? Shared custody means that the daughter will live with the husband sometime and live with mother some time.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'make' instead of 'consider'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting 'shared custody' as living with each parent at different times

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我並不太贊成這個安排，因為我的女兒還太小，他只有8個月大，我不想讓他在我跟我太太之間傳來傳去的。對一個這麼小的小孩來說，如果讓他跟爸爸住一段時間，又讓他跟媽媽住一段時間，這樣會讓他感到非常混亂。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small, it is not suitable for this arrangement.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'on this point' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'I agree with my husband' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'On this point'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '共同撫養的安排方式' as 'this arrangement' instead of 'the arrangement of joint custody'.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Ok, we will go through the process of social workers’ visitation. After they do the report, we will set the next court date. Then we will make both of you have the opportunity to state.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the social workers' visitation process.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'Then we will make both of you have the opportunity to state' in an incorrect position in the sentence.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
好，我同意這個安排。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'social workers' in their translation.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I also agree, too.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
Let me ask you a few question. Plaintiff, why do you want to get the sole custody of your child? Far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan for the time being. And you’re also a foreigner. In fighting for the child rearing right, why do you think you’re more capable?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'Let me ask you a few question.'

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'sole custody' instead of 'child custody' which changes the meaning.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我希望能得到我女兒的全部撫養權, 而我有兩個理由. 首先我太太已經沒和我們住在一起了, 我希望能陪伴我女兒成長. 再來我聽說我老婆和另一個男的同居了, 如果這事情是真的, 那我懷疑她可以帶給我們女幸福, 因此我希望能有全部撫養權

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
You mean because your wife is still up with a divorce case with you, but she no longer live with you, is that right? Moreover, you think she’s living with another man. Regarding this situation that’s why you don’t want to share custody with your wife, is that right?

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對, 這都是我的考量

omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You mentioned you have several part-time jobs, since all of them are part-time jobs, can you make an evaluation about how much exactly you make each month?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
平均來說我大概有四五份兼職工作, 全部加起來的話一個月大概能賺五萬塊有時如果有接到新案子的話可以賺更多錢

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
And another question, after you get the sole custody of your child, will you take her to Canada and do not return? The reason why I’m asking this question that even if you get the sole custody, your wife still have the visitation right. So if you take your daughter back to Canada, it means that you’re cutting the tie between your wife and daughter. What do you think about that?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility of the father taking the child to Canada and not returning.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of the wife having visitation rights and the potential impact of taking the child to Canada.

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我已經在台灣住了五年, 我有這邊的居留權, 我也很喜歡這邊, 目前我並沒有離開台灣的計畫, 特別是我相信我女兒應該有權力能見到她的父母, 我要強調的是雖然我和我太太在打離婚官司, 但我並沒有打算切斷她們母女倆的聯繫, 在離婚官司的過程中我都會寄女兒的照片給她, 我甚至會安排時間為我們大家見面.

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
You mean you don’t have any plan to return to Canada at the moment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
不, 我回加拿大的原因只有可能是我媽老了病了. 就算如此我回去也不會停留太久, 我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒一起去

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I’m going to ask your wife some questions. You no longer live with your husband is that true?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'wife' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'live' instead of 'lived' to match the past tense in the original text.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes we’ve been parting for six months already.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Yes, we've been apart for six months already.'

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
So when did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
Well, about two month ago.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific information about what they provided.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'about' in the wrong position in the sentence.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So that means, before you file the divorce, you no longer live together right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

是的。
Yes

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So what is your living condition at the moment? Who do you live with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I’m living with my son from my first marriage.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the son being from the first marriage.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So what marriage are we talking here?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the number of marriages.

他是我第二任先生。
He’s my second husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'He is my second husband.'

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the child rearing case is about your second child, which is your daughter
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker's gender.

對。
Yes

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
How old is your son, and how old is your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
After you move out, did your daughter live with you or your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter's living arrangement.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'did' instead of 'does' to match the present tense of the original sentence.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
After I moved out, my daughter was just two months old, so she still needs me, and live with me.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker's daughter is living with them.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
What about now? Who does the child live with
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'live' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter lives with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. It should be 'Now my daughter is with my husband.'

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Did you have any agreement? Why did she live with you at first, and now with your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'middle' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'live with you' and 'at first', resulting in a grammatically incorrect sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'husband' as '他' which means 'he' instead of '你的丈夫' which means 'your husband'. This changes the meaning of the sentence.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I move out, I live in a smaller place, so my husband has a bigger place. The environment is better, so I think she’s better off with my husband.

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
Regardless of the objective circumstances, that’s still not…. Is that better for your daughter? So why do you want to get the sole custody of your daughter?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
After all, I’ve had her pregnant for ten months, she’s still my daughter. Besides, my husband is Canadian, and he doesn’t hold a stable job. In this concern, I may never see my daughter again. That’s why I want to get my daughter’s sole custody.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
As for your financial status, can you elaborate how are you going to raise your daughter?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
So far, we’re still up with the divorce case. I’m fighting for the right to live in my husband’s place after the divorce case. Based on the environment, I think my husband’s place would be suitable for my daughter’s growing up. As for my financial status, I’ve provided an asset list for the court. And I also have a job with an income of 40000 NT a month. So I think I’m capable of raising my daughter.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
So may I ask how is your divorce case proceeding? Do you know when will the court’s decision be made?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not sure, we will be in another court this Friday. I will ask the judge of the divorce case to come up with a court decision as soon as possible.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
How about we send a social worker to see both of you? So the social worker will make an evaluation based on how you interact with your daughter. We will take that evaluation as reference to see what works the best for your daughter. But before that, have you come to think about share custody? Basically, share custody is to have your daughter spend a certain amount of time with her father, and a certain amount of time with her mother.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect word choice

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人是不太贊同這種作法, 因為我女兒還太小, 她才八個月大, 我不希望她經歷我和我太太之間的流離失所, 對這麼小的小孩來說, 讓她以這種方式長大的話她會很困惑

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too little, she’s not suitable for a share custody.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
Ok, if that’s the case, we’ll first arrange a social worker to see how it goes. After there’s a result, we’ll arrange the next court time. And that both parties have the chance to elaborate.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
So first, I would like to ask the plaintiff some questions.The plaintiff, why do you want to be granted your child custody.As the court knows, you do not have a full-time job here in Taiwan.And you are a foreigner.On child custody, why do you think you have more custody than the other party?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the part about the defendant not having a full-time job in Taiwan.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of the defendant being a foreigner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the order of the question and the statement.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'granted' instead of 'fight for' in translating '爭取'.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我想要得到我女兒的單獨撫養權有兩個原因。第一，我的太太不再跟我住在一起了。我希望我可以陪我女兒長大。而且我聽到，我太太和別的男人同居。如果真的是這樣的話，我很懷疑他是否可以提供我女兒應得的照顧。所以我想要爭取撫養權。

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using '爭取撫養權' instead of '得到撫養權'

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
Do you mean that you are now engaged in a divorce case and you are no longer living together?And you doubt that your wife is living with another man.Because of the above-mentioned circumstances, you are unwilling to give your daughter to your wife, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect word choice

Yes, those are my main concerns.
是的，這就是我最擔心的原因。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
And regarding your financial status, if you are granted with your child’s sole custody, how can you take care of your daughter?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of financial status in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'And regarding your financial status' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '另外'.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在的確沒有全職的工作。但是我有好幾份兼差，也是有固定收入的。我相信這些固定的收入可以讓我和我女兒好好地生活。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs at present.Because these jobs are just part-time, can you approximately estimate how much income is regularly?

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均都會有四五個兼差工作。所以我一個月大概都會有五萬塊台幣的收入。如果我有得到更多案子的話，我的收入就會增加。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Is it possible that if you are granted with your child’s custody, you will go back to Canada and never come back again?The reason the courts asks so, even you are granted with the child custody, your wife can be granted with visitation right.If you brought your child back to Canada, it also made your daughter cut the tie with the mother. What’s your opinion to point?

我已經在台灣住五年了。我得到了居留證，也很喜歡這裡。目前並沒有離開台灣的計劃。尤其我覺得我女兒應該要有見到他雙親的權利。我想要強調的是，雖然我和我太太正在打離婚官司，但我並沒有想要我女兒和我太太切斷聯繫。即使在我們的離婚訴訟進行中，我也是固定有寄我女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至安排了一些時間，邀請我太太和我女兒一起度過一些時光。

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.

Now, the court would like to ask the defendant some questions. Are you no longer staying with your husband.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been no longer living together for six months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you file the divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
I filed the case around two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
So, before you filed the divorce, you hadn’t lived with your husband for a long time.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the plaintiff's marriage number.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the daughter in the original text.

Now, my daughter is living with my husband.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Is there an agreement between you? Why you brought your daughter with you, and she is now with your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'originally' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'daughter' and 'you' in the translation.

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I moved out, I found an apartment which is smaller than the place my husband is living. Taking living circumstances into consideration, my husband’s place is better than mine.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
If the objective circumstances remain the same, that is, your living environment, this is not better for your daughter, right? Why do you want to be granted with your child’s custody?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
I gave birth to my daughter, so how could I be separated from her? And my husband is a Canadian, and he does not have a stable job here. He may go back to Canada at any time. If that is the case, I will never my daughter again. Therefore, I hope to be granted with my daughter’s custody.

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
As to your financial status, how could you afford your daughter’s spending?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now, we are still engaged in a divorce case. So, I would like to ask to live in the apartment my husband lives now after our divorce. Based on the living environment, the apartment will be suitable for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have provided my asset list to the court. Besides, I have stable job, my regular income is at least 40000 NT dollars per month. So, I think I have the ability to rear my daughter.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing the asset list to the court.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'after our divorce' in the wrong position in the sentence.

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
And how is your divorce case going? Do you know the estimated date that the court’s decision comes out?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I am not sure. We have another court this Friday. I would like to ask the judge of the divorce case to give the court’s decision as soon as possible.

這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
So, the court will arrange some social workers to visit both of your places, the plaintiff and the defendant. And evaluate your relations with your daughter from your both sides. The court will take the social worker’s evaluation into consideration to give the court’s decision to make sure what is suitable for the child. Before that, the court would like to make sure that have you ever considered to share the custody? The shared custody means the child will live with the father for some time, and live with the mother for some time.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '相對人' as 'defendant' instead of 'other party'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '共同撫養' as 'shared custody' instead of 'joint custody'

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我個人不太考慮這一點，因為我女兒還太小。他只有八個月大而已。我不想要他跟經歷我和太太的離異過程。對一個那麼小的小孩來講，可能會造成他認知上的混淆，如果他必須跟他的父親住一段時間，又再去跟母親住一段時間的話。

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
As to this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young to arrange this way at such a young age.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific arrangement being referred to.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'at such a young age' in the wrong position in the sentence.

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
If that is the case, we will schedule first the visits of the social workers. After they finish their evaluation, we will schedule our next court date. So, the both parties have the chance to state your opinions. Is that all right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
是的，我接受社工來訪。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'workers' in the translation.

沒有問題，謝謝。
I have no problems, too. Thank you.

omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
Today what I mainly want to do is to understand what is your standpoint on your child custody, and I would also like to know why you think you are the more appropriate one to rear the child. Please focus on this point and elaborate. In addition, I know you are also filing for a divorce case, so I hope that won’t make any verbal attack each other. Is that OK with you?

I understand.
我知道了。

了解。
OK, I understand.

請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
First, I would like to ask the plaintiff some questions. Why would you like to…why would you like your child’s custody? As far as I am concerned, now in Taiwan you don’t have a full-time job. You are a foreigner. On the matter of child custody, why do you think you are the more appropriate person?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'to ask the plaintiff some questions' in the beginning of the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'why would you like to' and 'why would you like your child's custody', resulting in incorrect sentence structure.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '撫養權' (custody) as 'child's custody', which is not an accurate translation.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate the phrase '爭取子女撫養權' (fight for child custody) in the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '適任' (appropriate) as 'more appropriate', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
我主要…我想要就是全部的小孩撫養權有兩個原因。首先，我的太太沒有再跟我們一起住了，我想要在那裡看我女兒長大，而且我聽說我太太跟另外一個男人住在一起。如果是那樣子的話，我懷疑她到底能不能給我們的小孩最好的照顧。因此，我希望有全部的撫養權。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
What you mean is that although your wife is still going on a divorce case with you, she no longer lives with you, and you also doubt that she lives with another man. So…because of the…based on the above reasons, you don’t want the child to be raised by her, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	rearranged sentence structure
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	changed the meaning of the original text

Yes, those are my main concerns.
對，這是我主要的顧慮。

另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
As to your financial status, that is to say, if you don’t have a full-time job, how are you going to raise your child…your daughter?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker's financial status and the fact that they don't have a full-time job.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'your daughter' at the end of the sentence instead of immediately after 'raise your child'.

It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
我現在確實是沒有全職的工作，但是我有幾個…幾個工作，收入也很固定。這個固定收入可以讓我照顧我自己跟我的女兒。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
You just said that you have several part-time jobs. Because all of them are part-time jobs, can you estimate how much income you have each month?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the nature of the part-time jobs being discussed.

I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
我平均來說有四到五份兼職工作，全部加起來的話，每個月大概有五萬多塊台幣，如果我有其他額外的工作的話，收入可能會更多。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '多塊' (more) to '五萬' (50,000)

另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
Another thing I want to ask is that, is it possible that after you get your child’s custody, you will take her to Canada and not coming back? The reason I ask is that although you get your custody, your wife still have the visitation right, and she can regularly visit your daughter. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, you will be indirectly cutting the tie between them…between your wife and your daughter. So…about this, what is your opinion?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'cutting the tie'

I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
我在台灣已經待五年了。我有居留證，而且我蠻喜歡…我很喜歡這裡。我目前沒有離開台灣的打算，而且我覺得小孩有權利見他的父母。我想說的是，就算我現在要跟我老婆離婚，我沒有打算要切斷我女兒和我老婆的聯繫。在打離婚官司的期間，我…就是定期會傳女兒的照片給老婆看。我甚至還會…就是安排一起出去玩，讓老婆也可以看看小孩。

所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
So what you’re saying that so far you don’t have a plan…to go back to Canada, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
對，我有可能會回去，但只是因為我媽年紀大了或生病之類的，但是就算我回去，我也不會待太久。我根本就不會想要把女兒一起帶去。

那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
Now I would like to ask the other party some questions. Do you no longer live with your husband now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

對，我們已經分居六個月了。
Yes, we have been separated for six months.

請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
When did you…when did you file your divorce case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我大概是兩個月前提的。
About two months ago.

也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
That is to say, before you filed your divorce case, you longer live together, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

是的。
Yes.

那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
So who do you live with now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
I live with my son, who is the child of my first marriage.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the son is living with the speaker.

第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
First marriage? So…this time…
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question about the number of marriages.

他是我第二任先生。
He is my second husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'husband' does not accurately convey the meaning of '先生' which means 'Mr.' or 'mister' in English.

所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
So the custody we’re not talking about is…with your husband and is a daughter…your daughter.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'fighting for' custody and 'between you and your second husband'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'we're not talking about' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'custody'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '爭的子女撫養權' as 'the custody we're not talking about' instead of 'fighting for custody'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The user used 'your husband' instead of 'your second husband'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after 'husband' in the original text.

對。
Yes.

你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
So how old is your son? How old is your daughter.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question marks at the end of each sentence.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include the question marks at the end of each sentence.

我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
My son is seven years old, and my daughter is five months old…eight months old.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the age of the daughter is incorrect.

那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
When you are…separate with your husband, is your daughter with you or with your husband…was.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'moving out' and 'living' from the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'is' instead of 'was' in the question.

因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
When…because at that time my daughter was only two months old, she needed my care, so I took her with me.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about moving out.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'because' after 'when' instead of before.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '女兒跟我' as 'I took her with me' instead of 'the child was with me'.

那現在孩子在誰那裏？
So where is…where is the child now? Is she with you or with your husband?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

現在女兒在我先生那裏。
Now my daughter is with my husband.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the current situation of the daughter being with the husband.

你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
Did you have some sort of negotiation before? Why is your…why was her with you a few months ago, and now she is with your husband.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
After I moved out, my house was smaller. The one I lived with my husband is bigger. Because the environment is better, I sent my daughter to my husband.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '交給'

那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
So…if the objective circumstances are not changed...your living place, the environment is still better for your daughter, right? So why do you want your child’s custody, then?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
She is my daughter who I spent ten months bearing…ten months…how would I bear not seeing her? And my husband is Canadian. He’s work in Taiwan is not very stable. He will possibly go back to Canada at any time. In that case, I wouldn’t see my daughter anymore, right? So I would like to…so I would like to have my daughter’s custody.

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
Based on your financial status…can you…can you tell us how you are going to rear your child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
Now we are still going on the divorce case. I hope that now we can let our daughter live in my husband’s house now. Based…in concerned of the environment, the house is better for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have give…I have gave…I have given the court my asset list. In addition, I also have a full-time job, I income every month is 40,000 dollars. I think I am capable of raising my daughter.
omission or addition	omission of details	omission of critical context: the user did not mention the ongoing divorce case and the purpose of the statement
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order: 'Based...in concerned of the environment' should be 'In concerned of the environment, based...'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order: 'I income every month is 40,000 dollars' should be 'My income every month is 40,000 dollars'

請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
How is your divorce case going on now? Do you know when…when…when we will see the result, or about when we will see the result of the divorce case?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the divorce case.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
I’m not quite sure. We will go on the court for the divorce case on this Friday again. I hope that I can tell the judge of the divorce case that the sentence be granted as soon as possible.

Maybe…we will ask a social worker to regularly visit the plaintiff and the other party and make some evaluation based on seeing your relationship between you and your daughter. The court will…will take reference of their reports and see which party is better of raising the child. Before that, I would like to ask if you both…are you willing to have shared custody? That means that your daughter will be living with husband…with her father for a while and with her mother for another time.

Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
我目前不是很同意這個決…這個方法。他才八個月大而已，我不想她在我跟我老婆之間這樣來來回回的。對一個年紀這麼小的小孩而言，一段時間跟爸爸住，一段時間跟媽媽住，這樣對她來說會很混亂。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
On this issue, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small for…to young for shared custody...to be raising by shared custody…to be raised custody.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why don’t you think that there will be no problem to bring the gold to Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	double negative	The user's translation contains a double negative, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

我在三月的時候遇到肯特，我想那個時候我會為他工作，甚至跟他合作。他看起來是好人，我也不覺得他會騙我。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
You mean that Kant seem to be cooperate with you ,so you trust him, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對我以為我們會一起當工作伙伴，所以我信任他。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text expresses trust in someone, while the user's translation mentions the expectation of becoming work partners.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
So other than the question you have answered, is there anything you want to state? Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
So, besides the question you have answered, do you want to mention other thing? Do you want to make other statement? Do you want to ask the court to investigate further evidence?

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
Besides the cell phone, you also mention four hundred US dollars. Is this also the monetary compensation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想這400只是支付我住宿和吃飯的錢
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'just' in the original text.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
Besides four hundred dollars, when you return to Thailand successfully, you will also get one thousand dollars, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
我的理解是這樣，當我把袋子給在台灣接應的人之後，回泰國就會拿到1000美金
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and getting another thousand dollars when coming back to Bangkok. However, the user's translation talks about giving the bag to someone in Taiwan and receiving 1000 US dollars when returning to Thailand.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
When you received the task, you know the bag you take is heroine, right?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'heroine' is used instead of 'heroin', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
 我一點也不知道袋子裡面藏有海洛因
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the club where the heroin was hidden.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Don’t you think that if someone ask you to take gold to Taiwan, and the price is 1000 US dollars, the price is a little high?

grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a question mark at the end of the sentence.

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不知道這樣行情是否有點高，但我只想賺點小外快。

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you ever wonder that why he came to here by person?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
Kent跟我說他很忙，他需要另一個人來做這件事

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就只是黃金，應該不會有太大問題

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'inside' in the translation.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
我沒打開檢查，因為是密封的，我不覺得打開是正確的
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the bag being sealed.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '打開' (open) before the subject '我' (I), resulting in incorrect word order.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
 You just trust the person, don’t you think you would be cheated?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在2013年三月十見過他，我覺得我們有機會成為生意夥伴，所以才接下這份差事，我覺得他是好人，應該不會騙我。

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
是的，我覺得我會和他一起合作，所以我才相信他。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
Besides the statement you mention, anything to add? Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我對這件事感到抱歉，真的不知道袋子裡面有什麼，我以為袋子裡面是黃金，知道裡面是海洛因的話，我就不會答應，我對我的行為感到抱歉。

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'receive' before the subject 'you', which is incorrect.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So when you took the promise, you knew it was heroin?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '帶的是海洛因' as 'you knew it was heroin', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text implies that the person knew they were carrying heroin when they accepted the promise, not that they knew the promise itself was heroin.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
我不知道，我以為他要我帶的是黃金
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user incorrectly translated 'heroin' as '黃金' which means 'gold' instead of '海洛因' which means 'heroin'.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
don’t you think that if ask you to bring gold to Taiwan, the price is too high ?

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我沒想過這個

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Have you ever wondered that why the person did not bring it by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
我不知道，我只是想賺點錢
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not convey the same meaning as the original text. Instead of Kent asking for help, the user's translation suggests that they don't know and just want to make some money.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
If what in the golf bag was really gold, you should know bringing gold in to another country can be illegal, don’t you think so?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original meaning

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我沒想那麼多，只是帶黃金而已
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？

Did you check what is in the bag, when you took it?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the action of checking the contents of the bag.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有，因為他交給我的時候袋子是密封的，我覺得我應該不能打開它
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of receiving the bag from someone else.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I don't think I can open a bag' as '我覺得我應該不能打開它' which means 'I think I shouldn't be able to open it'. The meaning is slightly different from the original text.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
You trusted him. You didn’t feel that he might con you
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月的時候就認識肯特了，我們有可能成為工作夥伴，我想他不會騙我的

You mean that he wanted to work with you so you did not feel he may lie to you?

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特跟我說他很忙，這是一種幫他的方式

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
Do you really that trust the man? Don’t you feel the possibility of being…
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在三月遇見肯特，對我來說我們兩個就像是合作的夥伴。他人看起來很好，我不覺得他會騙我

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
沒錯，這就是為什麼我會跟他合作並相信他的原因。

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user mentions meeting in Taiwan and taking a golf bag, which is not mentioned in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text. The user places the verb '拿' (take) before the noun '高爾夫球袋' (golf bag), while in the original text, the verb 'take' is not mentioned and the noun 'bag' is referred to as 'the bag'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我認為那400美元只是為了支付我的飯店跟吃的費用吧。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the amount of $400 in their translation.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So, besides the four hundred US dollars, when you successfully go back to Thailand, will you get another one thousand US dollars?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.

我不知道價錢算不算高，我只是想賺點小錢。

我只知道在泰國黃金蠻便宜的阿,我根本就不知道帶進台灣是違法的

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that there was a possibility of becoming work mates later on.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我就只是想為他工作而已' (I just want to work for him) twice in the sentence, which disrupts the natural word order.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'he won't lie to me' as '我不認為他會欺騙我' (I don't think he will deceive me), which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'won't lie'.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'gold' as '黃金' (huángjīn), which means 'gold' in Chinese. However, the original text mentioned 'heroin', not 'gold'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '我' (wǒ) before the verb '知道' (zhīdào), resulting in incorrect word order. The correct word order should be '我不知道' (wǒ bù zhīdào), meaning 'I don't know'.

他告訴我如果我幫他把這個高爾夫球袋帶到台灣，他就會給我一千美金。我就想賺點外快嘛，而且這聽起來不是很難的工作。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	高爾夫球袋 (gāo ěr fū qiú dài) should be translated as 'golf bag' instead of 'the bag'

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the amount of money being paid

你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
So you did you say…the other person agree you to pay you…pay you some compensation and the price…and ask you to take this bag to Taiwan, is that right?

對，他告訴我只要把袋子帶進台灣，其他甚麼都不用做。

Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
對，這支就是Kent給我的手機。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cell' in the translation.

請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
Is this cellphone belongs to you?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'belongs' should agree with the subject 'cellphone', so it should be 'Does this cellphone belong'

No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
不是，這支手機不是”我的”。這支手機是Kent給我的。他把SIM卡放進去之後才把這支手機給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這支手機不是我的'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他把SIM卡放進去之後才把這支手機給我'.

那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
So what is the exact purpose or the use of this cellphone that he gave you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the word order in the question

He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
他告訴我他會透過這支手機連絡我，而且那個…理論上要來拿這個袋子的人，他也會用這支手機聯絡我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of golf bags in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '理論上要來拿這個袋子的人' in the wrong position in the sentence.

也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
Which means there will someone contact you through this cellphone number, meet you, and take the bag from you…after you get into Taiwan?

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對，Kent跟我說會有人跟我聯絡，然後會來拿這個袋子。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我完全不知道誰會連絡我。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
As you had mentioned earlier, beside the cellphone, the one who give you…the man also gave you four hundred US dollars. Is that…can you count…is that a compensation for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'man' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'also' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '算是酬勞嗎?' as 'can you count...is that a compensation for you?', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想這筆錢是用來付旅館和我吃…食物的費用。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'bills' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '食物' (food) at the end of the sentence instead of after '我吃' (I eat).

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So…besides this four hundred US dollars, after you success…after you finished you job and get back to Thailand, will you receive another one thousand US dollars?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
對，我想應該是這樣子沒有錯。等我把袋子成功交給對方，然後在回代泰國之後，我就會再收到另外一千美金。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and receiving another thousand dollars when returning to Bangkok, but the user's translation talks about successfully handing over the bag to someone and receiving another thousand dollars after returning to Thailand.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So when the very beginning…when you take…took this job, do you understand…do you know that the thing you are carrying is heroine?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'heroin' as 'heroine'

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不不不…我完全…完全不知道在球袋裡面藏的是海洛因。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the club where the heroin was hidden.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
Well…do you think the cost...if just bringing gold into Taiwan, this price, which means one thousand dollars, a little bit too high for this job
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我真的不知道這個代價是不是真的太高。但我就只是想賺點零用錢嘛。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions wanting to make a little extra money, while the user's translation mentions not knowing if the price is too high.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Did it ever cross your mind why the person don’t want to bring the thing by them…by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
Kent跟我說他很忙，就需要有人來幫他這個忙。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Kent wanting someone to help him.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
Well…even if there is real gold in the golf bag, you should…you should know it might be illegal to bring gold into Taiwan, isn’t it?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original meaning

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我知道黃金在泰國是比較便宜，但我真的不知道帶黃金入境是不是在台灣是算是違法的事情。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why did you think it won’t be a problem to bring gold into Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金不就是黃金嘛，應該不會是甚麼大問題，不是嗎
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'no big deal' is not translated correctly.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
When you bringing the bag, did you ever exam the thing inside it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after 'bag'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'exam' should be 'check'.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有，我沒有檢查，因為袋子被封起來了。我覺得我可能不太應該把袋子打開。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of checking the bag.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '打開' (open) at the end of the sentence instead of after '袋子' (bag).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '應該' (should) instead of '能' (can) to express the ability to open the bag.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
So you were just that trust the other person? Don’t you ever thought the possibility of being de…deceived
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我和Kent在三月認識的時候，我本來是要幫他工作的，我就是有可能成為夥伴阿，所以我是可以…我當然願意幫他工作。他看起來人很好啊，是個好人，我沒有想過他會騙我。

So do you mean the other person have…have indicated the work relationship with you, so you don’t ever doubt him?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對，我覺得…我以為我們會一起工作，這就是我這麼信任他的原因。

As you mentioned, the person who gave you the golf bag also gave you 400 US dollars, is it a kind of monetary compensation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'golf bag' as 'mobile phone' and 'monetary compensation' as '酬勞' which means 'remuneration'.

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想那筆錢只是用來支付我的餐費還有旅館的費用而已
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'just' in the original text.

所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
So except the 400 US dollars, you mean after you go back to Bangkok, you get another 100 dollars? Rather, 1000 dollars.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

我是這麼想的，我的理解是當我順利的將高爾夫球袋拿到台灣並且順利地交給那個人之後，回到泰國我可以拿到我的酬勞
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions bringing a bag into Taiwan and getting another thousand dollars when returning to Bangkok, while the user's translation talks about successfully delivering a golf bag to someone in Taiwan and receiving their reward when returning to Thailand.

所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
So do you know what you broght to Taiwan is heroine
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '海洛因' as 'heroine' instead of 'heroin'.

No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
不不不，我根本不知道海洛因藏在球桿裡面
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the club in their translation.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the amount of 1000 US dollars.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'for gold' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'monetary compensation'.

我沒有特別去思考報酬是不是過高，我只是想賺錢而已
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the amount of money they want to make.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
Then have you think of that what did the person bring his bag to Taiwan by himself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特跟我說他太忙碌了，所以需要一個人幫他帶過來
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the specific request for help from Kent.

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'golf' instead of 'gold'

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我想說黃金在泰國沒有很值錢，我沒有想過帶來台灣會是違法的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that gold is cheaper in Thailand, but the user's translation states that gold is not valuable in Thailand.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
What do you think bringing to Taiwan isn’t a problem?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金不就是黃金而已嗎? 會構成什麼大問題呢?

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
Have you checked what is inside the golf bag when you took it?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'golf' in the translation.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
沒有ㄟ我沒有檢查，因為袋子是密封的，我不覺得我可以擅自打開他
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of checking the bag.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '檢查' (check) after the subject '我' (I), instead of before it.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I don't think I can open a bag' as '我不覺得我可以擅自打開他' which means 'I don't think I can open it without permission'. The meaning of 'without permission' was added, changing the original meaning.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
So you just easy trust the person and never thought you might be conned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我在3月的時候讓是肯特的，你知道當時我準備跟他合作經營公司，所以我想我應該可以幫助他，他看起來是個好人，我不覺得他會騙我

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '準備' (prepare) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我準備' (I prepared).

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '覺得' (think) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我覺得' (I think).

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
So you men Kent want to cooperate with you to run a business so you think there is no problem with him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對啊我想說我們會一起合作，所以就不疑有他
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not convey the same meaning as the original text. The original text expresses trust in someone, while the user's translation talks about working together without doubt.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
OK, beside what you have mentioned before, do you have anything else to say? Is there and evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我對於發生的一切感到很抱歉，我真的不知道袋子裡面裝了什麼，我當時真的以為袋子裡面裝的是黃金，如果我知道他是海洛因的話，我絕對不會貪心到把它帶來台灣的，請原諒我

目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
Now you are in detention, do you want to contact with anyone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical context of notifying someone on behalf of the person in detention.

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？

我對此感到很抱歉，我不知道袋子裡面裝了什麼東西。我以為裡面是黃金，要是有人和我說裡面是海洛因的話，我絕對不會答應要帶到台灣的。請原諒我。

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
Why did you trust that person so easily? Weren’t you afraid of being conned?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
是，我認為我們以後會變同事，一起工作，所以我就信任他了。

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
 Okay, so after these questions, do you have anything to add? Is there any evidence the court wishes to further investigate?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
Do you really trust that person that much and do not think that you will be conned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我真的所發生的事很抱歉，我不知道袋子裡子藏了什麼東西，他告訴我袋子裡面是黃金，如果我知道袋子裡面是海洛因的話，我真的不會帶這個袋子來台灣。請原諒我。

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'phone' in the translation.
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user did not include the word 'phone' in the translation, which is important for understanding the context of the sentence.

是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
On which day did he give you the cell phone? In addition to the cell phone, did he give you any other things else?

He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
他在我離開曼谷前一天給我那支手機的，除了手機，他還給我400美金供我吃住。

which means that when you took this cell phone into Taiwan, someone will call you, meet you up and take the golf bag?

Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
對，肯特跟我說當我到台灣的時候，就會有人打電話給我跟我拿高爾夫球袋
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'bag' as '高爾夫球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of the intended meaning of 'bag' in the original text.

那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
Do you know that who will get into contact with you?

No, I don't know who's going to call me.
不，我不知道誰會打給我

你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？

I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
我想這筆錢應該就是提供我吃住吧

對我是這麼想的。在我把高爾夫球袋給指定的人之後，可以回到泰國，並且拿到1000塊美金。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'bag' as '高爾夫球袋' which means 'golf bag' instead of '包裹' which means 'bag' in general.

你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
don’t you think that if he just wants you to bring gold into Taiwan, this price, I mean 1000 US dollars is a bit too high?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '代價' as 'price' instead of 'cost'

I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
我不管他給我多少錢，我只是想要賺錢而已
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text expresses uncertainty about the amount of money, while the user's translation implies indifference towards the amount of money.

你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？

omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
肯特只是告訴我他很忙，他需要有人幫他

就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'in Taiwan' at the end of the sentence instead of immediately after 'bringing gold'.

I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
我只知道黃金在泰國的確是比較便宜，但我不知道戴黃金進入台灣是不是違法的
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about not knowing if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.

你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
Why do you think that bringing gold into Taiwan won’t have any problem?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
黃金就是黃金，應該沒什麼大問題吧，不是嗎?

你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
When you took the bag, did you check what is inside?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of checking the goods inside the bag.

No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
我沒有查，因為袋子封起來了，我不覺得我應該打開它
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'think' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？
You trusted him so deeply, didn’t you think that you might be conned?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
我和肯特是在三月見面的，所以我們可能成為夥伴啊，之後可能還需要替他工作呢。我覺得他看起來人蠻好的，我不覺得他會騙我啊
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that there was a possibility of becoming work mates later on.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '在三月' after the verb '見面的', which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我和肯特是三月見面的'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the plural form '我們' (we) with the singular verb '是' (am). The correct subject-verb agreement should be '我' (I) instead of '我們'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the present tense '看起來' (looks) to describe a past event. The correct tense should be the past tense '看起來' (looked).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '夥伴' (partner) instead of '工作夥伴' (work mate).

你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
so do you mean that he said that he wanted to cooperate with you so that’s why you didn’t suspect him, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
對，我覺得我們之後會一起工作，所以我才這麼信任他
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text expresses trust in someone, while the user's translation suggests trust in the future.

除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
in addition to the questions you had answered, do you have any other thing to add? Do you have anything that want the court to further investigate?

I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
我真的對這件事情深感懊悔，我真的不知道袋子裡有什麼。我只知道裡面是黃金，如果我知道裡面裝的是海洛因，我就不會把他帶到台灣了，請你原諒我

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for adultery. The plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case of today. It’s mainly because her husband John Anderson has an intimate relation with one of the teacher in the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. Plus, the defendant usually tends to go home late and has close relation with Tsai Yen Wang in the cram school and even had video telephoning. The plaintiff found that everything proves that her husband and his coworker are actually beyond coworker’s relationship. That’s why the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, your wife suspects you of committing adultery. What’s your plea?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
For today’s preparatory procedure, we are mainly here for the contents of those intimate messages. In order to figure out whether the defendant really has adultery with his coworker. Do both parties understand the procedures?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
I have questions for the plaintiff. How long have you been married to your husband? Do you have any children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
My husband and I have married for four years and we don’t have any children.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'been' in the sentence.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you and your husband get married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan. Four years ago he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker being the wife.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'came' before the subject 'he', which is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '認識' as 'met' instead of 'know'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past few years, your husband’s work in Taiwan was teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
Well, when we just met he was an Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued to teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular foreign language to learn in Taiwan so his teaching hours were quite unstable. Sometimes he might have a period between jobs. This period can be long to a month. Afterwards, in order to make his income more stable, he started to teach English. But because his mother tongue is not English, he decides to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. Does this mean a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in their translation.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan so that degree must be related to English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California for teaching English. He doesn’t have to go to America but still can have the courses by on-line learning. In this case, after he finishes all the courses he can get a master degree. His plan is through this degree he got from the United States he can get a job in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s his relationship with this woman that he commits the adultery?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in cram school. The cram school arranges he to partner with somebody, a Taiwanese, and that woman was his partner.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know that they have adultery?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'adultery' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first I just found out that my husband stayed quite long after work in the cram school. I have asked him several times that it’s just an English cram school, why did you need to stay so long after work in the cram school? He told me that because he had to partner with a Taiwanese so that they needed a lot of time to communicate and discuss about the course. At the very beginning, I really didn’t suspect him of anything. After I found out he got some phone calls quite often after work and when he received the call, he couldn’t speak in front of me. He always went to the study room. It started to make me curious so I began to check his phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything unusual in his cellphone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'his' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'find'.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I saw that in his phone book I saw a number quite often. Because of that, I was curious again and started to check his messages. After the checking I found that he had messages of the same woman every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the phone number and the frequency of the messages.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the context of why they were checking the messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
They are just some messages, or are there any problems with the messages?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of the messages being text messages.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they are just some normal messages then it’s okay. But he’s a married man, how could he receive some intimate messages from others. Before, I did offer some contents of the messages to the court. They should already been included in the documents.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please show the evidence record, page number 13. There are few messages. Please the defendant have a look. Are these messages from your phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對，這是我手機裡的簡訊
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '裡' (in) before '手機' (cell phone), which is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I have few questions concerning these messages for you. The first message was at 9:50 on the date 31st November in 2002 from the cellphone number 0958932xxx. The contents were “I really miss you my love.” What did that mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
喔，這只是我一個同事傳給我的，我記得我那時候大概放了兩天假吧，她大概是有點擔心，這就是為什麼她傳給我這封簡訊啊。我的同事她在美國受教育所以她算是心胸鰻寬闊的，這就是她說話的方式還有自我表現的方式。至於「my love」這個字，只是用來稱呼一些我們關心的人
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	adding unnecessary information
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Did you mean that because this colleague has spent some time in the united states, her thought was kind of westernized and her way of expressing herself was quite open as well. So “my love” means nothing special, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its cultural connotations.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
不是，這只是一個很平常的稱呼而已，就是用來稱呼我們在乎的人。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation simply states that it is a common term used to address people they care about.

那她前面那句呢？
what about the sentence before

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我剛剛講過了，她很擔心我，我們是工作上面的同事，當我沒去工作兩天，她當然會想我啊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean she’s just because you hadn’t been to work for two days, that’s why she sent you this message; because without your assistance in the class so she misses you? Is that all?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對，這就是簡訊的內容，這沒有什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in the translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second text was at 11:55pm on 13rd January in 2003. This message was from the same number as the first one. The content was “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together我希望你在我身邊 我們什麼時候才能真正在一起呢”. What does this message mean? Why is it possible to have this kind of contexts?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	translation of 'truly' as '真正' instead of '真正在一起'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我希望你在我身邊 我們什麼時候才能真正在一起呢'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫給我這句話是因為想告訴我一個課本上面出現的句子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Do you mean she send you this message because she wants you help from the text book? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
因為我太太幫我申請這個課程，所以我有一個線上教學的課程。在這個課程裡我需要修滿30個學分才可以拿到學位。當然我會需要完成一些練習啊，還有作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you please explain what’s your master degree about?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'first' in the translation.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a question mark at the end of the sentence.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是英語教學，這個課程裡爸都是跟英語教學有關的，但有些其他課程是跟文化還有語言能力相關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'program' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'some' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'courses' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'English' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'teaching' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'and' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'others' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'related' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'to' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'culture' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'and' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'language' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the word 'competence' in the sentence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So the master degree is mainly about English teaching but there are some courses about language competence and culture, is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得大概有三門課都和文化還有溝通相關吧。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'courses' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '大概有三門課' (approximately three courses) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'related to culture and communication'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '大概' (approximately) instead of 'at least' to convey the meaning of uncertainty.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So how do the courses related to communication? What kind of assignments they gave you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'related' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'related' and 'courses' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
關於文化與溝通的作業呢，針對每個學生都是不一樣的，以我自己為例，我是一個在台灣想獲得英語教學資格的人，為了達成這個要求，我需要符合一些資格，必須要具備一定的中文能力，所以我有一些作業都是中文和英語之間的翻譯。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect terms

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan so you have to prove yourself with enough Chinese competence, is that right? Thus, you have to finish some assignments from the course and these assignments are translation between English and Chinese. Is that true?

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對，就是這樣，我真的很想增進自己的寫作能力還有說的能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s go back to what we discussed before that it’s your assignment right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得這個句子啊，當我拿到這個中文句子的時候，我實在不知道怎麼樣用英文表達，你們都知道吧，有些中文字對外國人來說真的很難。我需要一些幫助，所以像我同事求救，我請她翻譯這個句子然後用簡訊傳給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the part about asking the colleague for help

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You meant that you sent her the Chinese sentence and she sent you back the English translation of that sentence. So this message was just the answer for your assignments?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text, specifically the part about asking the colleague for the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'you sent her the Chinese sentence' instead of 'you sent her the Chinese sentence'.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，這封簡訊就只是我作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the homework assignment.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Again, let’s have a look at the record from page 14 to 16. Here are some contents of the messages. Please have a careful look at the contents. Were all of these the answers of your assignments so that she sent you these messages?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，全部的簡訊都是我作業的答案。

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
what’s your explanation for your wife’s suspect of you having adultery with your colleague Tsai yen Wang?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's suspicion in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'your wife' after the verb 'suspect' instead of before it.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'adultery' instead of 'having an affair', which is a more accurate translation.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了啦，我知道她對我對這個家的貢獻不太滿意，我希望庭上了解，在我開始修這個遠距課程的時候，她就沒有提供我任何課業上的幫助，她根本一點都不想幫我完成這個學位，如果她當初願意多幫助我一些，我就不用像我同事尋求協助啦，我覺得他應該要為這一切、這個事件負責。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to you saying, it seems that you and your wife are not getting along too well, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們一開始結婚的時候，的確是處的蠻不錯的，但問題是在於我失業了，剛我想在台灣教葡萄牙語但工作時數很不穩定，所以我工作的問題就變成我們倆爭執的來源，我們常常為了這個問題吵架，她不相信我已經盡力了，我實在無法讓她了解我現在這個時期有多痛苦多難熬。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s go back to the master degree we just discussed. When did you start the master degree? Has it ended already? When will you get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年的春天開始上這個課，這個課程是兩年制，我應該要在2012年年底完成。我沒有辦法完成這個學位，因為我一邊上課一邊工作，沒有時間完成所有的作業。我剛剛前面有說過了，我太太完全不想幫忙，我覺得我好像一個人孤身奮戰想取得這個學位，我變得很累而且很沮喪。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that it’s a two-year course but you didn’t finish it at the end. Why?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the reason for not finishing the course.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成所有課程的要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'couldn't' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When did you last register for the courses? When will it end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
上一次註冊的課程是在2012年秋季班。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'semester' in the translation.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a period at the end of the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'semester' as '課程' which means 'course' instead of '學期' which means 'semester'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
According to what you just mentioned, the last day of your course will be December 5th, 2012 so after that you shouldn’t have any more assignments right? But the messages were actually six months after the course ended. What’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我可能的確是沒有完成這個課程啦，但這不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。即使我沒有辦法取得學位，但我持續想精進我的中文能力，這就是為什麼我還是繼續練習啊
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You what you meant is that even you couldn’t get the degree, you still want to continue learning Chinese to make it become more fluent. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是我向我同事尋求協助的原因
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '這就是我向我同事尋求協助的原因' which is not present in the original text.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague is actually serving as a tutor for you right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是像一個家教還是一個真正的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
我曾經想付錢給她，但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經想付錢給她，但她拒絕了'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she need to send you messages that it’s the time that she should already fall into sleep? Wasn’t that beyond what a colleague should do?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個真的想幫忙我的朋友啊，她用她自己的時間來幫我學習中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'very' in the translation, which changes the intensity of the friend's supportiveness.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
對，她還在這家補習班任職，但是我們不再是搭檔了

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any further evidence to investigate?

I want to subpoena Tsai yen Wang who teaches in Powen cram school to come to the court to give us some information. I would like her to clarify her relationship with the defendant and the background of writing all these messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague's name, Wang Caiyan.

omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the purpose of the colleague's testimony, which is to explain the content and purpose of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I’ve heard that the cram school had some actions according to the relation between my husband and that woman. In that discussion, they also mentioned the unemployment of tsai yen wang. I wander if I can ask evidences from the cram school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
The defendant, do you want the court to find any evidence for you? Now the fact is that your master course has already ended on December 5th in 2012. You have no right to blame all these messages on completing the assignments. Especially that all your messages were sent after 9pm. This is really doubting. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到任何可以請庭上幫我調查的證據，我剛剛說過了，我和我同事之間的關係真的非常的簡單，我真的只是想增進我的中文能力然後繼續學習中文。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you been married with your husband?Do you have a kid?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'

omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	The period at the end of the sentence is missing.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
So you and your husband get married  in the foreign country or in Taiwan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I meet my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he went to Taiwan because he want to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker and her husband met in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'went' instead of 'came' to describe the husband's arrival in Taiwan.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'meet' instead of 'met' to describe the past event of meeting the husband.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In past few year, is his job mainly focus on teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese. After we get married, he still teach the Portuguese.Since Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hour is not very stable. Sometimes there are a few months between the two cases.So he want to increase his income, he decided to teach English.However, his mother’s tongue is not English, so he decided to seek advance degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he decided to seek a advance degree.You mean he decided to get the degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in the translation.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He want to teach english in Taiwan, so he have to get the degree related to english teaching.He found a distance learning progress on internet, and it is in California. He can go to the class without going to America. After he get all the….. he can get the master degree.In his plan is that through this project, after he finished his degree, he can teach english in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is the relationship between your husband and the person who he has affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleague in the cram school.That  cram school arrange partner for teaching, and his partner is….that girl.
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the information about the girl being a 中師 (Chinese teacher)

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have adultery?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'adultery' which is a more severe term than the original meaning of '怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？' which means 'How do you know they are having an affair?'

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
First I noticed that my husband always stayed at cram school, working late.I asked him for many time that it is only a english cram school, there is no necessary to do extra works.He told me that since he had partner with a chinese teacher, so he have to spend some time to do the teaching plan. At first time, I really didn’t doubt him. Then, I noticed that after he came back home, there are some strange phone calls. And when he picked up the phone, he will go to the room and talk on the phone instead of in front of me. It makes me suspect him, so I check his cell phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Do you see any unusual thing in the cell phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is a same number appeared oftenly. So I check his message box.After that I found that he almost have contact with a same woman almost everyday.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the phone number and the content of the messages.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide any context or explanation for why they were curious about the person's text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'I was curious, so I checked his messages.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'contact' instead of 'communicate' or 'exchange messages', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
 It is only some message. Is there any inappropriate information or context?
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation omits the critical context of the message being a text message and whether the content is appropriate or not.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it is just a normal message, that is okay.But he is already a married man, how can he let another woman to send some intimate message?I have already filed some of the message to the court previously. It should be contained in the filed.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please show the investigation file on page thirteen.There are some of the message in the cell phone.Defendant, please check the message. Are these message in your cell phone.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，這些是我的簡訊內容。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
So I will ask some question based on these message. The first message is sent from nine fifty, november thirty first, 2011. And it’s from 0958-932xxx. The context is I really miss you, my love. What does that mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'miss' as 'miss' is correct, but the translation of 'my love' as 'my love' is redundant.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that person have education in the foreign country, so she has much more western style mind, is that right?And her expression of feeling is much more open minded, right?Therefore the word my love have not any mean, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its cultural connotations.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user fails to understand the cultural significance of the phrase '我的愛' and its meaning in the context of the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然沒有阿，這個字只是用來跟老朋友關心的用語。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user translates the phrase as 'No, there isn't', which does not capture the intended meaning of 'a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，我們只不過是同事而已，我們在工作上是同事。我離開兩天，她自然會想我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'We are partners at work.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'partners' is not accurately conveyed in the translation. It should be translated as '同事' instead of '只不過是同事而已'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the detail that the speaker was away for two days.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean because you took two days off, so your colleague worried about you. Without your assistance in the class, so she missed you, is that truth?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對這就是簡訊內容阿，簡訊本身沒有什麼。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the message being a text message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message is at eleven fifty five pm, january thirteen, 2012. It’s from the same cell phone.The detail of message is 「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」.Can you tell me what is the mean of the sentence?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這句話是因為說他想幫我表達這句中文的意思。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean she sent you this message because she want to help you with your assignment.Is that truth?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像他們說的，我現在正在完成一篇論文。因此我必須要完成十三個學分，我才能正式完成我的學位。那當然我必須要完成一些指定的作業...

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what’s your graduated school’s degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是英語教學。在這些課程裡面，有些是英語上的教學，有些是牽涉到文化的部份。

minor categories of cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user did not include any information about greetings or etiquette, which may be important in the context of culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
You mean that your have TESOL for your master degree, and there are some cross..related …….is that what your mean?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
我至少有三個課程關於文化還有溝通的部份。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'related to' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '關於文化還有溝通的部份' at the end of the sentence instead of after '有三個課程'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
In this course, what kind of assignment did this course provide you?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這堂課給每個學生的作業可能都不一樣。對我來說好了，我在台灣想要尋求一個英語教學的工作。為了要展現出我的足夠的能力可以勝任這個工作，因此我必須要有良好的中文能力。所以我有很多的作業都是中英翻譯的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the culture and communication courses in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '好了' (okay) in the wrong position in the sentence.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that since you want to teach english in Taiwan, so you have to get the English degree. And this degree required you to have competence of english and chinese. Is that right? So you have to finished some of the assignment for the class, and the context of this work is to translate these sentence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific assignments given in the course.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence structure should be 'So you have to finish some of the assignments for the class.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the assignments are for practicing translation, but the user's translation refers to them as 'the context of this work'.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
當然啦，我還被要求說要加強我的口說還有寫作。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'required' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '說' (speak) before the noun '口說' (speaking), resulting in incorrect word order.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So let’s back to the message, that is your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的我還記得那句話。當我看到那句中文時，我無法翻成英文。你也知道有些中文字對於外國人很難辨認。我需要一些幫助，所以我叫我的同事幫我。所以我請她翻完之後把答案傳給我。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added '所以我請她翻完之後把答案傳給我' (so I asked her to translate it and send me the answer)

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that you asked your colleague to translate that sentence and she will send the answer back to you, is that what you mean?In other word, this message is the answer of your assignment.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就只是我功課上的答案而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
And now we’ll show you the investigatory file from page fourteen to sixteen,please see all the message on these pages. Please check these messages. Is these message that she want to help you with your assignment?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊都是她為了要幫我完成作業而傳給我的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the messages being sent.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject before the verb in the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '她' (she) instead of '我' (I) in the translation.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So for your wife, you have the affair with your colleague Wan Tsai Yian. What’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我的太太真的想太多了。我知道她可能不太滿意我在家中沒有扮演支持上的角色。我想到的是說在我剛開始念書的時候，她從來沒有表現出支持我的意思。她根本就不想要幫我完成這個學業。如果她肯幫助我的話，那我根本就不需要問我的同事阿！我覺得她要為這些誤會負所有的責任。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, there seem to be some trouble between you and your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在剛開始結婚的時候，我們的確有一段甜蜜的時光。可是問題是在於我的工作。我想要再台灣教葡萄牙文，但我的工時並不穩定。然後我們的工作就變成我們吵架的理由。我們常常為了這件事情不停的吵架。她不相信我已經全力以赴了。她根本也不了解我我面臨了多艱困的處境。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, let’s back to the master degree course. When is your course begin? when do you graduate?Do you get your master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春天開始上課的。那是一個兩年的課程。我應該要在2012年的十二月就要完成了。我並沒有完成是因為說我還要工作，所以我沒有時間完成這些作業。就像我說的，我的太太並不支持我。我覺得我只能孤軍奮戰，自己去解決那些問題。我覺得我太受挫折，而且我也很累了。
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'the program' in 'I didn’t finish the program'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我在2010年春天開始上課的'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing period at the end of the sentence '我覺得我太受挫折，而且我也很累了'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean it’s a two year project program, and you didn’t finish it. Can you tell me why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有完成那些作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of 'course requirement' and translated it as '作業' which means 'homework'.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when is your last registration semester over?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the word order in the question

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後...是在2012年的秋天。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'semester' from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '在2012年的秋天' before the verb '註冊', resulting in incorrect word order.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So you mean that after 2011, december fifth, you should not have any assignment after your last registration date, is that right? But you and your colleague still send the message after six month.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding of the original text

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我已經完成了這些作業了，並不代表我不想繼續增進我的語文能力。就算我沒有拿到碩士學位，但是我還是想要繼續增進我的中文能力阿。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even though you didn’t finish that program, you still want to improve your language ability, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversing the word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為什麼我找我的同事幫忙。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '這就是為什麼' which is not present in the original text.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague play the role of a teacher for you.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'just' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是個助教，而且是個真心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我想要付她錢，但是被她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我想要付她錢' instead of '我想要她付錢'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did her send you message at midnight for your work? Is that a little bit beyond the relationship between the colleague?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我就說她是一個一個很支持我的朋友。她都用她自己的時間來幫我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '一個很支持我的朋友' instead of '一個一個很支持我的朋友'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach english in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'teach' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
對我還在那邊工作。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
So your colleague Wan Tsai Yian, did she still work there?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the name of the colleague, Wan Tsai Yian.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她還在那邊工作，不過我們也不再是夥伴的關係。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '不過我們不再是夥伴的關係。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any requirement for further investigation or the further evidence you want to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena Wan Tsai Yian, who works in Bo Yuan cram school as a witness. I want her to….. the relationship between her and defendant. And I want to ask her about the context in the message.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of what they want Wan Tsai Yian to testify about.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' after the name 'Wan Tsai Yian' instead of before it.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the verb 'want' instead of the correct verb 'subpoena' to indicate their intention to call Wan Tsai Yian as a witness.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'subpoena' instead of 'call' to indicate their intention to have Wan Tsai Yian testify in court.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide any context or details about the messages they want to ask Wan Tsai Yian about.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
For defendant, do you have any evidence which want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the 'plaintiff' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'defendant' and 'court' in the translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
 I’ve heard that cram school have do something for there relationship. And even the cram school asked Wan Tsai Yian to leave the job. I wonder we can ask the cram school about this thing.

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'have do' instead of 'have done'

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate for you? The situation is that your course is already ended at december fifth, 2012.There is no reason that you still doing your assignment. Furthermore, you and Wan Tsai Yian send the message after nine o’clock pm, it makes people suspect.Do you have evidence that may help you with your case?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect tense
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我覺得我找不到任何證據可以讓法庭幫我。就像我說的，我跟我同事之間的關係就是這麼簡單，我只是想要繼續增進我的中文能力而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the court set that at four thirty pm, june ninth 2012, we will arrange the court for questioning procedure. The plaintiff and defendant both have to come to the court at that day. If necessary, both side can have a lawyer, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'So the court set that at four thirty pm, june ninth 2012, we will arrange the court for questioning procedure.' The correct word order should be: 'So the court set that for questioning procedure at four thirty pm, june ninth 2012.'
omission or addition	omission of details	Omission of the year in the translation: 'june ninth 2012' should be 'june ninth 103'.

我明白。
Yes, I do.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of adultery case. The plaintiff Chen Yu-Hua filed the case. It’s mainly because her husband John Anderson had close interaction with his colleague in cram school. The plaintiff discovered come intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. Also her husband would make up reasons for working late and had tele- conference with his colleague Wang Tsai-Yen. The evidence the plaintiff collected has beyond coworkers’ relationship. Therefore, she filed the case. The defendant, you are suspected of adultery, what’s your plea?

Not guilty, of course.
我沒有罪
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In the preparatory procedure today, we are mainly going to talk about the details of the interaction between the defendant and his coworker. And the purpose is to clarify whether the defendant and his colleague’s interaction constitutes of adultery. Do both parties understand the procedure?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you married your husband? Do you have kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for four years and we don’t have a kid.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'We have been married for four years.'
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after 'married for four years' to separate the main clause from the dependent clause.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan. Four years ago, he just got to Taiwan and wanted to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker being the one who wanted to learn Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past few years, his job is Taiwan was mainly teaching Portuguese, right?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense 'was' to match the context of the past few years.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a teacher who taught Portuguese. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hours was not stable. Sometime, the period between jobs may be one or two months. So in order to get a more stable job, he decided to teach English. However, English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree; you mean he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '進修' as 'seeking an advanced degree' instead of 'taking further education'

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to get a degree about TESOL. He found a distance learning program online which was in California. Therefore, he didn’t have to go to the USA but could get a distant learning. So that after he finished all the courses, he could get the degree. His plain was that with this degree, he could get an English teaching job in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what kind of the relationship between your husband and the person he had an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school. The cram school arranges a partner-teaching system, which contains a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher. And she as her partner.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
Then how do you know they had affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word '外遇' (affair) in the translation.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I noticed that my husband often worked late in cram school. I’ve asked him many times, it was just an English cram school; why would he work so late? And he told me that he had to teach with his partner teacher so he has to cooperate with each other. At first, I trusted him. However, I discovered that he often got phone calls after he got home. And he never answered the phone in front of me; he would go to the study room to answer. This made me start to suspect him, so I checked his phone.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific reason why the husband works late in the cram school.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the critical context of the wife's suspicion and subsequent action of checking the husband's phone.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user made word order errors in several sentences.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So did you see any unusual thing in his phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
There was one number that often showed on his dialed record. So I went to check hos text message. After that I found that he texted with a woman nearly every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific information about the phone number and the content of the text messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
If it’s was text, then it not a big deal, right? Was the content suspectful?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'suspectful' does not accurately convey the meaning of '不宜' in the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
It’s okay if it was just normal text. However, he is a married man, how could he let a woman to send that kind of message to him. I have provided some of contents to the court. I think it’s in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了' as 'It's okay if it was just normal text.' The correct translation is 'If it was just a normal text, it would be fine.' The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢?' as 'how could he let a woman to send that kind of message to him.' The correct translation is 'How could he let the other person send such intimate words?' The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the information about providing some of the contents to the court, which is important context for understanding the situation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Let’s see page thirteen of the file. Defendant, please check the text content. Are these the text message from your phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對這是我手機裡的簡
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '對' (yes) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Based on these messages, I will ask you some questions. The first one was sent on at 9:50pm on thirty first in November from number 0958-932xxx, the content was “I really miss you, my love,”…..
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
恩,她是我同事 我記得那個時候我休了兩天假 她很擔心我 所以她才會傳這封簡訊給我 我同事是在美國受教育的 她的思想很開放 這是她說話跟表達的方式  至於{我的愛}只是我們對關心的人的稱謂
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after the introductory phrase 'As to'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'my love' as '{我的愛}' is incorrect. It should be translated as '親愛的' or '我愛的人'.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean the one who sent this was westernized because she studied in the United States, right? And she’s more opened in expressing her emotion? So the words ”my love” means nothing right?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
這是對老朋友的一種表達方式而已
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural meaning of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的 她擔心我啊 我們是工作夥伴 我兩天沒有去上班 她當然會想我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她當然會想我' instead of '她當然會我想'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean she sent this kind of message to you was just because you didn’t go to work for two days? Without your assistance in class, and she missed you? Is that all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning by adding the idea of the sender missing the recipient.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error by placing 'and she missed you' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'because you didn’t go to work for two days'.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對阿 就這樣啊 沒什麼大不了的
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'The message' which is a critical detail in the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, then the second text was sent at 11:55pm on January 13th in 2013 from the same cellphone, the content was 「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」, can you tell me what this meant
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這封簡訊給我是要教我中文作業要怎麼表達
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean the reason why she sent this to you was to help you with your assignment? What is that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太說的 我在進修 要得到學位的話我必須要休30個學分 而當然我就有一些作業跟練習

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what you are studying in your master program?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'master' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'studying' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我修的是英語教學 在這個學位中 有一部份是英語教學 也有文化語言能力的部分
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you are studying the degree of TESOL, and there are some courses about culture, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'some' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'right' at the end of the sentence instead of after the verb 'are studying', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對阿我記得至少三堂課都跟文化溝通有關
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of courses in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'related' before the subject 'courses' in their translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '溝通' (communication) instead of 'communication' in their translation.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So the so-called culture communication course would give you what kind of assignments?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'So' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'So' at the end of the sentence instead of the beginning.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這種課所給的作業因學生而異 拿我自己來說 我現在在台灣而且想要找一個英語教學的工作 為了要達到我必須要證明我有足夠的語言能力 所以我的作業很多都是中英文句子的轉換
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean because you plan to teach in Taiwan, so have to show your Chinese competent, right? So you have to do some assignment in the course, which contains the translation between Chinese and English, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the assignment, specifically that it involves translating sentences.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of the assignment, which is to prove their Chinese language ability for teaching in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence structure should be 'You mean you have to show your Chinese competence because you plan to teach in Taiwan, right?'

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對阿 我也需要加強我的口說及寫作能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So back to the previous sentence, this was your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿 我還記得這句 當我看到這個中文的時候 不知道英文怎麼多 你知道中文字對外國人來說很難辨別 我需要一點幫助 所以我才請我同事幫我 我叫他幫我翻譯然後把答案傳給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing punctuation mark in the translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation uses incorrect words.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean the condition at that time was that you gave the Chinese sentence to your co-worker and asked her to tell you in English, right? That is, the content in the text was just the answer for your assignment, righ
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對 這封簡訊就只是我作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '對' (to) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
And now please check page 14 to 16, the evidence one. Please check the content. Were these all because of your assignment?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對 所有的簡訊都是為了幫助我完成作業才傳的
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the messages being referred to.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, about the law suit which accuse you of having an affair with Wang Tsai-Yen, what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我老婆真的想太多了 我知道他對我負擔家計的程度感到不滿 我想讓法院知道的是 他對於我要進修沒有表示任何的支持 他不願意幫助我完成學業 如果他願意幫助我的話 我就不用請我同事來幫我了 我覺得他對於這些誤會應該要負全部的責任

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, there seems to be some unhappy things between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚的時候 真的很開心 但是問題是我的工作 我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文 可是卻沒有辦法獲得足夠的工作時數 所以我的工作就變成我們兩個之間的問題 我們為此一直吵架 他不相信我有努力 而且他對於我的挫折還有困境完全不了解

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, then back to the master program. When did you start it? Are you done with it? Did you get the degree yet?

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春天開始修這個學位 這是一個兩年的課程 我本來應該要在2012年12月完成 可是我沒有完成因為我還有工作所以沒有足夠的時間寫作業  就像我剛剛說過的 我老婆從來不支持我 我覺得在追求學位的路上很孤單 我就變得很累也很挫折
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'the program' in the translation of 'the degree'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我在2010年春天開始修這個學位'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	translated 'degree' as '學位' instead of '課程'
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	no specific error found

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean the course was supposed to a two-year program, and you didn’t finish it, why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
因為我沒有辦法完成所有的課程要求
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'couldn't' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when was the last registered-semester ended?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個註冊的學期是2101年秋天
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'fall 2012' as '2101年秋天' is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, if the last day of the semester was 5th December, 2012, there shouldn’t be any further assignments, right? However, the text between you and your colleague proceeded for 6 month after that, why is that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成學位也不代表我不想增進我的語文能力阿 就算我沒有拿到學位我也想要增進我的中文 所以我還是自己繼續念
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
minor categories of grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean despite the failing of the course, you still wanted to improve your Chinese ability, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對阿 所以我請我同事幫忙
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '同事' (colleague) at the end of the sentence instead of after '我' (I).

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague was just like your tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'role model'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只像我的家教 也是我真心的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有 我有跟他說過要付他錢 可是他拒絕
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有跟他說過要付他錢 可是他拒絕'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, then why would she send text to you at night when it was supposed to sleep? Doesn’t that do beyond the relationship between coworker?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original meaning

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以這是為什麼我會說他是一個很好的朋友 他拿自己的時間來教我中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以這是為什麼我會說他是一個很好的朋友，他拿自己的時間來教我中文。'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' in the translation is incorrect. It should be '她' to match the original text.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'English' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
對我還在那工作
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
So does she still work there, too?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague's name, Wang Caiyan.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
對阿 他也還在那邊工作 可是我們現在不是搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他也還在那邊工作，可是我們現在不是搭檔了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, does there any evidence you want to further investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena Wang Tsai-Yen who works at Bo-Yuan cram school as witness. And ask her to elaborate the relationship between them, and the background of those texts.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of contacting the defendant's colleague and the purpose of her testimony.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' after the object 'Wang Tsai-Yen', resulting in incorrect word order.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after the introductory phrase 'I want to'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'subpoena' instead of 'summon' to convey the idea of calling Wang Tsai-Yen as a witness.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there any evidence you want to course to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'tell' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'course' before the verb 'want', which is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'want to course'.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had taken some measures about the relationship between them. And I heard that the cram school tried to persuade her to quit the job. Is it possible to verify it to the cram school?

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'verify' instead of 'confirm'

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? The situation now is that your master program has ended, so it should not be taken as an excuse for the interaction between you and Wang Tsai-Yen. Especially, your interaction was always after 9pm, I think it suspectful. Do you have any evidence that may help you with your case?

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不出法院可以幫我偵查什麼耶 就像我之前說的 我們之間的互動是很單純的 我只是想要增進我的語言能力繼續學中文

是的我知道了

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, we mainly discuss the details about the intimate messages. That is mainly for to investigate there is an affair or not, that constitute adultery case. Do both of you understand?

我明白
 I understand.

I understand.
我明白。

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long do you marry to your husband? Do you have kid?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after 'Plaintiff'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'marry' should be 'married'.
semantic conversion	word choice	The word 'kid' should be 'children'.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I’ve married to my husband for 4 years but we don’t have kid.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'already' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry to your husband in Taiwan? Or other place?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that they met their husband in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'came' before the subject 'he', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'for teaching' instead of 'to teach', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Is his job teaching Portuguese for past years?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense to match the time frame mentioned in the original text.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
The time we just met, he was a Portuguese teacher. And he still kept teaching Portuguese when we just married. But there’s not many people want to learn Portuguese so his teaching hours was not stable. Sometime the period between jobs would be one or two months. To make the income more stable, he started to teach English. But English is not his mother tongue, he decided to take an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he wanted to seek an advanced degree, is that mean he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in the translation.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he need to get a TESOL degree. He found a distance learning from California, U.S. so that he doesn’t need to go to California, U.S. but get the degree by the distance learning program. His plan is to get the English teacher job by the American degree.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in cram school. They are partner. One is foreign teacher, one is mandarin teacher. The person he has an affair with is the mandarin teacher.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the cram school has arranged for a partnership between a Mandarin teacher and a foreign teacher.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the context that the person mentioned is having an affair with the Mandarin teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'One is a foreign teacher, and one is a Mandarin teacher.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'partner' instead of 'affair', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'know' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
What’s the unusual in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
There are usually the same number shows up in his phone book. I was so curious so I go check his messages. And I found out that he message with a woman every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the phone number and the frequency of the messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'There are usually the same number that shows up in his phone book.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'message' instead of 'text' to translate '簡訊'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
I don’t think text messages matter. Was there any unusual content?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If that just usual message, that is okay. But he is married, how can he have intimate messages with another woman? I’ve provided some text messages and I think it’s in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '很親密的字句' as 'intimate messages' instead of 'very intimate words or phrases'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of providing the text messages to the court, which is important context for understanding the situation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
In the file one, page thirteen. Here are some message content for the defendant. Are those the messages in your phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的這些都是我手機裡的簡訊。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '裡的簡訊' which is not present in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I’m going to ask you some questions for the messages. The first messages is 9:50 PM, November thirty-first, 2012, from number 0958932xxx to your cellphone. The content is “我真的很想你，我的愛。” What is that?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I really miss you, my love' as '我真的很想你，我的愛' is accurate and conveys the same meaning.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事傳給我的啊。我記得我那時候休了兩天假，她那時有點焦慮。所以她才發給我這樣的簡訊。我同事是在美國念過書所以她很開放，那是她表達的方式。至於我的愛這句話，這是我們稱呼我們所在乎的人的方式。
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of being concerned or worried
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of the colleague being educated in the US
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of the colleague being open-minded
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of 'my love' being a way to call people we care about

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean she text you because she was westernized for being educated in U.S.? She is more open minded to express, so “my love” doesn’t mean any special?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
沒啊這就只是好朋友老朋友之間互相表達我們很在乎對方。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '好朋友老朋友之間互相表達我們很在乎對方' does not capture the idea of a 'common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about former sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我講的 她有點擔心，因為我們是工作上的搭檔啊。當我兩天沒上班她當然會想念我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我講的' instead of '像我講的'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after '啊' in the translation. The correct punctuation should be '啊,'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'naturally' is not translated accurately. It should be translated as '當然' instead of '因為'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean you text you that kind of message just because you had two days off? She missed you because of without you in the class? Just that
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊就只是這樣啊。對啊就跟內容講的一樣啊這根本就沒甚麼。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the details mentioned in the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message is at 23:55 PM, January thirteenth, 2013, from the same number to your phone. The content is “我真的好希望你在我身邊，為什麼我們不能真正的在一起?” What does that mean? Why the content?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I want you by my side' as '我真的好希望你在我身邊' is incorrect. The correct translation should be '我希望你在我身邊'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'when can we be truly together?' as '為什麼我們不能真正的在一起?' is incorrect. The correct translation should be '我們什麼時候能真正在一起?'.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她之所以會傳給我這樣的簡訊主要是為了表達中文句子。這是我的作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed in the translation.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean she text you the message just for helping you the assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我老婆告訴庭上的。我開始了這個遠距教學程，在這遠距教學課程裡我得完成30個學分。自然，我需要完成一些功課與習題。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of attending a Master's program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在這遠距教學課程裡' (in this distance learning course) in the wrong position.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include any punctuation marks in the translation.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what is your master degree for?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'in' before 'what is your master degree for'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'is' before the subject 'your master degree', which is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程主要是英語教學。在課程裡，大部分是英語教學的部分，其他則是文化及語言能力相關。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you mean you get the TESOL degree, but there’re some courses about cross-culture communication?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
我記得大概有三棵是關於跨文化溝通課程。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'courses' after the number 'three' instead of before it.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '棵' which means 'trees' instead of '門' which means 'courses'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What’s the assignment in cross-culture communication courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cross' in 'cross-culture communication courses'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'assignment' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'is'.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
每個學生的作業都不太一樣，拿我舉例來說，我人在台灣，尋求教師資格，為了顯示我有這個這個能力勝任教師，所以有很多是關於中英語句的翻譯轉換。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating 'culture and communication'

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean to get the degree you have to prove that you have Chinese competence, so you have to complete the assignment in the course. And the assignment is to translate sentences? Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific assignments given in the course.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order in the sentence 'You mean to get the degree you have to prove that you have Chinese competence'. The correct word order should be 'You mean you have to prove that you have Chinese competence to get the degree'.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對啊當然，而且我還得加強我的說和寫的能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'required' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '還' (also) before the verb '得' (must), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay let’s back to the former sentence, you said that is your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對啊我還記得那句，當我知道中文句子時，我不知道如何變成英文。你懂的，有些中文對外國人而言實在很難分辨差別。我實在需要幫忙所以我找了我的同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯並傳簡訊給我。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added 'and sent me the answer'
minor categories of grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer'

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Your mean you told your colleague that Chinese sentence so she text it into English and send it to you? That’s only the answer to your assignment
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text, specifically the part about asking the colleague for the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence structure should be 'Did you mean to say that you asked your colleague to translate that Chinese sentence into English and she sent it to you as a text message? Is this just the answer to your assignment?'

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就真的只是作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Messages in file one, page 14 to 16. Please have a look. Are those message also the help for your assignment?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的所有簡訊都是為了完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So what’s your explanation for your wife said that you have an affair with your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'Tsai-Yen Wang' instead of '王彩燕'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	translating '王彩燕' as 'Tsai-Yen Wang'

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了。我知道她對於我對家計的幫助一直很不滿意。我必須告訴庭上，從一開始修這門課，她就沒表現任何想支持我的意思。她根本就不想幫助我完成這個學位，如果她表現出她有點想幫助我的樣子，我就不會想請我同事幫助我。我覺得這一切的誤會都得怪她。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
omission or addition	omission of details	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
As you just said, there are some unhappy between you and your wife?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
一開始我們剛結婚時的確還滿快樂的，但問題在於我的工作。我試著在台灣交葡萄牙語但我的工時實在太不穩定了。所以我的工作成為我們的大問題，我們為了這個問題一直爭吵，她一直不相信我的努力。我也沒辦法讓她明白我的艱困處境及我的沮喪。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, let’s back to the degree issue. When did your advanced degree start? Did that finished? Did you get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我大概是2010年春天開始的，這是兩年期的課程。我應該在2012年的12月完成這門課程。但我並沒有如期完成因為我有兼職要做而且我也沒有完成這門課的作業。就像我講的，我老婆一點都不想幫
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	not addressing the cultural norms of support

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You said that program is for two years, but you didn’t complete, why?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the reason for not completing the program.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我無法完成所有課程的要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'couldn't' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '所有' (all) before '課程' (courses) instead of after, resulting in incorrect word order.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When does the last semester you registered complete?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊在學的最後一個學期事2012年的秋季。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'registration' from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the year '2012' before the phrase 'fall semester' instead of after.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
 If what you said is true, your semester finished on December fifth, 2012, that you would not have any assignment after that semester, right? But the text messages between

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我雖然沒有完成這門課程，但不代表我就不想精進我的語言能力。就算我沒有得到我的學位，我還是想要我的中文能力進步，所以我持續自行學習。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
minor categories of grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
minor categories of grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect tense
minor categories of grammar and structure	pronoun errors	incorrect pronoun usage
minor categories of grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean though you didn’t complete the degree, you still want to improve your language competence to make your Chinese more fluently?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
是的這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫我。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase 'Yes' at the beginning of the sentence, which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '是的' (Yes) at the beginning of the sentence, which is not the correct word order in English.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the position that your colleague is your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅是家教也是我的好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有啊我原本想付錢給她但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我原本想付錢給她但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her why she still text you in midnight the bed time for answering your questions? Don’t you think that is beyond the co-worker relationship
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of not paying the person in question.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'pay' after the subject 'you' instead of before.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '超過了一個同事應該做的事情' as 'beyond the co-worker relationship' instead of 'beyond what a colleague should do'.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我剛剛講過的，她是一個非常支持我的好朋友。她用她自己的時間幫助我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我剛剛講過的，她是一個非常支持我的好朋友。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific subject of teaching, which is English.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的我仍在那邊任教。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'teaching' in their translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is the co-worker, Tsai-Yen Wang still working there, too?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the name of the co-worker, Tsai-Yen Wang.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她仍在那邊工作但我們不再是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們不再是搭檔了' instead of '但我們不再是了搭檔'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any person you want to subpoena or investigate any further evidence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena Tsai-Yen Wang, who was the co-worker in BoYuan cram school to clarify the relationship between the defendant and those messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the witness's role as a witness and the purpose of her testimony.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'to clarify the relationship between the defendant and those messages' at the end of the sentence instead of immediately after the mention of the witness's name.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, do you want the court to investigate for you
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of what the plaintiff wants the court to investigate.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
 I’ve heard that cram school took some action for the relationship between my husband and her. Also I heard the cram school tried to persuade Tsai-Yen Wang to quit. Can we modify it from the cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'modify' instead of 'verify'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of 'cram school'

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
 Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you? The situation is, your degree finished on December fifth, 2012. You don’t have any reason to explain the intimate messages between you and Miss Wang. Especially, the message communication is mainly after 9PM, it’s very doubtful. Do you have any evidence which can help you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the year in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the year at the end of the sentence instead of after the mention of the degree.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '101年' as '2012' instead of '2013'.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我覺得我的行為已經夠可以表現出我的清白了。就像我說的，我跟我同事間的簡訊來往是非常單純的。我只是想增進我的中文能力並持續的學中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase '已經夠可以表現出我的清白了', where the verb '表現' should come before the object '我的清白'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation incorrectly translates 'reason for the communication between my colleague and me' as '我跟我同事間的簡訊來往', which means 'text message exchange between my colleague and me', instead of '行為' which means 'behavior'.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next date will be set at 4:30PM June ninth, 2014, for the examination procedure. Plaintiff, defendant should show up. If it’s neccesarily, both of you can have a lawyer. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The next date will be set at 4:30PM June ninth, 2014, for the examination procedure.' The correct word order should be: 'The examination procedure will take place on June ninth, 2014, at 4:30 PM.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence: 'The next date will be set at 4:30PM June ninth, 2014, for the examination procedure.' The correct tense should be: 'The next hearing will take place at 4:30 PM on June ninth, 2014, for the examination procedure.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing comma after '4:30PM' in the sentence: 'The next date will be set at 4:30PM June ninth, 2014, for the examination procedure.' The correct punctuation should be: 'The next date will be set at 4:30 PM, June ninth, 2014, for the examination procedure.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence: 'If it’s neccesarily, both of you can have a lawyer.' The correct word choice should be: 'If necessary, both of you can have a lawyer.'

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are her for the preparation of adultery case. The plaintiff, yu wha chen sued the case. The main reason is that her husband John Anderston has intimate messages with his colleague in cram school. The plaintiff checks her husband’ cell phone and found that there are some intimate messages. Moreover, her husband often makes up reasons for working and has tele-conferencing with his colleague chia en Wang. The information collected by the plaintiff is beyond the co-workers’ relationship. So she sued the case. Defendant, your wife sued you of adultery case, what‘s your plea?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long did you marry your husband? Do you have any child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun 'you' should be capitalized.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I have been married him for 4 years, we don’t have any child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I have been married to him for 4 years.'
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	The period at the end of the sentence is missing.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The correct word order is 'I have been married to him for 4 years.'

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you and your husband marry in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
My husband and I have known each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan for the purpose of teaching Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is also from Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'My husband and I' after the verb 'have known each other', which is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '想要' as 'for the purpose of', which is not an accurate translation.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
For the past few years, is his job of teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we just met, he is a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he still teaches Portuguese. But there are few people learning Portuguese, his teaching hours are unstable. Sometimes, there is one or two months which is a period between jobs. In order to reach a stable financial status, he wants to start to teach English. But his mother tongue is not English, he decided to seek advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree, did you mean that he wants to further study in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly interpreted '進修' as 'further study' instead of 'seek an advanced degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he needs to get some degrees of teaching English. He found a distance learning program from California on internet.  He can finish his course requirement by distance learning and he doesn’t need to go to America. After he finished the entire course, he can get the master degree. His plan is to get this degree of American course, and he can teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleague in cram school. The cram school arranges them to be the partner. My husband partner with her in teaching.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'partner' should agree with the subject 'My husband' in number.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'My husband partner with her in teaching' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I just noticed that my husband often extra-work in cram school. I have asked him several times that if it is an English cram school, did you really need to extra-work. He told me that because he needs to partner with the Chinese teacher in English teaching, he has to stay in cram school late for extra work. At t he beginning, I didn’t suspect him. But later I found out that after he came back home, he often pick some phone calls. After he picks up phone call, he didn’t talk on the phone in front of me, and go to the study room to talk with somebody. That makes me suspect him of some affairs, so I check his phone book.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find any problems in cell phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'unusual' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his record, I saw the same number on the phone book. I am curious about who she or he is, I check his messages. After I check his messages, I found out that he send the messages with the same woman almost every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the phone number and the content of the messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user incorrectly placed the pronoun 'she or he' before the verb 'is'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'phone book' instead of 'record' to refer to the communication history.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
If they are only sending messages, is that any problems or is the detail unusual?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they are the normal messages, that is fine. He is married, how can he make her send some intimated messages. I provide the court some messages on the phone. It should be in the fold.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'intimated' as 'intimate'

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please show the page 13. There are some messages, defendant please check the messages. Are these the detail in your cell phone messages?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的,這些是我的手機簡訊

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I am going to ask you some questions based on these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50 p.m on November 31th ,2012. It was sent by 0958-932-***. The text is that I really fix your love. What does that mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'miss' as 'fix'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'I really fix your love'

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那是從我同事傳的,我記得我請兩天假,他有點擔心我.這就是為什麼他傳這簡訊給我.我的同事是在美國受教似的,所以他非常開放.這是他說話跟表達的方式,至於愛是他表達對我的關心而以.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '愛' is translated as 'love' instead of 'care'.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The cultural meaning of '愛' as used in this context is not accurately translated.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Did you mean that the sender is educated in America, so she is westernized, right? She expresses the feelings open-minded right? So the meaning of my love is nothing, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'nothing' instead of 'my love'.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然沒有阿,這是兩個很好的朋友表達關心的方式
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, while the user's translation suggests that it is a way for friends to express concern.

那她前面那句呢？
What about the last two sentences she just mentioned?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的他只是很擔心我,我們是工作上的同事.我請假兩天.他當然會擔心我.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The subject and verb should be in the correct order.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean that because you are two day off, your colleague worry about you, she send the message, right? Because she didn’t partner with you in English teaching, she miss you, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the colleague misses the user because they didn't partner in English teaching.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in several places.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對那就是內容阿,根本沒有什麼
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the message being 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent at 11:55p.m January 13th .2012. it is sent by the same cell phone. The detail is that I want you by my side, when can we be truly together? Can you tell me why do you have that kind of message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他寫這句話是想要我知道中文的意思
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed in the translation.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Did you mean that she sent the messages for helping you finish your homework?

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛說的,我正在上一些課。我必須要完成30哥學分才算是結束。當然我就必須要完成一些功課阿。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of attending a Master's program and the requirement of completing assignments and exercises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '就像我太太剛剛說的' (as my wife has informed) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include any punctuation marks to separate the sentences.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain that what did you learn in Master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是英語教學，在那樣的課程裡，有些是英文教學的課程，有些是文化以及語言表達的課程。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	not accurately translating the cultural context

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you mean that you are getting the master degree of TESOL. There are some cultural and communication courses, right
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'getting' in the translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'of TESOL' in the translation.

omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'and communication' in the translation.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in the translation.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對阿，我記得至少有三堂課跟文化與溝通課程有關係的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'courses' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'three'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '課程' which means 'curriculum' instead of 'courses'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What’s your assignment of this kind of course you mentioned?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這堂課的功課是根據每個學生不同而定的，拿我來說，我在台灣是想尋求一個應予教學的學位，為了拿到這個學位，跟足夠的語言能力，我必須知道如何表達。所以我有很多功課是中文英文之間的翻譯功課。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Did you mean that you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have get some courses to prove that you have the Chinese language competence, right? So you have to finish the assignment in the courses which is sentences translation, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the assignment, specifically that it involves translating sentences.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context that the assignment is part of a master's course and is meant to demonstrate Chinese language proficiency.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'So you have to finish the assignment in the courses, which is sentence translation, right?'

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
當然阿，我有時後還必須要潤飾我的作文還有口說能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Then we go back to the sentence we just mention. Is this sentence your homework?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我還記得這句話。當我拿到這句中文的時候，我不知怎麼翻。你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說項天書一樣。我需要一些幫忙，所以請我同事幫忙。我告訴他我需要幫忙，所以請他幫我翻譯然後回傳答案給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a lack of punctuation in the translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation uses incorrect words that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The translation does not accurately interpret the difficulty of recognizing Chinese characters for foreigners.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that your colleague translated the sentence into Chinese and send it back to you, is that what you mean? That is to say, the detail of message is just assignment, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是我的功課罷了。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now we are going to show you that the details on page14 to 16. Please check the content. Is that just because you need to finish your homework, you ask your colleague for help, right?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，所有的簡訊都是為了完成我的功課。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the messages being referred to.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
For your wife suspect you of having affair with yu chia Wang, what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's suspicion in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'your wife' after the verb 'suspect' instead of before it.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a question mark at the end of the sentence.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的是想太多了，我知道他對我沒辦法養一個家不是很滿意。我想告訴法庭的是，在我開始想學課程的時候，他沒有給我任何支持。他並沒有給我任何幫助完成學業。如果他可以給我多一點支持或幫助的話，我就不需要問我同事拉。我覺得他需要為所有的誤會負責。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you just said, is there any quarrel between you and your wife?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在結婚一開始的時候，我們當然過得很開心阿。問題在於….。我試著想要在台灣交葡萄牙文，但教課十束真的很不穩定。我的工作問題就變成我們的大問題。我們常常為了這件事在吵架。他根本不相信我其實進了我最大的努力。我沒辦法讓他知道我所面臨的挫折跟處境。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok, let’s back to the master degree courses you just mentioned. When did you start your courses? Did you finish the course and get the degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the master degree courses.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春天開始。他是兩年的課程。我應該是在2012年12月就要完成我的課程。我沒有修完課程，因為我還要打工兼職。而且我沒有時間作作業。就像我太太說的，我太太一直都不是很支持我做這件事，我覺得我是一個人為了學業在奮鬥。我覺得我很累而且很綽折。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that the course is two year period, and you didn’t finish the course, can you tell me why?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the reason for not finishing the course.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有完成課業的要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When did the semester end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個學期是在2012年的秋天。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'registration' from the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the year '2012' before the phrase '的秋天', which is incorrect in Chinese.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
Based on what you just said, your semester ended on December 12th ,2012. You should not any assignment after the semester, right? But you and your colleague still send the messages to each other for six months after the semester ended. Can you tell me why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我或許是沒有完成學業，但不代表我不想增進我的語言能力。就算我沒有完成學業，沒有拿到碩士學位，我還是想增進我的能力，所以我才繼續傳簡訊。

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Did you mean that even though you didn’t finish your master degree, you still want to improve your language ability, right?

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為什麼要找我同事幫忙。

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
Did you mean that your colleague is like your tutor, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague being a tutor.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是一個家教，而且他是一個很好的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her money?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you pay her money?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
我本來要付錢給他，可是他拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The subject and object should be switched.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you don’t pay her money, why did she still send the messages at midnight for helping you answer the question? Is that beyond the co-workers relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我說的，他是一個非常支持我的朋友。他總會用他自己的時間教我中文。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'she' was translated as '他' (he) instead of '她' (she).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'supportive' was translated as '支持' (support) instead of '幫助' (help).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of 'using her own time' was reversed in the translation.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any evidence need to investigate or subpoena any witness?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to sopena the colleague, working for the bo yun cram school, cia yun Wang as witness to the court. I want to ask her why she sends these messages and the purpose of doing so.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical details of the colleague's name and position.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'sopena' before the object 'the colleague', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'sopena' instead of 'subpoena', which is the correct term for summoning a witness to court.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'Plaintiff' and 'do you have any evidence' in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school takes some actions to solve the relationship between them. They try to encourage the colleague to quit the job. I want to know if the court asks the cram school to prove that.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the queen's name, which is essential for understanding the context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'to quit the job' after 'the colleague', resulting in a word order error.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user translated '女王彩燕' as 'colleague' instead of 'Queen Caiyan', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? The situation is that your master degree has ended on December 5th .2012. There is no reason for you to explain the interaction of you and your colleague; especially you often send the messages after 9 o’clock. That’s really wear. Do you have any evidence to prove your innocence

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有任何希望法庭替我調查的證據。就像我說的，我跟我同事傳簡訊的理由非常簡單。我只想增進我的語言能力而且繼續學中文。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today, we are here for the preparation procedure for the case of adultery. The defendant, YuHua Chen filed this case. She filed this case mainly because her husband, John Anderston, has the intimate relationship with his co-worker in the cram school. She found some intimate message in her husband’s cell phone. Moreover, her husband often makes up reasons for working so he can have the time with his co-worker, Cai Yan Wang. The defendant searched the message between her husband and the colleague is not the normal relationship about friends. As a result, the defendant filed this case. Plaintiff, your wife sued you with the crime of adultery, what do you have to say?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, defendant, how long has you married with your husband? Do you have any kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after 'defendant'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'defendant' is not appropriate in this context. '告訴人' should be translated as 'complainant' or 'plaintiff'.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years and we do not have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or in other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We knew each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and he mainly what to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject 'I' in the second sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'what' before 'to teach Portuguese', which is incorrect. It should be 'wanted to teach Portuguese'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past few years, did the husband teach Portuguese in Taiwan, is this his job?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the husband in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'the husband' after the verb 'teach' instead of before it.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first knew each other, he was the Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not quite popular in Taiwan so the teaching hours of my husband is not very much. And there might be the period between two jobs in one to two months. Then, because he wanted to have the more concrete salaries so he started teaching English. However, he is not a native speaker of English so he seeks for advance degree in Taiwan.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he decided to have the advanced degree, do you mean that he want to have a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '進修' as 'advanced degree' instead of 'further education'

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So, what is the relationship between your husband and the person he had an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are the co-worker in the cram school. In that cram school, they arranged a Chinese teacher to partner with the foreign teacher. And that woman is my husband’s partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'my husband's partner' does not match the original meaning of 'his classmate'.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know there is an affair between them?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'know' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I just noticed that my husband often stay in the cram school for extra working. I asked my husband many times why you have to work extra time because it is just an English cram school. He told me that because he had to partner with the Chinese teacher, they have to communicate many details. At first, I really didn’t suspect him; however, I found that he often got some calls after he returned home. When he got the phone call, he didn’t get it in front of me and he even went to the study room to pick the phone call. Then, I was doubtful for it so I check his cell phone.

semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating '溝通的地方' as 'communication needs'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating '查看了他的手機' as 'checked his cell phone'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So, did you find some unusual message in the cell phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In the records, I found the same number so I was very curious and I go to check his message box. After my checking, I found that my husband send message to the same woman almost every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
I think the message is acceptable, is there any unappropriated words?
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing question mark
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect interpretation of 'acceptable'

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it is just the normal language then I can just ignore it. However, my husband is married, how could he let that woman send some intimate to him? I provide some intimate records to the court, I think they are in the investigate file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '普通的簡訊' as 'normal language' instead of 'normal text messages'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '已婚的人' as 'married' instead of 'married man'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing the intimate records to the court.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the mention of the intimate records being in the investigate file.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please check the investigate file one page thirteen. Plaintiff, please read it, here are some messages from your cell phone. Are these messages from your cell phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
沒錯，這是我手機上的簡訊。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I want to ask you some questions about the message. The first message was sent from number 0958-932-XXX, and this message was sent at nine-fifty p.m. November twelve, 2012. And the content is “I really miss you, my love,” What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
恩這是我一個同事傳給我的，我記得我那時請了兩天的假，她有點擔心我的狀況，所以她才傳給我這個簡訊。我同事在美國讀過書所以她也比較開放。她就是這樣子講話來表達自己的情感的。至於那句”my love”，那只是我們叫彼此之間的方式罷了。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that because your co-work has ever received education in America so she might be westernized? So…she might be open-mind to express her thoughts? So, as to “my love”, there isn’t any meaning behind it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its cultural connotations.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user fails to understand the cultural significance of the phrase '我的愛' and its implications in the context.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
不是啊，那就只是一個詞來稱呼好朋友罷了。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation simply states that it is a term used to refer to good friends.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the prior sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛說的啊，她很擔心我，我們又是工作上的搭檔。當我請了兩天的假，她當然會很想我啊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So the co-work sent to such a message only because you had two day off for the work? Without your assistance of teaching, she miss you? That’s all?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed in the translation.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，就這樣子而已，那簡訊沒什麼啦。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in the translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Ok, let’s see the next text message, also sent from the same cell phone, sent at nine fifty p.m. January thirteenth 2013. The content is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” How about this message? Why did she send such message to you?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '23點55分' as 'nine fifty p.m.' instead of '11:55 p.m.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '中華民國102年1月13日' as 'January thirteenth 2013' instead of 'January 13th, 2013 in the Republic of China (Taiwan) calendar'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '手機' as 'cell phone' instead of 'mobile phone'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '訊息內容' as 'content' instead of 'message content'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '什麼意思' as 'How about this message?' instead of 'What does this sentence mean?'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？' as 'Why did she send such message to you?' instead of 'Why does it have this content?'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這簡訊給我是要教我怎麼樣寫我中文課的一個作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她傳這簡訊給我' instead of '她傳這簡訊給我是'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the information that the message is about expressing a Chinese sentence in the assignment.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Do you mean that your co-worker send you such a text message is to help your homework?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of the original text

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛說的，我正在接受碩士的進修課程。在那個課程中，我必須要修完30個學分才能得到這個學位，那當然啊，我必須要完成指定的作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you explain that what kind of education are you receiving now?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'now' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'that' after the verb 'explain', which is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位是英語教學，這個課程一部分是在上英語教學，而其他部分主要是在上有關文化和溝通方面的事物。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
Do you mean that you are receiving for the English teaching master degree but there is some culture communication programs in that case?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得至少有3個學分和文化溝通有關吧。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of courses in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '至少有3個學分' (at least 3 credits) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '我記得' (I remember).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '學分' (credits) instead of '課程' (courses) in their translation.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What kinds of assignments are given for the culture and communication?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
文化溝通課程的作業是因人而異的，舉我的例子來說，我在台灣然後我又想當一位英文老師，為了成為英文老師，我必須有足夠的中文能力，因此我的作業大多是和中英文翻譯有關。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Do you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, this program ask you to show the good Chinese competence? As a result, you have to finish the assignments given by the program, and the assignments are about translations.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific assignments being given.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context of the assignments being related to proving Chinese language proficiency.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'ask' instead of 'asks' to match the subject 'program'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used 'want' instead of 'wants' to match the present tense of the sentence.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'good' instead of 'sufficient' to accurately convey the meaning of '一定的'.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，我也被要求要訓練好我的口說和寫作的能力。

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, let’s go back to the words you said, is this your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對啊沒錯，我記得那句話，當我拿到這份英文作業時，我不知道怎樣用英文表達，你也知道，對外國人來說，中文字是很難的，我需要幫助所以我請我的同事來幫我。我請她幫我翻譯之後再傳簡訊告訴我。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Because you ask your co-worker to translate, she sent you the Chinese answer. Is this what you mean? That is to say, the message is only the answer to the assignment, do you mean this?

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對啦，那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now, we check the investigate file one page fourteen to sixteen, please read it. Did your co-worker send you all these messages only to help you with your assignment?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific request for the court interpreter to read the investigate file pages 14 to 16.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'check' before the subject 'we', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '偵卷' as 'investigate file' instead of 'investigation file'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user neglected to translate '簡訊' as 'text messages'.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，所有簡訊都只是要完成我的作業

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
How do you explain about your wife’s suing that there is the unusual relationship between you and your co-worker, Cai Yan Wang?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's accusation in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'your wife' after the verb 'suing', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'unusual relationship' instead of 'affair', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的是想太多了，我知道她一直對我沒辦法養這個家一直很不滿意，我希望法院知道的是，我太太在我開始進修的期間從來沒有支持過我，她根本不想幫助我，然後讓我得到這個學位，如果她願意幫助我的話，我就不會去找我的同事來幫我了，我覺得她才應該因為這些誤解來被譴責。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you just say, it seems that there are some unpleasant relationship between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們剛結婚時，我們的確過得很愉快，但問題在於我的工作，我想在台灣教葡萄牙語但是工作卻不穩定，於是，我的工作問題成為我們兩個之間不佳關係的導火線，我們因為我工作的問題已經吵架很多次了。她不相信我已經盡力了，她也不能理解我所遇到的沮喪或是困難。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So, let’s go back to the master degree you just mentioned. When did your master degree start, did your master degree finish, did you get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春天開始上這個課，這是兩年的課程，我應該在2012年12月得到學位，我沒有得到學位是因為我必須兼職而我沒有時間好好寫我得作業。就像我剛剛說的，我太太對我沒有很支持，我覺得我修這個課的時侯都只是靠自己的努力。我覺得很累也很難過。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
Since the course is a two-year course, why didn’t you finish this course?

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成課程的要求。

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When did the last registration finish?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一次註冊的時間是2012年秋天。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added unnecessary information

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If what you just said are true, then after your last semester of registration, which was on December twelve, 2012, so, after this date, you should not have any assignments, right? But the messages between you and your co-worker were keep send even after six months.

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'December twelve, 2012' instead of 'December 5, 101'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of '結束日期' as 'registration' instead of 'end date'

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然我沒有修完碩士課程但這並不代表說我不想要繼續增強我的中文能力。雖然我沒有修完課程，但是我還是想要繼續自學增強我的中文能力。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of 'failed the program'
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	adding unnecessary repetition

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Even though you didn’t finish the course, you still want to improve your Chinese competence and make your Chinese more fluently? Do you mean this?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
沒錯，所以我才請我同事幫我的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your co-worker played as your tutor for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'private tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅是我的家教也是我的好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾提議要付薪水給她但她婉拒了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾提議付薪水給她，但她婉拒了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she send you such a message at the midnight, the time people should be sleeping, why did she pay so much effort to help you? Is this kind of helping over the relationship between co-workers?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by suggesting that the person sending the message is helping the user, while the original text implies that the person is responding to the user's question despite not being paid.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我說的啊，她是很願意幫助我的人，她花盡所有的時間來教導我中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是很願意幫助我的人' instead of '就像我說的啊，她是很願意幫助我的人'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of using her own time to help learn Chinese. The correct translation should include '她花盡所有的時間來教導我中文'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach at that cram school now?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
對我還在那工作。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' from the translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
How about your co-worker? Did she still work there?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the co-worker's name, which is a critical detail.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那工作和我們沒有再一起教課了。

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutors, is there any evidence you want to investigate or witness you want to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena the co-worker who works at the 伯元cram school, whom is Cai Yan Wang, I want her to come here as the witness. I want to her to come here and explain the relationship between her and the plaintiff, also, I want to hear her explanations about the background of those messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	incorrect use of 'whom'

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Defendant, do you have any further evidence that you want the court to help you investigate?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the 'Defendant' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Defendant' after the verb 'do' instead of before it.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has some action about the relationship between my husband and the co-worker. The cram school also tried to persuade the woman to quit the job. I want to know if the court can confirm this issue or not.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific relationship between the husband and the co-worker.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the action taken by the cram school is related to the husband and the co-worker's relationship.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase 'I want to know if the court can confirm this issue or not.' which is not present in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Plaintiff, do you have anything you want the court to help you investigate? Your course has already finished on November fifth 2012. Actually, you do not have the reasons to have the action between you and your co-worker because your course has already finished. And the interactions between both parties’ messages are sent after nine p.m. and it is quite suspectful. Do you have any evidence which may help you with your case?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect tense
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我現在沒有想到任何法院可以幫助我調查的證據，就像我剛剛說的，我和同事之間的互動都沒什麼，我只是想要增進我的語言能力並且持續不斷的學中文。

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court date will be set at four thirty p.m. June ninth 2014, we will meet here for the preparation for witness. Both parties please come here on at date. If it is necessary, you can have your lawyer.

是的我瞭解

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today, here we are for the preparatory procedure for case of adultery. The plaintiff , Wu-Wha Chen, accused this case. The reason is that her husband, John Anderston, goes too close to his academic school co-worker. The plaintiff found some intimate messages in the defendant’s mobile phone. Further, the defendant will have more work after the job and he also had tele-conferencing with Cai Yan Wang after the work. The content that the plaintiff collected is beyond the co-worker’s relationship in this case. As a result, the plaintiff has this case. The defendant, what’s your plea that your wife thinks you have an affair.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
The main purpose of today’s preparatory procedure is that we want to know the details that the defendant connects with the woman. The purpose is that we want to know if the defendant has the adultery with his co-worker. Do both parties know the procedure?

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'met up' instead of 'met' which changes the meaning slightly.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Did he teach Portuguese as work in the past few years?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did he teach Portuguese as work in the past few years?'

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
In the beginning, he was a Portuguese teacher when we first met. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan so his teach hour is not stable. Sometimes, he has two months as a period between jobs. Later, in order to have a stable work, he tries to teach English. But his mother tongue is not English, so he wants to seek an advantage degree for English.

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'advantage degree' instead of 'advanced degree'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You said that he wants to seek an advantage degree. Is that mean he wants to have a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	seek an advantage degree

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he wants to get the degree about teaching English. He finds a distance learning program from California, America on the Internet. He can use the way of on-line learning instead of going to America to finish his learning. So that after he gets every credit, he can finish his graduate degree. His plan is: because his graduate degree, he can find some jobs about teaching English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'because his graduate degree' should be 'because of his graduate degree'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the detail that the distance learning program is offered by a university in California
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the detail that the distance learning program is for teaching English
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the detail that the distance learning program is a graduate program
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the detail that the distance learning program is completed through correspondence
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the detail that the degree is a master's degree

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-worker in cram school. The cram school has Chinese teachers and English teachers. So the woman partners with my husband. She is a Chinese teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, resulting in an incomplete translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user did not follow the correct word order in the translation.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
In the beginning, I found my husband often stayed in the cram school late. I asked for several times that why he needed work more because it is just a cram school. He told me that because he needed to partner with Chinese teacher so he needed to communicate with Chinese teacher frequently. I didn’t doubt him in the beginning. But later I found he had some phone calls after he came home. He never answers the phone in front of my face. He just went to the study room to answer the phone call. What I said made me feel confused and I try to check his phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you see something unusual in his mobile phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'his' and 'mobile phone' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
His calling record showed a number that frequently shown on the phone. I was very curious and I tried to search his messages. After I searched, I found that he contacted with a woman almost everyday.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the phone number and the content of the messages.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide any context or background information about the situation.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Just the text messages is ok I think. Is there any unusual message, unusual word in the message?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If the message is normal, that’s ok. But he is a person who got married, how can he deliver intimate messages. Previously I provided some contents of the messages. I think they are n the files of the court.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '讓對方發一些很親密的字句' as 'deliver intimate messages', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court, which is important context for understanding the situation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
The investigatory file, page thirteen. There are several contents of the messages. Defendant, please check them. Are they the messages from your mobile phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是，他們是我手機裡的簡訊內容。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'message' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I want to ask you some questions according to the messages. The first message is come from the phone number, 0958932xxx, and the date is 9:50 pm, November 31st in 2012. The context is that: 我真的很喜歡你，我的愛人。 What that mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	喜歡 (like) was translated as miss
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The original text does not mention missing or leaving out critical context

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那我一個同事傳的，我記得那天我兩天休假，她有點擔心，這就是為什麼她傳給我這個簡訊。我的同事是在美國受教育的，她的心胸比較開闊。那是她說話已集展現自我的方式。說「我的愛人」那是我們關心在乎的人的方式。
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of taking two days off from work
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of colleague being concerned or worried
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of colleague being educated in the US
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of colleague being open-minded
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of 'my love' being a way to refer to people we care about

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You meant the person who sent you this message stayed in foreign country before so that she was westernized. And her expression for her feeling is more open so the words “my love” don’t mean other meaning, right?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿，那在很重視彼此的平常的朋友裡是很常見的字。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'friends who care a lot for each other' does not capture the same level of familiarity and closeness as the original expression.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我所說的，她只是擔心我，我們是工作上的同事。我那兩天請假的時候她真的很想我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'naturally' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You meant the woman delivered this message is because you didn’t work for two days? Is that right? Because she didn’t have your cooperation in the class so she missed you? Is that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
沒錯那就是整個內容阿，這簡訊沒什麼大不了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in the translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message, which is delivered from the same mobile phone numbers, is delivered at 11:45 pm, on January thirteen in 2013. the message is that: 我真的很想跟你在一起，我們什麼時候才能做到呢?我們何時才能在一起呢? What the sentence mean? Why do you have such a message in your mobile phone?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她告訴我這個句子是因為她想告訴我怎麼樣在中文裡表達這個意思。因為這個是在我的作業裡面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You said that the woman delivered this message to you is because she wants to help you with your assignment. What is that meant?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就是有一個英語教學的時候，我老婆在打這場官司的時候。在那個課程裡我需要得到三十學分，這樣我才能完成我的學程。所以我要完成一些作業和課業上的功課。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Please explain your graduate degree. What are doing in the program?

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的計畫是英語教學。在那個課程裡有些部分事關於英語教學的部分，有些是有文化以及語言能力的課程
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So, your program is for English teaching graduate program and in that program it also has some culture learning courses. Is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少有三堂課關於文化與溝通的課。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'related to' in the translation, which changes the meaning and leaves out important details.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'related to' at the end of the sentence instead of before 'culture and communication', resulting in incorrect word order.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What the assignment in this culture communication courses?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing question mark

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這文化溝通課程可能因每位學生狀況不同而因人而異。以我做為例子:我在台灣試著找一個教英文的工作。為了正明我有這個能力擔任這個職務，我必須在中文上有一定的語言能力。因此很多給我的作業是有關中英的翻譯。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You said because you want to teach English in Taiwan, in the program, you need to prove that you have a certain Chinese competence. You need to finish some assignment in the program and the assignment is about translating Chinese. Is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the assignments given in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'finish' before the subject 'you' instead of the correct word order.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯阿，而且我還被要求要針對我的口說和寫作能力來磨練磨練。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok. Let’s come back the sentence before what I said. Is that your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿，我記得那句話。當我拿到一些中文句子的時候我不知道怎麼用英文表達。你知道的，有些中文字對外國人來說是很難辨認的，我需要一些幫助所以我請我的同事來幫我 我請她幫我翻譯那個句子並且寄簡訊來告訴我。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'sent a text message' instead of 'sent me the answer'
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	not mentioning a greeting or polite expression

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You meant you asked your colleague to translate the Chinese into English. So she delivered that message to you. Is that the situation happened? You meant this message is just the answer of the assignment.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那簡訊就真的只是我功課的答案而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
The message in our investigatory file between the pages number 14 to 16. Please check these messages. Are those messages delivered by your colleague because you ask for help to your assignment? Are they right?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，這些全部的簡訊都是為了完成我的作業這個目的所發送的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation about your wife accused you that you have an affair with Cai Yan Wang? What’s your plea?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事真的想太多了。我知道她對我顧這個家的能力沒有很滿足，我希望庭上瞭解我老婆從我讀這個學位的最開始就沒有支持我。她根本沒有意願來幫助我完成這個學位。如果她能有一點點幫助我的意願的話，我根本不用請我的同事幫我。我覺得她應該要為這些所有的誤解道歉，我希望她理解。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your sentences, you and your wife do not have a satisfied marriage.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們最一開始的婚姻時，我們確實有一段不錯的時光。但問題在於我的工作。 我嘗試在台灣教葡萄牙語維生但我沒辦法得到穩定的教學時數。所以我工作的問題變成我與我老婆之間的問題。我們時常針對這個問題吵架。她不信我已經盡了我的全力，我沒棒法讓她知道我所受的挫折以及我所處的困境
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok. Let’s talk about your graduate degree program. When do your program begin? Is that finish? Do you finish the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在民國99年的春天開始這個課程。這是一個兩年的計畫。我應該再民國101年12月完成這個計畫的。我沒有完成這個學位因為我需要做我的兼職工作所以我沒有時間完成一些作業。就像我所說的，我的老婆沒有很支持我在這個學位上。這讓我覺得追求那個學位完全都是靠我個人，我太累了也太受挫。
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'first' in 'I first started the program'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'Spring' in 'in Spring 2010'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'December' in 'in December 2012'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'my course' in 'do my course assignments'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'all' in 'all alone by myself'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'too' in 'too tired and too frustrated'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我在民國99年的春天開始這個課程'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我應該再民國101年12月完成這個計畫的'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我沒有完成這個學位因為我需要做我的兼職工作所以我沒有時間完成一些作業'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我的老婆沒有很支持我在這個學位上'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '這讓我覺得追求那個學位完全都是靠我個人'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You meant this program is for two-year long. Why you cannot get the degree? Why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我不能完成所有課程所要求的東西。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'the' before 'course requirement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '不能' (cannot) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When is your registration over?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊在學最後的期限是民國102年的秋天。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation uses the wrong calendar system, converting the year to the Republic of China calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, you finish your degree program on December 5th in 2012. After that day, you don’t need to finish your assignment. Is that right? But you have messages delivered by your colleague after the course ended for six months. What’s your reason?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我雖然沒有完成這個學位但並不代表我不想讓我的語言能力進步阿。就算我的計畫失敗了，我仍然想要增進我的中文能力所以我靠自學來達成這個目標。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of 'improve'
cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	not accurately conveying the emphasis on 'still'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You meant although you didn’t finish the program, you want to learn Chinese by yourself in order to improve your Chinese ability?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
沒錯，這就是為什麼我請我同事幫忙的原因。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague plays a role as your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'private tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她並不是我的家教而已，而且他是我真正的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不只是' before '家教而已'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我嘗試要付她錢但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我嘗試要付她錢' instead of '我嘗試要付她錢'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
You didn’t pay her salary, why she still delivers some messages to you in the midnight although you didn’t pay her. Isn’t that beyond the co-worker’s responsibility for helping others?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the person being referred to as 'she'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'although you didn't pay her' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '不辭辛勞' as 'delivering messages' instead of 'answering questions'.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我說他是一個很支持我的朋友了。她用她自己的時間來協助我學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order of the sentence.

Yes, I am still working there.
沒錯我仍然在那邊上班。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does Cia Yen Wang still work in the cram school, too?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the cram school in the translation.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她仍然在那邊上班，但我們不是搭擋了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們不再搭擋了' instead of '但我們不是搭擋了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you need to subpoena more witness or evidence?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' before the noun 'witness or evidence', which is incorrect in English.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena Cia Yen Wang in Bo Yuan cram school to the court. I want to ask her to explain the relationship between she and the defendant and ask her to explain the meaning of those messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical details of the purpose of subpoenaing Cia Yen Wang and the background of the text messages.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include the necessary punctuation marks to separate the different parts of the sentence.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, do you need any help from the court to investigate any further evidence?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has some actions according to the relationship between my husband and his colleague. One of the actions is to persuade Cia Yen Wang to quit the job. Can we ask the court to prove that action?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'court' instead of 'cram school'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of 'cram school'

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you need the court to investigate any evidence for you? The situation is your degree finished on the December 5th in 2012. You don’t have a reason to act with your colleague Cia Yen Wang in the reason of finishing your assignment. Especially, your message activity is starting after 9pm. Your behavior is suspected by people. Do you have any evidence to help your case?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master's degree being completed in 2012.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user incorrectly placed the name 'Cia Yen Wang' before the phrase 'your colleague'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user incorrectly placed the phrase 'in the reason of finishing your assignment' after the phrase 'with your colleague Cia Yen Wang'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user incorrectly placed the phrase 'is starting after 9pm' after the phrase 'your message activity'.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有想到有任何庭上可以採取的行動來針對我的行為。就像我所說的，我的同事和我的行為的目的是非常簡單的。我只是想要增進我的語言能力和學習中文。

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '來針對我的行為' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '庭上可以採取的行動'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'communication' as '行為' which means 'behavior' instead of '溝通' which means 'communication'.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
 Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery. The defendant , Yu-Hua Chen, file this case.

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Let me ask the defendant, how long did you married and di you have child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should be in the past tense to agree with the subject.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
My husband and I have married for four years. We don’t have child

omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a period at the end of the sentence.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or on abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you get married in Taiwan or abroad?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan. Four years ago he came to Taiwan and wanted to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker being the one who wanted to learn Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'came' before the subject 'he', resulting in incorrect word order.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Was his job is to teach Portuguese in Taiwan for several years ago?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
 In the beginning, he was the Portuguese teacher in Taiwan. After we get married, he continued to do that. But Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hour is not stable. Sometimes he did not any job for one month to two months. Because he tried to get stable job, he tried to teach English. But his mother tongue is not English, he decided to
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the husband is a Portuguese teacher in the original text.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the husband's teaching hour is unstable and sometimes he has no classes for one to two months.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user did not mention that the husband decided to go for further studies to teach English.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'did not any job' instead of 'did not have any job'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not use proper punctuation at the end of the sentence.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mention he want to get advanced degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about studying in Taiwan and obtaining a degree.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
 No, he hopes to teach English in Taiwan and he tried to get degree about English teaching. He found distance learning program in California. Therefore, he does not have to come to America and finish his degree from online learning. After he finish his degree, he can get the master degree. His plan is that he can get this degree and found English in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the distance learning program in California.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention that the distance learning program is related to English teaching.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'from online learning' which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase 'and found English in Taiwan' which is not present in the original text.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between the person he had affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleague in cram school. The cram school arranges foreigner teacher and Chinese teacher. Therefore, the Chinese teacher was the person she had affair with, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the relationship between the characters

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they have the affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word '外遇' (affair) in the translation.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
Initially, I found my husband stayed in cram school and worked for long time. I have asked him for long time that it was just English cram school and why did you work overtime. He told me that he had a partner of Chinese teacher and he had much communication with her. At first, I had no doubt on him. I found that he would pick up some phone after his works. When he picked up the phone, he would not tell in front of me and choose to talk in his study room. This action makes some doubts on him and I started to check on his phone.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the information that the husband stays in the cram school after work.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user does not mention the suspicion the narrator has towards her husband's behavior.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skips the sentence about the husband receiving phone calls after work.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user adds the information that the husband has a partner who is a Chinese teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not clear and lacks proper word order.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user does not use proper punctuation marks in the translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user uses the word 'cram school' instead of 'English cram school' in the translation.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user does not translate the term '中師' (Chinese teacher) in the translation.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you found something wrong in his cell phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'unusual' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I found that he usually made the same phone call to someone. I started get the curious in his phone book. After that, I found he had the message with woman every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'phone book' instead of 'text messages'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of '通簡訊'

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
 It was just message, is there something wrong in the message?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it was just normal message, that’s fine. He is the person who get married, how could he send some strange message? I have the content of their message to the court, it should be concluded in this file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '讓對方發一些很親密的字句' as 'send some strange message' instead of 'let the other party send some intimate words'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing the message content to the court

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see file one on the page thirteen. There are several content of message, please look at it. Does the message come from your cellphone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機上的內容簡訊
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the word '內容簡訊' (text message) which is not present in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I have several questions about this. Does the first message comes from the number 0958932 in the time of 2012, November 31th at 9:50p.m.? the content”我很想念你的愛” 這是怎麼一回事.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'I really miss you, my love' as '我很想念你的愛', which means 'I miss your love' instead of '我真的很想念你, 我的愛', which means 'I really miss you, my love'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the possessive pronoun '的' after the noun '你', which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我很想念你, 我的愛'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user translated the present tense 'miss' as the past tense 'missed'. The correct translation should be '我真的很想念你, 我的愛'.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是從我一個同事發過來的，我記得他因為我休假想念我所以才發過來的。她有點擔心我，這就是為什麼他發簡訊給我。我同事在美國接受，她覺得這樣是很正常的，這就是她這樣表達自己想法。而這封簡訊”我很想念你的愛，這只是我們表達關心的方式。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You just mention that she stayed in the States so her thought is more westernized, right? Her emotional expression is more deliberate, tight? So ,“My love” does not mean so much, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'My love' without considering its cultural and semantic implications.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user fails to understand the cultural significance of the phrase '我的愛' and its meaning in the context of the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
這樣的表達方式在親密朋友是很常見的。
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text, which is about a common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the meaning she just mentioned before?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical context of the previous sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我前面說的，她只是擔心我，而且我們只是工作上的同事。我這樣請假兩天，她擔然會擔心我啊。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that they are only work colleagues, while the original text implies a closer relationship as partners.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
 Do you mean that you just leave for two days and she send this message to you? Without your assistance in class, so she missed you very much? Just that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
內容就是這樣，沒什麼大不了的阿
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the message being discussed.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent from the same number in 2013, January 13th at 11:55 p.m. 簡訊內容”希望在身邊何時能達成” Can you tell me the mean and why she send this message to you
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這封簡訊是想問我說如何表達這樣情感在他的作業裡面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她寫這封簡訊是想告訴我如何在我的作業中表達一個中文句子。'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '問' (ask) in the translation should be replaced with '告訴' (tell) to accurately convey the meaning of 'to tell me' in the original text.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You just mentioned sthat she sent this message for you just to help you with your assignment and when did she send that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛所說的，我現在在遠距教學課程之中。在這個課程之中，我必須得修滿30學分才能拿到學位。那當然我得完成一些指定的作業
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of attending a Master's program and the requirement to complete assignments and exercises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order in the sentence 'In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree.'

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you just explain what did you study in your degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'just' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'just' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位主要是有關英語教學。在這學位的課程之中，有些是關於英語教學，也有一部分文化有關，但是有些和語言能力有相關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '學位' which is not the correct term in this context.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The term 'TESOL' is not translated in the user's translation.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
You mean that your degree is about TESOL but there are some courses about culture communication, is that correct?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
式的，我記得課程裡有三門課和文化溝通有關。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'at least' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'at least' at the end of the sentence instead of before the verb 'remember'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'related' instead of 'about' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
In this kind of course, what kind of assignment did the professor give to you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'professor' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'to' after the verb 'give' instead of before.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
在這門課程中，每個學生拿到的作業都因人而異，就以我來說，我是一個在台灣尋求英語教學的人，為了證明我有能力達成這樣的事情，我必須得證明我有很好的中文能力，所以在我的作業裡，有很多描述中英之間翻譯的不同
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that your plan is to teach English in Taiwan and you have to have good Chinese ability. You have to complete some assignment in this course. The content of assignments is to translate Chinese sentences
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the assignments given in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'is' before the subject 'you' in the sentence.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對，除了這樣之外，我必須得精進我的中文口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok, let’s come back to the sentence you just mentioned. Is those content about your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我還記得這個句子，當我拿這樣的中文句子，我不知道要怎樣翻成英文，你也知道，有些中文字對外國人來說很難辨認。我需要幫助，所以我找我的同事幫忙，所以我請她翻譯，把答案傳給我
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by the colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not in correct English word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'translate' instead of 'interpret' in the sentence.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean the situation is that you type Chinese to her and she sent English sentence to you, is that correct? In other words, the message is about the answer of your assignment.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就只不過是我作業上的答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Please look at file one from thirteen to sixteen. Please see all content. Are all message the answer of your assignment? which get help from your colleague

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，所有簡訊就只是為了完成我作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Please explain that your wife just mentioned you have very close relationship with your colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of an extramarital affair in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the mention of the wife's statement at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the phrase 'Please explain'.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太實在想太多了，我知道她對於我無法支撐家庭，養家活口很不滿意。我想讓法院知道，當我在修這門課的時候，她沒有給我太大的幫助。她並不想幫助我完成這個學位，如果她願意幫忙我，我就不要請教我的同事了，她才是為這些誤解負責
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using '修這門課' instead of '完成我的學位'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	translating 'supportive' as '幫助' instead of '支持'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating 'supportive' as '支持'

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your saying, there is some unsatisfactory between you and your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚的時候，我們過得很愉快，但問題在於我有沒有工作，我想在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是工作一直很不穩定，所以工作就成了我們兩個之間的問題，為了工作這件事，我們已經吵了很多次了，她不相信我已經盡力了，她都不了解我遇到的挫折和很大困境

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
OK, let’s come back to the degree we just mentioned. Can you tell me that when did you start and did you finish and get the degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of the master's degree program.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這課程在2010年春季開始的，他是一個兩年期的課程，我應該在2012年12月會完成這個學位。但我沒有完成是因為我中途有許多工作，所以沒有把時數補滿，就像我之前講的，我太太沒有支持我這樣做。所以覺得只有我一個人在為這個學位而奮鬥，所以我感到疲倦而且挫折

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that this degree is a two-year program and you did not finish it. Could you explain that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有完成所有必修課程
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'requirement' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
The last semester you register in this course, when did you end?

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後註冊的學期是2012秋季
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'fall' which is a critical detail in the original text.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If everything was going through like you said, the last semester would end in 2012, December 5th and you wouldn’t have any assignment after that. But you still have message for six months after the course ended.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
 雖然我沒有完成我的學位，但不代表我不能增進我的語言能力阿，雖然我沒辦法完成學位，但我還是想增進我的中文能力，所以決定自己研讀

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean even though you failed to finish this degree, you still want to learn Chinese and improve yourself.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
那也就是為什麼我持續問我同事問題
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, your colleague play role with tutor in your learning.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他扮演不僅是家教而且要是很要好的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her money?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you pay her money?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我想付錢但她不要了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想付錢但她不要了' instead of '沒有，我想付錢但她不要了'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you did pay her money, why did she answer you at midnight which she was supposed to? This relationship is not normal between colleagues.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
 就像之前說得，她是一個非常好的人。他願意花她的時間來幫我增進中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '她是一個非常好的朋友' instead of '她是一個非常好的人'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about the friend using her own time to help with learning Chinese.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach in the cram school?

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我仍在那邊
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'working' which is a critical detail in the original text.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Did your co-worker, Tsai-Yen Wang work in this cram school?

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她仍在那邊工作，但我們沒有再一起教書了

Prosecutor, is there more evidence you want the court to investigate or subpoena?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of witnesses or evidence that the prosecutor may want to further investigate or subpoena.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena his colleague , Tsai-Yen Wang, in Po-Yuan cram school which was the witness in this case. Please ask her why did she send those message and the content of messages.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'Plaintiff' and 'do you have any evidence' in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had taken some actions to their relationship. I heard that the cram school had persuaded his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang, to leave the job. Is it possible that I want the cram school to confirm this.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you want ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you? The situation is that your case had finished in 2012. There is no reason that you can explain message for your assignment. Especially, your message comes from after 9 p.m. and those casue some doubts for people.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我覺得庭上好像沒辦法查到任何幫助我案情的證據。就像我剛才說的，我們之間傳簡訊的目的是非常單純的。這樣做只是為了完成語言能力和完成我的作業。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
 Today is the preparation procedure for adultery case. The plaintiff, Chen Yu Hua, filed this case. The main reason the plaintiff file this case is that her husband has intimate relationships with his colleagues. The plaintiff found out some intimate message in her husband’s cellphone. In addition, her husband would find some reasons for working late and he would tele-conference with his colleague, Wang Chai Yu. The contents between her husband and his colleague collected by the plaintiff was too intimate, and it’s beyond the normal colleague relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. Defendant, your wife doubt you that you have adultery with other women. What’s your plea?

Not guilty, of course.
當然無罪。

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
 Today is the preparation procedure. And the main goal is to clarify the contents between the defendant and his colleague. We would like to know this case in detail and to know if it constitutes adultery. Do both of the parties understand the procedure?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the communication between the defendant and his colleague.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the critical context of why the communication details are important in determining if it constitutes adultery.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'Do both parties understand the procedure?' instead of 'Do both of the parties understand the procedure?'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'contents' instead of 'communication details', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

我明白

我了解。

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you two been married and do you have any children?

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve been married for four years and we don’t have any kids.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Do you two get married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you two get married in Taiwan or abroad?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan. He came to Taiwan four years ago. And at that time, he came to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is the one who wants to learn Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Has he taught Portuguese in the last (few) years?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not really popular in Taiwan, so my husband’s working situation is not really stable. Further, sometimes he would have a period between jobs (which) lasts for month. Then, he wants to have a stable income. He started to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he wants to pursue advanced study

grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing comma
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	redundant phrase

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just said that that he wants to pursue advanced study, so does he want to get another degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in their translation.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he needs to get a degree for English teaching. He found a distance program online from California. Consequently he doesn’t have to go to the United States. He can complete the program at home. After he finish(es) all the courses, he can get the degree. If he receives the degree from California, the US, then he would find a job of English teaching in Taiwan

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s his relationship with his colleague
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the affair in their translation.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in the cram school. At that cram school, they assign a foreign teacher to match with another local teacher and that person is his partner.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they two have intimate relationship?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'intimate' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'two' after the verb 'have' instead of before.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Do you see any abnormal message in his cellphone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'abnormal' after 'message' instead of before.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I saw the same number calls him or he calls that number in his cellphone. So I checked his text messages. After that, I found out that, he sent messages with a woman almost every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of '通簡訊'

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
I think frequently texting with another person is quite normal. Is the message content abnormal ?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
 If the content is normal, I would not doubt him. However, he’s already married, how could he make others send him some intimate messages? I provided the contents of the text messages. I think all of them is (are) in the documents.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '在卷夾裡面了' as 'in the documents' instead of 'in the file folder'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'think' in the phrase 'I think all of them is (are) in the documents'.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see the Document One, page13. Defendant, here are some pieces of your text massages. Please check it. Are they the same (as) the ones in your cellphone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，它們和我手機裡的一樣。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '它們' (they) before '和我手機裡的一樣' (same as my cell phone), resulting in incorrect word order.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then I would like to ask you some questions according to these messages. The first one is sent from the number 0958932*** at nine fifty p.m. on November 31st 2012. The content is I really miss you…(what do you mean by this sentence?)

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
我記得我那時候休假了兩天。她有點擔心我。所以她才會發這則簡訊。我的同事是在美國受教育的所以她待人比較隨和， 所以她講話比較直接就像簡訊上那樣。「親愛的」只是我們稱呼自己在乎的人的方法。
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of being concerned or worried

omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of being open-minded
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of calling people we care about as 'my love'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that the person who sent you this message was educated in America, so she’s quite open-minded and westernized? Then she’s quite open to express her emotions and affections. Therefore, “my love” means nothing. Do you mean that?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿，這就只是認識很久朋友互相的稱呼或是互相關心的人會這樣稱呼。
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural context and significance of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
How about another sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我說過了，她很擔心我。但我們就只是同事的關係。當我有兩天沒去上班的時候，她當然會想到我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們只是同事的關係' instead of '就只是同事的關係我們'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'partners at work' as '同事的關係' is incorrect. It should be translated as '工作夥伴' or '工作上的合作夥伴'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Did you mean that she sent you this message just because you were two day off from work? Without your assistance and cooperation, so she missed you? Is that this simple?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對阿就只是這樣而已，並沒有甚麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'The message' which is a critical detail in the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Then, please check the second message. It’s from the same number at 11:55 p.m. on January 13th 2013. The content is something intimate, what does that mean? What does that mean by these lines?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the intimate meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這樣的訊息給我只是想要教我中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you this kind of messages to help you with your Chinese assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太先前說的，我正在唸一個學位。要完成學位我要在畢業前修完30個學分，那當然我需要做一些作業來拿到學分阿。

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain further for your master degree? What do you study for?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the master's degree.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位是有關英語教學的。要完成這個學位，裡面有些關於教學的課程也有些關於中英語文能力的訓練。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you pursue for the English teaching mater degree; however there are still some further culture courses in that degree?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，至少有三門課是跟文化和溝通相關的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of courses.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是的' (yes) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
You used the tem culture, so what would the teacher give you as assignments in the course?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'give' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'tem' before 'culture' instead of after.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這門課的功課可能會因學生而異。像我自己的話，我來台灣然後想要找一個英語教學的教師職位，為了要達成這個目標然後顯現這個能力，所以我必須要有足夠的中文能力。因此我很多作業都是關於中英句子的翻譯。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '然後顯現這個能力' which is not present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '像我自己的話' at the beginning of the sentence, which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我自己的話像'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '因此我很多作業都是' at the beginning of the sentence, which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我很多作業都是因此'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '這門課的功課可能會因學生而異' at the beginning of the sentence, which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '功課可能會因學生而異這門課的'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '為了要達成這個目標' at the beginning of the sentence, which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '要達成這個目標為了'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '然後想要找一個英語教學的教師職位' at the beginning of the sentence, which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '找一個英語教學的教師職位然後想要'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我來台灣' at the beginning of the sentence, which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '來台灣我'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '這門課的功課可能會因學生而異' at the beginning of the sentence, which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '功課可能會因學生而異這門課的'.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that your goal is to teach English in Taiwan, so the course would ask you to proof your Chinese competence? Therefore, you had to complete some assignments and these assignments are about English and Chinese translation?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
當然阿，而且我還需要磨練我的口說和寫作技巧
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, so you said that this message content was your assignment right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿，我還記得那個句子是甚麼。當我看到一個中文句子的時候我可能會不知道如何用英文來表達。你也知道吧，中文字有些時候對於外國人來說很難辨認阿，所以我需要別人的幫助，所以我就問我同事，我請她幫我翻譯然後請她把答案以簡訊寫給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that you ask your colleague this sentence in Chinese and she sent it back in English? Is this the situation? You mean that this message was just all about assignment?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'just as a solution to the assignment' in the translation.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那則簡訊真的就只是作業答案而已啦。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the homework assignment.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then, how about the contents in Document One from page 14 to 16? Please check these messages. Are they all for your assignments? Just because you want your colleague to answer you in English?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'text messages' in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of 'text messages' being sent by the other person.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'help' being sought from the other person.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of 'help' being sought for the user's assignments.

omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of the other person sending the messages in response to the user's request for help with assignments.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，它們的目的都相同，就只是要幫我完成作業而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the messages being referred to.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then how about the adultery between you and 王彩燕 from you wife?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's accusation and focused only on the adultery between the person and 王彩燕.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
對於這件事我太太真的是想太多了。我知道她對於我可以照顧家庭的能力不滿意。我想讓您知道的是，從我開始念學位開始，她都很不支持，她甚至一點都不想要幫助我完成學位。如果她多幫我一點忙的話，我也不用問我同事啦，我想她應該要為這樣的誤解負責。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, you two don’t get along quite well?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在婚姻初期我們是相處得滿愉快的。但她一直對我的工作有微詞。我也嘗試要教葡萄牙語來維生，但工作不穩定。所以我們有時候會為了這件事有口角，我們常為了這件事情不合，她都不相信我有努力找工作，我也很難讓她理解我有多沮喪和挫折。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s go back to the mater degree you mentioned. When did you start your master degree? When did you end it? Did you receive the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2010的春季開始上課。它是一個兩年的課程，我應該要在2012的12月完成這個學業，但是我並沒如期完成，因為我有一些兼職，還要寫作業，這樣有點困難。就想我先前說的，我太太不太支持我，所以我會覺得我自己在念書的時候好像只有一個人在奮鬥，所以我相當疲憊跟挫折。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that it’s two-year-long program and you didn’t finish it, why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我無法達成每堂課的要求。

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When was(did) the last semester you registered end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋季班。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '的秋季班' which is not present in the original text.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If what you said I is true, and the last semester of your registration ended on December 5th 2012; then after that you would not have to contact your colleague for the assignment right? However, you two, you and your colleague, had been contacting with each other for over six months after that.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我可能真的無法完成學業，但並不代表我不想學習阿。雖然我無法完成學業，但我想持續精進中文，所以才會繼續和她聯絡。

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even that you didn’t complete your degree, you still want to sharpen your Chinese by your own?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the meaning of the original text

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
是的，這就是我繼續和我同事尋求協助的原因。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'continue' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
Your colleague is just like your tutor right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是家教的角色她還是我真心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經有提過，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經有提過，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why would she like to teach you Chinese so late at night, even it’s time for bed? Is it beyond the normal relationships between colleagues?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	changed the meaning of the original text

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
我說過啦，她是一個很好的朋友，很支持我。她用她自己私人的時間來教我中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我說過啦，她是一個很好的朋友，很支持我。'
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of learning Chinese in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of the friend using her own time to help with learning Chinese.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach at that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific subject of the sentence, 'you'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'still' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'teach'.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那裏工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does 王彩燕 also work there till now?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那裏工作，但我們沒有再搭檔合作了。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'team up' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Is there any person you want to subpoena or is there any evidence you want to investigate more?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena 王彩燕 as a witness from 伯元cram school. I want her to describe their relationships and why she wrote that kind of messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical context of the messages and their purpose.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that cram school has taken some actions for their relationships. Further, the cram school had tried to make 王彩燕 off. I don’t know if there is any possibility to proof this.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'queen' before '王彩燕', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'off' after 'make' instead of using the correct phrase 'make someone leave'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'proof' instead of 'confirm', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? Now the situation is that your program should end on December 5th 2012, and you should not use completing assignments as an excuse to contact 王彩燕. The text messages between you two almost happened after 9 p.m. It’s really easily to rouse people’s curiosity. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master's degree program ending on December 5th, 2012.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the critical context of the defendant using completing assignments as an excuse to contact 王彩燕.

omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the critical context of the text messages between the defendant and 王彩燕 raising suspicions.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant needing evidence to help his case.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我實在想不到有甚麼其他的證據了，誠如我之前所說的，我和我同事之間的簡訊互動真的很普通，我真的只是想要增進中文能力然後繼續學中文。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
we have been married for four years. We don’t have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you two marry in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan and he wanted to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is the one who wants to learn Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
in the past few years, he worked at Taiwan as a Portuguese teacher?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'he worked as a Portuguese teacher in Taiwan in the past few years.'

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language to learn, his teaching hours was unstable.sometimes he did not have to work for a month.Later he wanted to teach English, in order to have stable teaching hours.But his mother tongue is not English, so he decides to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he seek an advanced degree, you mean he want to get a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of studying in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get the degree of English- teaching.He found a online learning program from California in the USA on the internet.He can learn English on the internet without going to the USA.After he finishes the program, he can get a master degree.His original plan is that after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan as a professor.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
First, I noticed that my husband always stayed late at the cram school and worked.I asked him several times, it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so many extra work?He told me that because he has to discuss many details with his partner.At first, I did not suspect him.But later I found that he always gets some calls after he came back.And, when he gets the calls, he talks in the study room. He never talks on the phone in front of me.So I checked his phone and I started to suspect him.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the specific reason why the husband needs to communicate with his partner at the cram school.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user does not provide the context of why the wife starts to suspect her husband.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skips the sentence about the wife checking her husband's phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is always the same number.I was very curious and I checked his text message.After I checked, I found that she text the message with the woman every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is texting with a woman.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'she texts messages with the woman' instead of 'she text the message with the woman'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
It’s just text messages, I think it’s okay, is there any weird content inside?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If these are just usual messages, that’s okay. But he’s a married man, how can he let the other people to send him those intimate messages? I’ve already provided some messages to the court, they should be on the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '已婚的人' as 'married man' instead of 'married person'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court in the translation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Document number 1 page number 13. Defendant, please check the content of the text messages.Are these from your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對 這些都是我手機裡的簡訊
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'message' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'cell phone'.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I would like to ask you some questions about these messages.The first message is sent at 9:50 pm. November, thirty-one, 2012.from the number 0958932.The content is: I really miss you, my love, what’s the meaning of this?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事傳的，我記得那時我請了兩天假，她有點擔心,所以她寄了那封簡訊給我她是在美國讀書的，所以思想很開放那就是她表答自己的方法，她平常都這樣講話，至於my love那個地方只是要表答我們在乎的人

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean the sender was educated in the USA, so she’s more opened?She’s more open-minded about expressing herself, so there’s nothing with the two words, my love?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the sender was educated in the USA.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation incorrectly suggests that the sender is more open-minded about expressing herself due to being educated in the USA.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
那就是只是彼此是好朋友會這樣說而已，沒什麼啊
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '那就是只是彼此是好朋友會這樣說而已，沒什麼啊' does not capture the idea that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.

那她前面那句呢？
What about the last sentence she mentioned?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛說的，因為我請假所以她有點擔心，畢竟我們是搭檔, 她當然會擔心
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that she sent those two messages because you took two days off?Because without your assistance, she missed you, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對呀 就是這樣，沒什麼大不了
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'The message' which is a critical detail in the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, then the second message which is sent at 11:55 at night, January thirteenth 2013, sent by the same person.The content is, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” Can you tell me what does it mean? Why she sends such a message?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這句話來告訴我要怎麼寫我一個中文的作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她寫這句話來告訴我怎麼寫我的中文作業'.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you such a message is to help you with your homework? IWhat does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛告訴法官的，我之前想修碩士學位在課程中，我需要得到30個學分才能得到那個學位，當然我就會有一些作業
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about completing exercises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '當然我就會有一些作業' (of course I will have some assignments) at the end of the sentence instead of after '需要得到30個學分才能得到那個學位' (I need to obtain 30 credits to obtain that degree).

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain the details about your master degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about the master's degree.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我是在修英語課，在那些課程中有些是關於英語教學，有些則是關於文化與語言能力方面的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you want to get the TESOL and there’s some cultural related program, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

我記得至少有三門課都跟語言文化有關係
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What’s the assignment in the program?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing question mark

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
語言文化的作業每個人不同我的話，因為我在台灣想要學習英文來當英文老師為了要達到這個目的，我必須要證明我對英文中文有足夠的了解所以很多的作業都是中英的翻譯句子
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to understand Chinese as to be the teacher in Taiwan?As a result, you have to finish your assignment including the translation of some Chinese and English?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the assignment, specifically that it involves translating sentences.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect, resulting in a confusing and unclear statement.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的就是這樣, 而且我還需要增強我的寫作技巧以及口說
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay let’s go back to the sentence we just mentioned, is that your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
有 我還記得這個句子，當我拿到這個句子並不知道它的英文要怎麼講 你也知道有時候中文字對外國人來說真的很難，我需要別人幫忙所以我就請我的同事幫我我請她幫我翻譯那個句子然後再寄簡訊給我
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that you asked your colleague to send you the answer with the text messages?Is that right?The content of the text message is just the answer of your assignment?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text by not including the specific question asked to the colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'Is that right?' instead of 'That right?'

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那些內容就只是我作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then let’s check the page number 14 to 16, the text messages content in the document, please check the content, are these text messages sent from the other party was because you have to deal with your homework?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation of your wife accused you of having adultery with you colleague?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事真的是想太多了，我知道她不滿意我在經濟能力可能無法養這個家我希望法官知道的是，在我剛開始要求學位的時候，她都沒有給我任何一點支持她根本不願意幫忙我完成我的學業, 如果她能稍微給我點支持，那我也不用找我的同事幫忙啊，我覺得會有這些誤會,都是因為他一開始不支持

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your explanation, it seems that there’s some trouble between you and your wife

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
結婚剛開始我們的確很開心，不過問題在我的工作，我想臺灣教葡萄牙語, 可是沒有辦法得到穩定的授課時數結果工作變成我們兩個吵架的原因，我們總是因為這件事情吵架，她不相信我已經在這方面盡力了，沒有辦法讓她了解我其實真的非常挫敗

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s get back to the master degree you just mentioned. When did you master degree begin, does it end? Did you get your degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的, 這是一個兩年的課程, 我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的但因為我兼職的關係所以我沒有辦法在時間內修完學分像我剛剛說的，我的老婆並沒有很支持我，我覺得好像只有我自己一個人努力在追求那個學位, 我覺得很累而且很受挫
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'Spring' before '2010'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'December' before '2012'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'course' before 'assignments'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'all' before 'alone'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'and' before 'too frustrated'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that the program is for 2 years and you didn’t finish at the end, what’s the reason?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the reason for not completing the program.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒修完全部的必修
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
Then when did your last semester you’ve registered end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是在2010的秋天
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user incorrectly translated 'fall 2012' as '2010的秋天', which means 'fall 2010' instead of 'fall 2012'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If that’s true, just as you’ve mentioned, then your last semester should be ended on fifth December in 2012There should be no more assignment, right? But the messages you text with your colleague last for 6 months after your program has ended, what’s the reason?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect verb tense
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	adding unnecessary information

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成我的學業但不代表我不想要增進我的語言能力啊！即使我沒有成功地拿到那個學位，但我還是想要增進我的中文能力所以我還是繼續努力
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the master's degree program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'even' in the wrong position.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對, 這就是我還找我同事幫忙的原因
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the details of asking the colleague for help.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, your colleague served as your tutor?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague's role as a tutor.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的中文家教, 她也是一個真心好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她不收
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她不收'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she still send you the text messages on midnight, when she has to go to sleep? Is this beyond one’s colleague should do?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of not paying the person in question.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'on midnight' instead of 'at midnight'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'she has' instead of 'she had'.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個非常支持朋友的人，她用了自己的時間來幫助我學習中文

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific subject of teaching, which is English.

Yes, I am still working there.
對 我還有在那邊工作
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is your colleague, zhia-yen, Wang, still works there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那邊工作, 但我們已經不是搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經不是搭檔了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any detail or any other information or people you want to subpoena?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena Ms.Wang who worked in the cram school. I would like her to explain her relation with the defendant and explain the content and the reason that she texted those messages.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific name of the cram school, which is important for understanding the context.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide any information about the nature of the relationship between the witness and the defendant, which is crucial for understanding their connection.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had do something to deal with their relationships. They asked Ms. Wang to leave that cram school, I would like to know if it’s possible to clarify this fact?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'do' instead of 'take'
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating 'cram school'

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?The situation is that your master degree, the program has ended on fifth December, 2012. There’s no excuse to say that you and Ms. Wang text message to deal with your assignment.Especially, you always send messages to each other after 9 o’clock at night, and that is very suspicious. Is there evidence can help you with your case？
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master degree program ending in December 2012.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the critical context of the defendant and Ms. Wang's text messages being suspicious.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence mentioning the defendant and Ms. Wang's text messages being suspicious.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase 'and that is very suspicious' which is not present in the original text.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有辦法想到任何其他的證據法院可以幫我調查就像我剛才說的，我們兩個通簡訊的原因就是這麼簡單而已，我只是想要進步我的語言能力然後繼續學中文而已

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re going to proceed the preparatory procedure of adultery case. The plaintiff, yu-hua, Chen, sued the case. The main reason is that… his…her husband is so intimate with his colleague at the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages from his colleague.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？

我也明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you married with your husband? Do you have any child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after 'Plaintiff' to separate it from the rest of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'have you married'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The question does not include the information about having children, which is present in the original text.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for 4 years and we don’t have a child.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'husband' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the plural form 'we have married' instead of the correct singular form 'we have been married'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
And did you two marry in Taiwan or abroad?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the speaker's husband.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan, and he wanted to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the speaker being married to the person they met in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverbial phrase 'each other' after the subject 'We' instead of after the verb 'met'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '認識' as 'met' instead of 'know' or 'got to know'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '先生' which means 'husband' in English.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '葡萄牙文' which means 'Portuguese' in English.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
During the past years, was his job teaching Portuguese…in Taiwan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he’s a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still teach Portuguese. However, since there were no many people … not many people want to learn Portuguese, his teaching hours was unstable. Even for one or two months, there’s a period between jobs. After……. After that, he changed to teach English, in order to have a better job. But his mother tongue is not English, so he decides to seek an advanced degree.

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he seek an advanced degree, did he want to get a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of Taiwan in the translation.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get the degree of English- teaching. He found a distance learning program from California in the USA on the internet. He can have the online learning without going to the USA … and learn English. After he gets all the credits, he can get a master degree. His original plan is that after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan as a professor.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between he and the person he has affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'What's the relationship between him and the person he has an affair with?'
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues at the cram school. The cram school has arranged.. arranged a foreigner and a Chinese teacher together, and she’s the one who he partnered with.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How come do you think they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'know' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'come' before 'how' instead of after.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is always a… the same number, I’m very curious and then I checked his text message. After I checked, I found that she text the message with the woman every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the phone number and the frequency of the text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect, resulting in a confusing and unclear translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'text the message' instead of 'exchange text messages', which changes the meaning of the original text.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
It’s just text messages, I think it’s okay, is there any unproper content inside?
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	misinterpretation of cultural norms

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If these are just usual messages, that’s okay. But he has… he’s a married man, how can he let the other party to text him with so many… text messages. I’ve already presented some text messages to the court, I think it is in the file… it should be on the file.
semantic conversion	omission of details	leaving out critical context

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Document number… page number 13. Defendant, please check the content of the text messages. Are these from your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是 這些都是我手機裡的簡訊
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the subject '這些' (these), which is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
So I will ask you some questions about these messages. The first message is … was sent from…at 9:50 pm. November, 31th, 2012, from phone number 0958932…. The content is, I really miss you, my love, what’s the meaning of this?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事傳的, 我記得那天我請了兩天假, 她有點擔心, 所以她才寄了那封簡訊給我, 我同事是在美國讀書的, 所以她的思想很開放, 那就是她表答自己的方法, 她都是這樣說話, 至於my love那個地方只是要表答我們在乎的人

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean by … do you mean that…the sender was educated in the USA, so she’s more westernized? And she’s more open-minded about her feeling? So there’s nothing, or any meaningful/ meaning of the two words, my love?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'my love' without considering its actual meaning.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
那就是只是彼此是好朋友會這樣說而已, 並沒有什麼
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation simply states that it is just something friends say without any significance.

那她前面那句呢？
What about… how about the last sentence she mentioned?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of the last sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛說的, 因為我請假, 她有點擔心, 我們就只是同事啊, 畢竟我們是搭檔, 她當然會擔心
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that she sent those two messages because you took 2 days-off? Because there’s no your assistance, she missed you, is that so?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對呀 就只是這樣的內容, 就沒有什麼大不了的
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, then the second message which is sent at 11:55 at night, January 13th, 2013, and was sent from the same person. The content is, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” Can you tell me what does it mean? Why she sends such a message?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這句話來告訴我要怎麼寫我一個中文的專案
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you such a message, is that she wants to help you with your homework? Is that right? What does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting the meaning of the original text

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛告訴法官的, 我之前在…想得到碩士學位, 在那個課程中, 我需要得到30個學分才能得到那個學位, 當然我就會有一些作業要寫
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain… the details…about your master degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我是在修英語教學, 在那些課程中有些是關於英語教學, 有些則是關於文化與語言能力方面的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '修' is translated as '修' instead of 'study' or 'take' which is more appropriate in this context.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you want to get the TESOL … you study for the TESOL program, and there’s some cultural related program, is that so?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
我記得至少有三門課都跟語言文化有關係
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
Then what’s the assignment/ what are the assignments provided from these program?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
語言文化的作業… 因人而異, 像我的呢, 就是, 我在台灣想要學習英文並且當英文老師, 為了要達到這個目的, 我必須要證明我對英文中文有很大…足夠的了解. 所以我很多的作業都是中英的翻譯句子

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	not translating important terms

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to understand Chinese as to be the teacher in Taiwan? As a result, you have to finish your assignment and the homework includes the translation of  some Chinese and English?

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的就是這樣, 而且我還需要增強我的寫作技巧以及口說技巧
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s… go back to the sentence we just mentioned, is that your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	reversed word order in the question

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對啊 我還記得這個句子, 當我拿到這個句子並不知道它的英文要怎麼講, 你也知道有時候中文字對外國人來說真的很難, 我需要別人幫忙, 所以我就請我的同事幫我, 我請她幫我翻譯那個句子然後再寄簡訊給我
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by their colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverbial phrase '當我拿到這個句子' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '講' at the end of the sentence instead of after the object.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '簡訊' which means 'text message' instead of 'answer' to refer to the translation provided by their colleague.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that you asked your colleague to send you the answer with the text messages? Is that the case? The content of the text message is just the answer of your assignment
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那些內容就只是我作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the critical detail that the message was a response to their homework.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then let’s check the page number 14 to 16, the text messages content in the document, please check the content, are these text messages sent from the other party was because you have to deal with your homework?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對, 所有的這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation of your wife accused you of having adultery with you colleague?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事真的是想太多了, 我知道她不滿意我在經濟方面支持這個家庭的情況, 我希望法官知道的是, 在我剛開始要求學位的時候, 她都沒有給我任何一點支持, 她根本不願意幫忙我完成我的學業, 如果她能稍稍支持我一點, 那我也不用找我的同事幫忙啊, 我覺得會有這些誤會, 她才應該是要被責貴的人吧!

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your explanation, it seems that there’s some trouble between you and your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在一開始, 結婚前我們的確有一段很美好的時光, 但…問題在我的工作, 我想臺灣教葡萄牙語, 卻沒有辦法得到比較多的授課時數, 結果工作變成我們兩個吵架的原因, 我們總是因為這件事情吵架, 她不相信我已經在這方面盡力了, 我沒有辦法讓她了解我其實真的非常沮喪, 而且遇到很多困難

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s get back to the master degree you’ve just mentioned. When did you master degree begin, does it end? Did you get your degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的, 這是一個兩年的課程, 我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的, 但因為我兼職的關係, 所以我沒有辦法在時間內修習所有我要的學分, 像我剛剛說的, 我的老婆並沒有很支持我, 我覺得好像只有我自己一個人孤獨的在追求那個學位, 我覺得很累而且很受挫
omission or addition	omission of details	missing the mention of Spring 2010

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我覺得好像只有我自己一個人孤獨的在追求那個學位'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that the program is for 2 years and you didn’t finish at the end, what’s the reason?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the reason for not completing the program.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法修完全部的必修
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'course requirement' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
Then when did your last semester you’ve registered end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是在2010的秋天
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user incorrectly translated 'fall 2012' as '2010的秋天', which means 'fall 2010' instead of 'fall 2012'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If that’s the case, just as you’ve mentioned, then your last… the last semester should be ended on 5th December in 2012, there should be no more assignment, right? But the messages you text with your colleague last for 6 months after your program has ended, what’s the reason?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	incorrect translation

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我的確沒有完成我的學業, 但這也不代表我不想要增進我的語言能力啊! 即使我沒有成功地拿到那個學位, 但我還是想要增進我的中文能力, 所以我還是繼續研讀
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability and be fluently speaking Chinese, is that so?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對, 這就是我還找我同事幫忙的原因
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the details of asking the colleague for help.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, your colleague can be said as… served as your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的中文家教, 她也是一個真的好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有, 我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她拒絕了'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she still send you the text messages on midnight, when she has to go to sleep? Is this beyond one’s colleague should do?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個非常支持朋友的人, 她用了自己的時間來幫助我學習中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我才說她是一個非常支持我的朋友'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'teach' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
對, 我還有在那邊工作
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is your colleague, zhia-yen, Wang, still works there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那邊工作, 但我們已經不是搭檔了!
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經不是搭檔了!'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any detail or any other information or people you want to subpoena?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena the…to subpoena zhia-yen, Wang who worked in po-yun cram school… as a witness. I would like her to explain her relation with the defendant and explain the content and the reason that she texted those messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had do something to deal with … their relationships. One of that thing is that they … asked zhia-yen, Wang to leave that cram school, I would like to know if it’s possible to clarify this fact?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the cram school to deal with their relationships.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'asked' before the subject 'zhia-yen, Wang', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'deal with' instead of 'take action to deal with', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you? The situation is that your master degree, the program has ended on 5th December, 2012. There’s no excuse to say that you and zhia-yen, Wang text message to deal with your assignment. Especially, you always, you texted messages to each other after 9 o’clock at night, and that is very suspicious. Is there evidence can help you with your case？
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Especially, you always, you texted messages to each other after 9 o’clock at night, and that is very suspicious.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'There’s no excuse to say that you and zhia-yen, Wang text message to deal with your assignment.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence: 'There’s no excuse to say that you and zhia-yen, Wang text message to deal with your assignment.'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有辦法想到任何其他的證據法院可以幫我調查的, 就像是我說的, 我們兩個通簡訊的原因就是這麼簡單而已.我只是想要進步我的語言能力然後繼續學中文而已

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case.The plaintiff, Yu Hua Chen filed this case.The reason why she filed the case is because her husband … had too imitate relationship with his colleague.The plaintiff found some very intimate massage in her husband’s cell phone.Plaintiff husband usually make up reasons for going home late … and have teleconference with his colleague彩燕王The … information that plaintiff had collected proved that her husband and his colleague has beyond co-workers’ relationship.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long…have you married your husband? And do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Plaintiff, how long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'have you married'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a comma after 'Plaintiff' to separate the introductory phrase.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years. And we don’t have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or in the foreign country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker is also from Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. It should be 'My husband and I met each other in Taiwan.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation incorrectly uses 'teach' instead of 'learn'. It should be 'my husband came to Taiwan to learn Portuguese.'

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past years, his job is teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense to match the context of the sentence.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
At first we met, he worked as a teacher who was teaching Portuguese.After he got married, he is still teaching PortugueseHowever, the Portuguese is … always not a popular language in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hours are always not very long.Sometimes … the period between jobs might be one month or two months.Later on, he hopes to have stable income. Therefore, he started to want to teach English.But English is not his mother tongue; he decided to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Did you mean that he wanted to study a diploma in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '進修' as 'diploma' instead of 'advanced degree'

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
NoBecause he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he needed to have a degree relating to English teaching.He found a program provided from the California online.  He didn’t have to go to America to learn the course. Instead, he can learn the course through on-line learning.If he finished all the courses required, he can have the degree.His plan is once he has the degree, he can apply for the jobs to teach English through this degree.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is the relationship between him and his colleague?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school.The cram school will have a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher in the same class. And the woman is the Chinese teacher in his class.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know he had an affair with her?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific people involved in the affair.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'he' before the verb 'had', resulting in incorrect word order.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I’m only aware of that he often stayed late in the cram school.I have asked him for many times that why you have to stay late in the cram school.He told me that because he has to work with the Chinese teacher, they have many things to discuss.At first, I didn’t doubt him.However, I found that he would receive some phone calls after he came home.And when he got the phone call, he will talk to the phone in his study instead of in front of me.This behavior made me doubt him. That is the reason why I started to check his cell phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
In the cell phone, did you find anything special?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'unusual' from the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is a phone number called him often.I became curious so I checked his texts.After I checked, I found that he almost texted with another woman every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the frequency of the phone calls.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the context of the person being referred to as 'him'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'called' before the subject 'him' instead of using the correct word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'called' instead of 'texted', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Texting messages is fine, right? Is the content inappropriate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is the content inappropriate?' instead of 'Is the content inappropriate?'

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If that is a normal text, that is OK.However, he is married, how could he text with another woman in such an intimate tone?I have provided some messages to the court. I believe you can see them in the file.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see the page 13 of investigatory file.Here are some messages. Defendant, please take a look.Are they the messages on your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是，這些是我手機上的簡訊
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the word '這些' (these) which is not present in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
According these messages, I want to ask you some questions.The first message was texted at nine fifty pm on thirty first, November, 2012 from 0958-932*** The content is 我真的很想你，我的愛 What does it mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I really miss you, my love' as '我真的很想你，我的愛' is accurate and conveys the same meaning.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我一個同事發的我記得那時候我休了兩天的假 她有點擔心我這也就是為什麼他會傳這封簡訊給我我的同事是在美國受教育，所以她的思想比較開放這是她說話的方式至於她稱呼我為我的愛，那只是一種我們之間的稱呼而已
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted the mention of the colleague's concern or worry
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	used incorrect word choices in translation
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	did not accurately translate the cultural meaning of 'my love'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that because the person who text you is educated in the United States, she is westernized.And the way she expressed herself is more openSo “my love” doesn’t mean anything special, right?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然，這只是一種表達關心的方式而已，只代表我們很關心彼此
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural meaning of the original text, which is about a common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous statement?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就如同我之前說的，她非常擔心我，我們是工作上的同事 當我不在工作崗位上兩天，她當然會想我啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就如同我之前說的，她非常擔心我'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'partners' in the original text is translated as '同事' which means 'colleagues' instead of 'partners'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the information that they are partners 'at work'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the information that the speaker was 'away for two days'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the information that the woman 'naturally missed' the speaker.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean the person texts you because you have two days off.Because she didn’t have your help in the class, she missed you?That’s all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對，當時的背景就是這樣，這封簡訊沒什麼
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message sent at eleven fifty fife p.m. on thirteenth, January, 2013 from the same phone number mentioned above.The content of the message is 我希望你可以在我身邊，什麼時候我們才可以在一起呢?What does this message mean? What did she send you this kind if message?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I want you by my side' as '我希望你可以在我身邊' is not accurate. The original text implies a stronger desire or longing, which is not conveyed in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '什麼時候我們才可以在一起呢?'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
 她寫給我這封簡訊的原因是教我在作業裡怎麼用中文講這句話
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she texted you this message to help you with your assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我之前講的，我正在進修碩士學程在這個學程，我被要求要修滿三十學分，才可以取得這個學位很自然地，我就有一些作業和練習要做啊
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what exactly you studied for your Master degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the assistant's Master degree.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位名稱是英語教學在這個學程裡面，主要的課程有關於英語教學，其他則關於文化還有語言能力方面的課程
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you are seeking a degree about English teaching, but there are some courses about culture and language competence.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about the specific courses related to culture and language competence.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是，我記得至少有三個課程和文化與溝通有關
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of courses in their translation.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
In this kind of courses, what kind of assignments would you have?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'have' in the question.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'have' before the subject 'you' instead of after.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
語言與文化課程的作業可能會因同學而異就舉我為例子我是一個希望在台灣能取得教師資格的人為了要達成這個目的，我必須要證明我在使用中文上很有能力因此，大部分我的作業是有關中英的翻譯
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing punctuation
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Because you planned to teach English in Taiwan, the course required you to prove that you have the competence in dominating Chinese.So you have to complete the assignments given by the course and they are about translating sentences
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the assignments given by the course.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'dominating' before the noun 'Chinese', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'dominating' instead of 'having' to express competence in Chinese, which is an incorrect word choice.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，而且我還被要求加強我的口說以及寫作能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So back to the message. You said that it is your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我還記得這個句子當我拿這個中文句子的時候，我不知道怎麼把它翻成英文你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說總是比較難了解我需要一些幫助，所以我向我的同事請求幫助我請她幫我翻這個句子，然後將答案用簡訊傳給我
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by their colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not in correct English word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used incorrect word choices in their translation.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user did not accurately interpret the difficulty of recognizing Chinese characters for foreigners.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean you asked how to translate the sentence to your colleague and she sent the answer to you through texts, right?That is to say, the text is only an answer for an assignment.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text, specifically the part about asking the colleague in Chinese and receiving the answer in English through texts.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the critical context of the text being an answer for an assignment.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect in the sentence 'You mean you asked how to translate the sentence to your colleague and she sent the answer to you through texts, right?' It should be 'You mean you asked your colleague how to translate the sentence and she sent the answer to you through texts, right?'

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那封簡訊只是我一份作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '只是' (only) in the wrong position in the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
 Now, please look at the page 14 to 16 of the investigatory file.Please look at them. They are the content of the messages. Are these messages all sent for doing the homework?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，這些簡訊的功用都是為了幫助我完成作業

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then the wife suspected that you have an affair with your colleague 彩燕王. What is your opinion?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事情真的是想太多了我知道她對我的養家能力非常不滿我希望庭上可以知道，在我在進修的時候，她從來沒有提供任何幫助給我她很不願意幫助我完成我的進修學業如果她有願意幫忙的話，我就沒有必要我問同事了我認為她要為這些誤解負責

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your responses, it seems that there are some problems between you and your wife.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
 我們剛結婚的時候，我們的確過得很開心但我的就業卻是個問題我嘗試在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是卻沒有辦法有很穩定的工作時數所以我的工作就變成我們兩個之間很大的問題我們常常為這件事情吵架她並不相信我已經盡力了 她完全沒辦法理解我遇到的困難和挫折

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s go back to the Master degree course you just mentioned.When did you begin the course of the Master degree?

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春季的時候開始上課的她是一個兩年的課程我應該要在2012年12月的時候完成這課程但是我並沒有完成這個學業，因為我有兼職工作，造成我沒有時間完成我的作業如同我之前所說的，我老婆並不很支持我我覺我是一個人孤軍奮戰地追求這個學業我感到很累而且很挫折
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'first' before 'started'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我在2010年春季的時候開始上課的她是一個兩年的課程'
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	omitted 'because' before '我有兼職工作'
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	omitted 'to do' after '沒有時間完成我的作業'
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	omitted 'all' before 'alone'
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	omitted 'and' before 'too frustrated'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You said the degree is a two-year program and you failed to finish it.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the reason for not finishing the program.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我當時沒有辦法完成要求的課程
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
Then, when did the last semester you registered end?

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個學期結束在2012年的秋季
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, since your course ended on fifth, December, 2012, after that, you shouldn’t have any assignment, should you? However, the messages you texted with your co-worker continued six months after you finished the course.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我雖然沒有完成那個學業，但這並不代表我不想增進我自己的語言能力啊雖然我沒有完成這個學業，我還是想要增進我的語言能力，所以我就開始自修
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	repetition of '雖然我沒有完成這個學業'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我還是想要增進我的語言能力'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Even that you didn't finished the degree, you still wanted to improve your Chinese, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，就是為什麼我會尋求我同事的幫忙
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the character of your co-worker is more like a tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'home tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她並不只是一個家教，她是我真正的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her money?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you pay her money?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經想付她錢，但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我曾經想付她錢' instead of '我曾經想她付錢'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn't pay her, why did she text you back in such a midnight? Does it already beyond co-woker's relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這也就是為什麼我說她是一個很支持我的朋友嘛她願意犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學習中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是一個很支持我的朋友'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the phrase 'using her own time'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the phrase 'to help me learn Chinese'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order of the sentence.

Yes, I am still working there.
是，我仍然在那裡任職
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'working' which is a critical detail in the original text.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does the co-worker, 彩燕王, still work there, too?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the name order of the co-worker, which is a critical detail in Chinese culture.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她還那裡任職，但是我們並沒有一起搭檔教學了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是我們並沒有一起搭檔教學了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any further witness to subpoena or investigation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want subpoena the co-worker, 彩燕王, form the伯元cram school as a witness. I want her to explain the relationship between the defendant and her. I also want her to explain the context of these messages and the purpose.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'as' in the phrase 'as a witness'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' before the object '彩燕王', resulting in incorrect word order.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after the phrase 'the co-worker'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'subpoena' instead of 'summon' to convey the idea of calling 彩燕王 as a witness.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '伯元補習班' as '伯元cram school', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '補習班' (cram school).

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintill, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the word order of 'plaintiff' and 'court' in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school did take some actions about their relationship.They even did try to persuade 彩燕王 to resign. I don't know if there is a posibility to confirm this thing.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'queen' before '彩燕王'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'did' before the subject 'try', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'persuade' instead of 'convince', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendent, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?Now the situation is that your course already ended on fifth, December, 2012.There is no reson that you texted each other for helping you with your assignments.Especially, the messages you texted each other are after nine p.m. It is very doubtfull.Do you have any evidence that may help for your case?

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不出任何可以幫助我的證據就如同我之前說的，我和我同事之間的溝通很簡單 我只是想要增進我的語言能力並加強中文
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So we set the next cout date at four thirty p.m. on ninth, June, 2014 to ask questions to the witness.Plaintiff and defendant, please show your attendence at that day.If necessary, you can have your own lawyers. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我明白。
Yes, I do.

今天庭期到此結束。
Today's court ends here.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'session' which is a critical detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'today' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'ends'.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re here for the adultery case, preparatory procedure. the plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case.it is mainly because she thinks that her husband, John Anderson, has an intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school.the plaintiff also found some intimate messages in the defendant’s cell phone.in addition, the defendant also made up reasons for extra working hours, and held tele-conferencing very often.What the plaintiff has found is beyond co-workers’ relationship.Therefore, she filed the case.the defendant, your wife filed you with adultery case. What’s your plea?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you been married?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve been married for four years, and we don’t have any child.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out the word 'have' before 'any child'

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
i met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that they are married.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'came' before the subject 'he', which is incorrect in English.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'for teaching' instead of 'to teach', which changes the meaning slightly.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past few years, he works as a Portuguese teacher in Taiwan. Is that right?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'works' should be in the past tense 'worked' to match the context of the past few years.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
He was a Portuguese teacher when we met. After our marriage, he kept on being a Portuguese teacher. But since Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so he stopped teaching. Sometimes he didn’t work for one or two months. Later on, because he wanted to have a stable income, he started to teach English. Because his mother tongue is not English, he seeked an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he’s seeking an advanced degree, so he decided to study in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the person is seeking an advanced degree.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context that the person is studying in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. he hopes to teach English in Taiwan. What he really wants to obtain is an TESOL degree. He found a distance learning program in California online. So that he wouldn’t have to go to the states in order to get the degree. He only has to get it through distance online learning. After the program, he will obtain the master degree. His plan is through this program of TESOL, he could find a job as an English teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '關於英語教學的' as 'TESOL degree' instead of 'degree about English teaching'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of '函授的方式' (through correspondence) in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'through distance online learning' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'he only has to get it'.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what’s the relationship between him and the person he has affair with?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They’re colleague in the same cram school. The school arranged a system. They require a Chinese teacher to work with a foreign teacher, and she is his partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know their affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'about' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'their' before 'affair' instead of after, resulting in incorrect word order.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At the very beginning, I noticed that he usually worked extra hours. I’ve asked him about this several times. It is a cram school. Why did he work that late? He told me that because he has a Chinese partner, he needs to negotiate some issues with her. At the very beginning, I trust him. Later on, I found that he often got some phone calls. He wouldn’t take them until he is away from me. Then I started to doubt everything, so I checked his phone book.

omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	skipping the sentence about the wife checking the husband's phone

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there anything weird you found?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'weird' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his calling history, I usually saw the same number. Then I was curious about his messages. After that, I found he texted a girl almost every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific content of the text messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Even if they texted each other every day, is that really wrong? Or you found something wrong in their message content?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they were normal messages, I’ll just get through it. But he’s a married person, how can he receive intimate messages from a girl? Previously I have provided the court with some messages. They should be in the file.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see page 13 on document 1. There are some messages. Defendant, please check. Are they the messages in your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的它們是
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I would like to ask some questions about the messages. The first one was sent on 9:50 PM, November, 31 in 2012, and it is from the number 0958-932. It wrote 我真的很想你 I really miss you. What’s your explanation?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
是我同事傳來的。我記得那時候我請了兩天假，他有點擔心。也就是為甚麼他傳這封簡訊給我，他在美國接受教育，所以她比較開放。這就是他講話的方式，至於我所說的「愛」，這就是我們關心別人的方式。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence structure.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Incorrect use of pronouns.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect translation of 'colleague' and 'concerned'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Misinterpretation of 'open-minded' and 'care'.
cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	Misinterpretation of 'my love' as a way of calling people we care about.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that the message sender was educated in the states, so her ideas were quite westernized. Then she was quite open-minded about expressing her love. So the word “our love” doesn’t mean too much. Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '我的愛' as 'our love' instead of 'my love'.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然啊，這在好朋友之間很平常，我們都是這麼說的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation does not capture this meaning.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the last sentence?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，他有點擔心我，我們是工作上的搭檔耶。當我離開工作兩天，他當然會想我啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們是工作上的搭檔' (We are partners at work).
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the person mentioned is a 'she' in the original text.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context that the speaker was away for two days, which is important for understanding why the other person missed them.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So do you mean that because you had two days off and away from work. So she’s worried. Without your assistance at work, so she misses you. That’s all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，那就是當時的情境，整個簡訊並沒有甚麼大不了
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Then the second message that we’re showing is sent at 11:55 PM on 13, January on 2013. It’s also from the same number. The content is “I want to..我想要你在我身邊，我們甚麼時候可以真正在一起？” can you tell me why she wrote like this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他寫這封簡訊給我因為他想要問我這個句子的…
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed in the translation.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So she wrote the message to you because you asked her to help you with a project?

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太先前所說的，我正在進修碩士。在那個學程之中，我要修三十學分才能取的學位。很自然地，我就要寫作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information about completing assignments and exercises.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '很自然地' (naturally) in the wrong position in the sentence.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you make it clear that what is your master degree about?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
是英語教學。在這個課程中，大部分的課程都跟英語教學有關，然後其中一部分是跟語言及文化的能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you’re seeking a master degree on English teaching, and there’s some courses about cultures and languages. Is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，至少有三門課跟文化還有語言相關。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of courses in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '至少有三門課' (at least three courses) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb '有' (were).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '相關' (related) instead of 'communication' to translate 'communication'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
And this kind of cultural courses, what’s the assignment like?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
文化及溝通課程的作業每個人都不一樣。以我自己為例，我目前人在台灣，然後正在攻讀英語教學的碩士學位。為了要達成這個目標而且證明我的能力，我必須要證明我有中文的能力。所以很多我的作業是翻成中文的句子。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan. So the exercise in the courses ask you to show… that’s the reason why you need to finish some homework. And the homework is mainly about Chinese and English translation.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對，我要磨練自己的口說還有寫作技巧。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So let’s go back to the message. This is your homework, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這個句子的時候，我不知道怎麼用英文表達。因為有些中文字對外國來講，很難去辨認。我需要幫助，所以我就請我同事幫我。我請他幫我翻譯這個句子，然後用訊息傳給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by the colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not in the correct word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'colleague' instead of 'her' to refer to the person who helped with the translation.
cultural transformation	inadequate handling of greetings and etiquette	The user did not include any greetings or polite expressions in their translation.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that because you had an assignment, and you turned to her for help, so she sent the message for you. Is that right? In other words, the message is the answer of the homework, right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding of the original meaning

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那只是作業的答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the homework assignment.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then we’re going to see on page 14 to page 16. All the messages. Please verify the content. Are they all the answers of your homework?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，他們都是我的作業，全部都只有一個目的，就是為了完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the messages being referred to in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '全部都只有' before the subject '他們', resulting in incorrect word order.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
For the point of your wife saying you have an affair with your colleague 彩燕王. What’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's statement about the affair.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'your wife' after the verb 'saying', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '同事王彩燕' as 'colleague 彩燕王' instead of 'colleague Wang Caiyan'.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
她想太多了，我知道他對我支持家庭並不滿意。我想讓庭上了解的是，在我碩士課程的剛開始，他就沒有提供任何協助。她不想要幫我完成學位。如果他願意幫一點點忙的話，我就不用請我同事幫忙。關於這一切的誤解，他要負最大的責任。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, the relationship between both of you doesn’t seem good.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚的時候，我們的確有段開心的日子。但我的就業造成了一些問題。我想要在台灣交葡萄牙文，但是授課時數並不穩定。所以我的工作便造就了一切問題。我們常為這件事吵架。他不相信我已經盡了全力，我也不知道怎麼讓他了解我的挫折還有困難。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So let’s go back to the master degree program. When did the program start?

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年的春天開始的。是兩年的課程。我在2012的十二月應該要結束。因為我那時候有兼職的工作，沒有足夠的時間完成作業，所以沒有準時畢業。如我先前所說的，我太太不願意幫忙。我覺得我是獨自一人追求那個學位。我很累也很挫折。
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'I first started the program'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'It was a two-year program'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'I should have finished the program in December 2012'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments'

omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'I became too tired and too frustrated'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean it is a two-year degree, and you didn’t finish it in time. Why is that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法完成課堂作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when was the last semester you registered?

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
是在2012年的秋天。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the specific information about the last semester of registration.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If what you have said is true, the last day of your semester should be on December 15th, 2012. So after the program, you won’t have any assignment. Is that right? But the intimate messages continued even six months later after your program.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	incorporating superfluous words or phrases

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我沒有作業了，我也想要精進我的中文。雖然我沒有辦法取得那個學位了，我還是想要持續進修，成為獨立學習中文的人。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even if you don’t have the courses, you still want to improve your Chinese, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為甚麼我請我同事幫忙。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of asking for help from a colleague.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So she is like a tutor for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of '家教囉', which means 'like a tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是像一個家教，他也像一個真正的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
我想要付錢，可是他拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The subject and verb should be in the correct order.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why does she want to send the messages at midnight when most people are asleep. Isn’t it beyond what a co-worker would do?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我說他非常支持我啊。他用他自己的時間幫我學中文
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'she' as '他' (he) instead of '她' (she).
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The user used the wrong pronoun '他' (he) instead of '她' (she).

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Did you still work in the same cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'work' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
對
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the workplace.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
So your colleague 彩燕王also work there now?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user switched the order of the names '彩燕王' and 'colleague' in the translation.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
他還是在那邊上班，可是我們不是夥伴了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '可是我們不是夥伴了' instead of '我們不是夥伴了可是'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there anything that you want the court to investigate? Or any person to subpoena?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific question about further witnesses or evidence that the prosecutor wants to subpoena.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena his colleague 彩燕王 who is working at 伯元 cram school as a witness. I would like to ask her to explain the messages and her relationship between the defendant.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details about the purpose of subpoenaing 彩燕王 and the background of the messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the possessive pronoun 'his' after the noun 'colleague', which is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'his colleague'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after the introductory phrase 'I would like to subpoena his colleague'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'subpoena' instead of 'invite' or 'request'. 'Subpoena' implies a legal order to appear in court, while in this context, the intention is to invite 彩燕王 as a witness.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '證人身分' as 'witness', but it should be translated as 'witness status' or 'witness capacity'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there anything that you want the court to investigate?

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has taken some action for the affair of them. And I also heard that they persuaded the woman 彩燕王 to resign. Is there the possibility to ask the cram school to explain about that?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate? The thing is the program ended on December 15, 2012. You can’t just explain your relationship with 彩燕王 through the purpose of finishing the homework. Especially your messages were usually sent during 9 to 12 PM. That is really doubtful. Do you have any evident that may help you in the case.
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到法庭能替我調查的事情。如我所說的，我和我同事的通訊，理由都很簡單。我只想要精進我的中文。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court date would be on 4:30 PM, June, 9th, 2014 for the inquiry procedure. Please make sure that you will be here. If necessary, you can have a lawyer with you.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's presence in court.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for preparatory procedure of adultery. The plaintiff files this case. The main reason that she files this case is because her husband has intimate relationship with his colleague. The plaintiff found some message in her husband’s cell phone. And her husband will use some excuse to chat with his colleague on the internet by tele-conferencing way. The message found by plaintiff showed that the relationship between her husband and his colleague is beyond colleague relationship. So, she files this case. Defendant, for what your wife said, what’s your plea?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long you got married with your husband? Do both of you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We got married for four years, and we don’t have children.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'me and my husband' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'got' instead of 'have' in the translation, resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or other country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you and your husband get married in Taiwan or in another country?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We got known each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan, and the main purpose is teaching Portugese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'We got known each other in Taiwan.' It should be 'We got to know each other in Taiwan.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'known' should be 'to know' to convey the correct meaning.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker's husband came to Taiwan four years ago.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the husband's main purpose was teaching Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
For these years, did your husband just teach Portugese?

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we just meet each other, he was teaching Portugese. After we got married, he was still teaching Portugese. However, the Portugese class is not very common in Taiwan, so his teaching hours is not very stable. Sometimes, a period between the class will be 1~2 month. For fixed income, he started want to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he wanted to get an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
The advanced degree that you just mentioned means that he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the subject's decision to pursue further education.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'wanted' before the subject 'he', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'get a degree' instead of 'pursue further education'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he tried to get a degree of teaching English. He found a learning program on the internet from California. This program makes him can have on-line learning, and he didn’t need to go to Unite States for these classes. After the classes, he can get the degree. For this plan, he tried to get the degree and find a related job.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship that he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in the cram school. The cram school set the Chinese teacher and foreign teacher program. And that woman is his partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'how' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'did' before the subject 'you' instead of after.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
In the beginning, I just know that my husband would stay in the school for more hours. I asked him so many times: why he should stay in the school for more hours. It’s just a cram school. He told me that he has a partner, and he has to communicate with his partner for long time. In the beginning, I didn’t think too much. After that, I found he would get some calls in home. And he would avoid get the phone call around me, and he would get the phone call in study room. It made me very suspicious, and I started to check his cell phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find any evidence in his cell phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of 'evidence' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'find' before the subject 'you' in their translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I used to see the same number in his cell phone. I am so suspicious, so I started to check his message. After that, I found that he almost sent the message to same woman every day.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific information about the content of the messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'so' in the wrong position in the sentence.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
What’s inappropriate thing in the message?

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If that’s a common message, it’s alright. But he got married, how can he have intimate message with others? I just provided some message to the court, and it supposed to be in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '很親密的字句' as 'intimate message' instead of 'intimate words or phrases'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court in the translation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see the investigatory file one of page13. There are some messages. Defendant, please see these pages. Is from your cell phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details of the messages mentioned in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'one' after 'investigatory file' instead of before it.

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'cell phone' instead of 'mobile phone' as the translation for '手機' in the original text.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機裡面的簡訊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '裡面' (inside) in the wrong position in the sentence.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I have some questions about these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50PM on November 31, 2012. And it’s from the cell phone number 0958-932… And the content is “我非常想你，我的愛” what that means?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
恩，那是由我同事傳給我的簡訊。我記得那時候我有兩天的休假，他非常擔心我，這就是為什麼他傳這個簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國接受教育，她非常開放。那就是她說話的方式。關於簡訊裡面的字眼，那只是我們稱呼對方的一種方式。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added information about the colleague being educated in the US and being open-minded
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added information about the meaning of 'my love'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So, you mean that because she stayed in the foreign country, her thinking way is westernized. And the way she showed the feeling is open-minded. So, there is no further explanation for “my love,” is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
並沒有甚麼其他的意思，那只是好朋友之間的一種稱呼，就僅只於這樣而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, but the user's translation does not capture this meaning.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the sentence before that?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就如同我之前所說，她很擔心我，而且我們只是同事當我連續休了兩天假後，她只是很擔心我。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that they are partners at work.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '只是同事' (just colleagues) in the wrong position, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So, you mean that because you had two days off, she was worried about you and sent that message for you? Because she didn’t have your assistance, she missed you. That’s all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
沒錯，就是這樣。簡訊的內容並不是甚麼大問題。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the message being a text message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was from the same person. It was sent at 11:55 PM, in January 13 2013. 訊息內容是〝我好希望你在我身邊，我們甚麼時候才能有正當的關係呢?〞What that sentence means?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'truly together' as '正當的關係' is incorrect. It should be translated as '真正在一起'.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她發這樣的簡訊給我只是想要讓我知道，這樣的句子如何用另外一個語言來表達。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed in the translation.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that the purpose of message just want to help you to do the assignment, what’s that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我之前所說的，我有一個遠距教學的課程。在那個課程中我需要修習三十個學分才能完成那個課程。當然在課程中，我必須要完成一些作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of attending a Master's program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '就像我之前所說的' (as I mentioned before) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after '我有一個遠距教學的課程' (I had a distance learning course).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在那個課程中' (in that course) after '我需要修習三十個學分才能完成那個課程' (I needed to complete 30 credits to finish that course) instead of before.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of needing to complete assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you just explain about your degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the degree.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我修習的課程是英語教學。課程主要的內容是英語教學、文化以及語言能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So, the degree that you got is TESOL, and there are some culture classes in that degree, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'TESOL' in their translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the word 'degree' in their translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
沒錯，我記得大概有三個課程是有關於文化和溝通的部分。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'at least' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '沒錯' (correct) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb '記得' (remember).
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '部分' (part) instead of '課程' (courses), which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What’s the assignment about these classes?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'assignment' in their translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
在課程中，指派的作業對於每個人來說都不太一樣。舉我的例子來說，我是一個在台灣想要教英文的人。為了這個目的我必須在課程中展現我有能力表達好中文。因此，我的作業中有很多是關於中文翻譯的部分。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to have the competence of … For that purpose, you had to complete the assignment about translation, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific language proficiency required for teaching English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，我必須增進我的說和寫能力。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'also' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '增進' (improve) before the object '我的說和寫能力' (my speaking and writing skills), which is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, we just go back to that sentence. You mean that the sentence is just for your assignment, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
沒錯我記得那個句子。當我看到那個中文句子後，我並不知道那句子的中文意思是甚麼意思，你知道的阿!有些中文句子對於外國人來說是非常困難的，我需要一些幫助，所以我請我同事幫忙，我請我的同事幫忙翻譯並以簡訊方式寄給我。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	incorrect use of pronouns
grammar and structure	preposition errors	incorrect use of prepositions
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So, you mean that you just asked her to translate. And she just translated it and sent it to you, is that right? This message is just the answer for the assignment, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now, we are going to show you the investigatory file one page14~16. Please see the content of these pages. So, the main purpose of these messages just for the assignment, so she sent that messages for you, is that right, is that right?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，所有的簡訊內容都只是為了要完成我的作業而已。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the messages being referred to.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation of adultery between your colleague and you filed by your wife?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我的太太對於這件事情非常感冒，我知道她對於這件事情危害家庭有很大的不悅。我想要告訴庭上的是，她其實對於我的這個並沒有甚麼太大的幫助，他並不希望我得到學位，要是如果她有一點意願幫助我，我也不用去請我的同事幫忙，我覺得她應該因為這件事情遭到譴責。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, both of you didn’t get along with each other …

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們剛結婚不久時，我們過得很開心。但問題就出在我的工作，我只是想要在台灣教葡萄牙文。但我的授課時數真的很少，所以我的工作成為我們相處之間的問題，我們為了這件事情一直爭吵，他不相信我已經盡了最大努力，我不知道要怎麼跟她說我的挫折。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
We just go back to the degree that you mentioned. When did you start you your program? Did you get the degree?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific mention of 'master's program' in their translation.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在102的春季課程開始的，那是一個為期兩年的課程。我必須在103年的12月完成課程。我並沒有完成我的課程，因為我有一個兼職工作，所以我時間不夠去做那些作業。就如同我之前所說，我的老婆並不支持我，我覺得我一直在靠我自己的能力去追求那些課程，我開始感到很疲倦而且挫折。
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'first' in 'I first started the program'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'It was' in 'It was a two-year program'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'because' in 'I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'to do' in 'didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments'
omission or addition	omission of details	omitted 'by myself' in 'I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So, you mean that the program is for two years. And you didn’t finish that program, what’s the reason?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我不能完成課程中的所有作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out the word 'requirement'

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
What is the last registration semester of your program?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個註冊學期是在103年。
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user translated 'fall 2012' as '103年', which is the year in the Taiwanese calendar. The correct translation should be '2012年'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If all you said is true, it supposed that you would not have any assignment after December 5 2012. The message sent between your colleague and you last six months after the semester, what’s the reason?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'supposed' instead of 'suppose'
cultural transformation	misinterpreting historical or social context	misunderstanding the context of the conversation

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
恩，我沒有完成那個課程並不代表我想要停止精進我的語言能力。即使我沒有完成那個課程，我還是想要精進我的中文能力
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So, you meant that even if you failed to get that degree, you want to make your Chinese more fluent by yourself, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
沒錯，那就是我為什麼要請我同事幫忙的原因。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
You mean that your colleague is just a role of tutor, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她並不只是一個家教而已，她也是我的好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay for her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經試圖給她錢，但是她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經試圖給她錢，但是她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay to her, why would she send that message for you even if in the mid-night. Is that beyond co-worker relationship?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我之前所說，她只是一個熱心助人的朋友。她運用很多時間來幫助我學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我之前所說，她是一個熱心助人的朋友。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific subject of the sentence, which is 'you'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'are' before the subject 'you', which is incorrect in English.

Yes, I am still working there.
沒錯，我還在那裡教書。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'teaching' in their translation.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is that colleague still in that cram school?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific name of the colleague, '王彩燕' (Wang Caiyan).

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
沒錯，她仍然在那裏工作，但我們已經不再搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們已經不再搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經不再搭檔了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Does the prosecutor want to have more any evidence or witness?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena the witness of defendant’s colleague, Tsai Yan Wang. We want her to explain the background and purpose of that message.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague's workplace, which is important for understanding the context.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not mention the relationship between the witness and the defendant, which is crucial information.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Does the defendant want the court to find some evidences for you?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff as the one requesting the court to find evidence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user inverted the subject and verb in the sentence.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I just heard that the cram school took some steps for them. And they tried to persuade his colleague to leave the cram school. Can we check this?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific details about the relationship between the two people and the actions taken by the cram school.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'his colleague' before the verb 'to leave', resulting in incorrect word order.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you want the court to find some evidences for you? The situation is that you finished the program on December 5 2012. You should not have the excuses of doing homework for sending the message. Particularly, both of you sent the message for each other after 9:00 PM, it’s very doubted. Do you have any evidence for your case?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master's degree and the date it ended.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the date before the year, which is incorrect in English.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '希望' as 'want' instead of 'hope'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '起人疑竇' as 'very doubted' instead of 'raise suspicion'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's interaction with Wang Caiyan in the original text.
omission or addition	skipping entire sentences or paragraphs	The user skipped the sentence about the defendant's interaction with Wang Caiyan after 9:00 PM.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase 'for your case' at the end of the translation.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我無法想到有甚麼證據可以幫助我的案子，就如同我之前所說，我和我同事之間的簡訊只是平凡的簡訊而已。我只是想精進我的中文能力而已。

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So, the next court day will be set at 4:30, in June 9 2014, and it will be the witness inquiry procedure. Please both of you should make it. If it’s necessary, both of you can have lawyers, is that clear?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我明白。
Yes.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, I want to ask the plaintiff, how long have you married, and do you kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after 'married'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should be 'have you' to match the subject 'plaintiff'.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The term 'plaintiff' is not translated.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have already married for four years, and we do not have kid.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'have' instead of 'has'.
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a period at the end of the sentence.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The term '結婚' should be translated as 'get married' instead of 'married'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Do you marry your husband in Taiwan or in other country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you marry your husband in Taiwan or in another country?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan as a Portuguese teacher.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is also from Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase 'Four years ago' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '想要' as 'as' instead of 'to'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
During those years, did he teach Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met, he was a Portuguese teacher, and after we married, he still taught Portuguese. But Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan; therefore his teaching hours are not stable. Sometimes he might did not have any class between one or two months. Because he wanted to make our financial status more stable, therefore he started to taught English. But his mother tongue is not English; therefore, he sought an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mention before that he sought an advanced degree, do you mean he studies a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '進修' as 'sought an advanced degree' instead of 'studied a degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he hoped to teach English in Taiwan, therefore, he have to get the degree of the TESOL. On the Internet, he found a distance learning program provided by California school. He did not have to go to the US, and can learn on-line. After he finishes the classes, he can get the degree. His plan is to find an English teacher job in Taiwan by getting an US degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'he have to get the degree of the TESOL'

omission or addition	omission of details	omission of the word 'the' before 'English teacher job in Taiwan'

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Can you explain the relationship between your husband and the woman in this case?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in cram school. In the cram school, they have the system of a foreigner teacher partner with a Chinese teacher, and they are partners.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the female person mentioned is the Chinese teacher in the original text.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they are having an affair?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I found that my husband started to stay at the cram school for a long time. I asked him many times “It is just a cram school, why did you have to stay there so long?” He told me that because he had to partner with a Chinese teacher, and they had to cooperate with each other. At first, I did not suspect he is having an affair with her. But after a while, I noticed that, my husband would get some phone calls after he came home. When he received those phone calls, he did not speak the phone directly in front of me, instead going to the study room. That is the reason why I checked the information in his cell phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything strange in his cell phone?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'his' at the end of the sentence instead of at the beginning, resulting in incorrect word order.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
 I saw his phone calls always from one number, so I was curious about the text messages and I checked them. After I checked the messages, I found that he almost chatted with a woman everyday.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the specific content of the text messages, which is a critical detail.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
I think it is okay to text messages, is anything wrong in the content?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If those messages’ content are normal, that will be okay. But he is a married man, how could he let a girl to text him some intimate messages? I have provided some content of the messages, I think they might in the investigation file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '簡訊內容' as 'content of the messages' instead of 'messages' content'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omits the mention of providing the messages to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please check page 13, file one. There are some messages content, please check them. Are these your messages from your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對，這些是我電話中的簡訊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '電話' (phone) before '中' (in), which is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I have some question about the message content. The first message is from the cell phone 0958-932xxx at 9:50 p.m., on December thirty first, 2012. The content is 我非常想你 可以請你解釋一下嗎?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I really miss you, my love' as '我非常想你' is not accurate. '非常' means 'very' or 'extremely', but 'really' in this context means 'truly' or 'sincerely'. Also, 'my love' is not translated in the user's translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想你非常', not '我非常想你'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation does not include the critical context of the message being sent on November 31st, 2012 at 9:50 p.m. from the cell phone number 0958-932xxx.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事發來的。我記得那陣子，我休了兩天的假。她可能有點擔心吧。這就是她發給我這封簡訊的原因。我同事在美國受過教育，他非常開放，這是她的講話方式啊!至於她稱呼我是她的愛人，這只是她的一個稱呼罷了。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word
cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	misinterpreting the tone

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that because the people was educated in the USA, and she is westernized, and she is open minded to express her feeling, so the name, my love, does not mean a lot?

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
這只是普通朋友間很常見的稱呼，或者是表達你對你很親密朋友的關心罷了
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the expression is common between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other, while the user's translation suggests that it is a common expression between ordinary friends or to express care for a close friend.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous line?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我說啦，她很擔心我，我們是夥伴啊!當我請了兩天的假以後，她當然會開始想我阿。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們是夥伴啊，她很擔心我。'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '開始想我' in the translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'naturally missed me' in the original text.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You are saying that because of your two days off, she texted you this kind of message. Without your help in the work, she missed you a lot. Is that all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the person missed the user a lot due to the user's absence from work.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
這封簡訊就沒甚麼大不了的，內容是很普遍的， 這只是很單純的簡訊。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the message being discussed.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The next message was from the same cell phone at 11:55 p.m., on January thirteenth, in 2013.內容是我想要你在我身逼，甚麼時候才能在一起呢? Can you explain the content?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'by my side'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '在我身逼'
omission or addition	omission of details	missing 'truly' in '甚麼時候才能在一起呢?'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她發簡訊給我，只是為了告訴我功課的中文該如何表達的一句話
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Do you mean that she sent this message to you just to help you with your homework can you explain that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
我太太之前有跟庭上報告過，我正在上遠距離教學。為了得到學位，我必須完成30學分，當然啦，我就必需完成一些功課或者是作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我之前有跟太太報告過'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of attending a Master's program and instead translates it as '遠距離教學', which means distance learning. This is a significant detail that is left out.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation does not provide the context that the completion of 30 credits is required before receiving the degree.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain that what is your master degree for?

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是有關英語教學的。這個學位的課程內容有些是有關英語語言能力的、有些是有關文化跟英語教學。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the specific mention of 'courses' in the original text.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation uses '碩士學位' (master's degree) instead of 'program' which changes the meaning.
semantic conversion	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The translation does not include the translation of 'TESOL' which is an essential term in the original text.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you are saying that in your master degree, the main program is for English competence, but there are some culture classes?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得課程裡有3門課程是有關文化溝通的。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'at least' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '對' (yes) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '課程' (courses) instead of '課程裡' (in the courses) which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
Can you tell me the homework of the culture communication classes?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'homework' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'tell' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這門課裡，每個學生的作業都是因人而異的。以我自己為例的話，我在台灣想要當一名英文老師，為了達到這個目的，我需要證明我有足夠的語言能力，尤其是對中文的掌握。所以我的功課內容很多是有關中英語間的翻譯。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using the wrong word

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Your plan is to teach in Taiwan. Therefore, you have to prove you have the Chinese competence. So you have to finish some assignments, and that is about translation between Chinese and English, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the specific requirement of the master's course.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'finish' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
我還必須加強我的寫作和口語能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, let’s go back to the next point. You said that is your homework, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
我記得這句話。當我拿到這句話的中文時，我不知道要怎麼把它翻成英文。你知道的，中文對外國人來說是很難辨識的，它們都長得一樣。我需要一些幫助，所以我就請我的同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯這句話，再把這句話寄給我。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using incorrect words

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You are saying that you gave your college the Chinese sentence, and she translated it into English and sent it back to you. Is that right? In other words, the content of this message is just a part of your assignment, is that right?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase '作業的解答' (assignment's answer) from the translation.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
這封簡訊的內容，就只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the homework assignment.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now, please check page 14 to 15 of file one, the content of all messages. Please check those messages. Are they all your assignments, and you ask your co-workers to help you?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
這些簡訊都只有一個目的，就是為了幫助我完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the details of the messages being referred to.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, as for the accuse from you wife that you are having affair with Cai Yan Wang, what is your explanation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了。我知道她覺得我對家庭的付出不夠。我想要強調，再我求學的這段過程，我太太一開始完成沒有支持我。她不希望幫助我完成我的學業，如果她願意幫助我的話，我根本就不需要請我的同事幫我。我覺得她應該為造成這種誤解負責。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, I think there might be some misunderstanding between you and your wife.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們剛結婚時真的很甜蜜。但我的工作造成我們之間的問題，我試著在台灣教葡萄牙，但我的授課時數一直很不穩定，所以我的工作問題就造成我們兩個之間的不和，我們為了我的工作常常吵架。她不相信我已經近全力在工作了，我也不知道我要怎麼表達我己經…我的沮喪、我的難過

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, let’s back to your master degree. When did you start your master degree? Did you finish? ….When was it?
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the question about whether the person obtained the degree or not.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the question about when the master degree started after the question about whether it was finished or not.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年的春天開始課程的。這是一個兩年的課程。我本來應該在2012年的12月拿到學位。可是我並沒有拿到學位，因為我必須在台灣做兼職工作，而我沒有很多時間來做我的作業。像我之前說的，我太太並不支持我。我覺得我在追求學位的時候是一個很孤單的過程，我覺得太疲累、太沮喪。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	added information about working in Taiwan

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	translated 'degree' as '學位' instead of '課程'
cultural transformation	inaccurately translating humor or sarcasm	misinterpreted the humor in 'my wife has never been very supportive'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
Did you mean the program is a two-year program but you did not finish the course? Why?
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法完成課程的要求。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When was your last semester registration?

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋天。
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase '的秋天' which is not present in the original text.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If you are telling the truth, the last day of your registration was December fifth, 2012. So after the day, basically you do no have any homework, is that right? Can you explain why you kept contacting with your co-worker after the last day of your registration for six months?

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
恩..我沒有拿到學位，但不代表我不想增進我的中文能力。雖然我沒有拿到學位，我也想要練習我的中文，所以我一直自學。
omission or addition	omission of details	leaving out critical context

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even though you fail to finish the degree, but you still want to improve your Chinese and make you speak Chinese fluently?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，所以我才請我的同事幫忙。
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
