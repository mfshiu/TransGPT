我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?

對，就是這把傘。

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的那種' as 'quite normal' instead of 'ordinary type'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'According to this point, I did explain to the police station about the button on the umbrella.'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。

新北市三峽區學府路132號5樓之4

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (took Chen Xiao Qian’s umbrella) should be translated as 借了原告陳小倩的雨傘 (borrowed Chen Xiao Qian’s umbrella)

I understand.

我了解。

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a correct translation. No obvious errors found.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'plaintiff' is translated as '原告' instead of '被告'.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐在那邊' instead of '在那邊陳小姐'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '他對我大吼' is incorrect. It should be '他大吼對我'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' should be translated as 'she' instead of 'he' since the original text refers to a female.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the person yelled at the speaker.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker tried to apologize.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'said' instead of 'asked'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'steal' before the subject 'you' instead of after

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以我們就到外面找食物吃，然後順便找找哪裡可以吃晚餐'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '當時借的傘' as 'the umbrella you borrowed' instead of 'the umbrella you borrowed at that time'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'belong' before the subject 'the umbrella', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'Adam' was translated as '艾登' instead of '亞當', resulting in a mismatched meaning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我拿的傘' instead of '我那個時候是拿'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the umbrella in their translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'not a brand new one' as '整支傘看起來沒有很新', which means 'the whole umbrella doesn't look new', but the original text only mentions that it was not a brand new one.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the entire object was blue, while the original text only mentions the color.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'proved' is incorrect. It should be 'prove'.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of pronouns
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of professor's gender

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I guess so.

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	陳小姐 should be translated as Ms. Chen instead of 陳小姐

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Miss Chen, can you elaborate on what happened that day?'

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?

對，就是這把傘。

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated the sentence by adding unnecessary information about the availability of the umbrella in convenient stores like 7-11.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the umbrella was damaged at the button and couldn't be locked properly.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'settle' before the subject 'defendant', resulting in incorrect word order.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '只是一把傘' is translated as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'it's not only about an umbrella'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the speaker may have to go back home without an umbrella if it is not returned.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they explained the broken button to the police when they reported the case.

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '只是一把傘' as 'just an umbrella' instead of 'just a matter of an umbrella.'

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

新北市三峽區學府路132號5樓之4

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?

omission or addition	omitting important details	雙方明白程序嗎? (do both of you understand the procedure?) is omitted

I understand.

我了解。

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the date is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' as '鶯歌陶瓷博物館', which is a direct translation. However, the correct translation should be '鶯歌陶瓷博物館' to accurately convey the cultural reference.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我把傘放回傘架時'.

當時發生了什麼事呢?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural references or symbols

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '說' as 'accused' instead of 'said'

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural references or symbols
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the fact that the classmates were also hungry
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Incorrect subject-verb agreement in '我和我同學看完展覽之後 覺得餓了'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the fact that the protagonist planned to borrow an umbrella
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the fact that the protagonist went to buy bread with the professor and two other friends
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the fact that Ms. Chen started yelling at the protagonist

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The name 'Adan' was mistranslated as '亞當' instead of '同學亞當'.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '我真的沒有要拿別人的傘' is translated as 'I really didn't want to take someone else's umbrella,' which changes the meaning from 'I didn't intend to steal anyone's umbrella.'

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'brand new' as '很新', which means 'very new', but the original text only states that it was not a brand new umbrella.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '整隻' as 'whole' instead of 'entire'.

In my recollection, the color was blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'recollection' as '印象' which means 'impression' instead of '回憶' which means 'memory'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the adjective '藍色的' (blue), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '藍色的是' (blue is).

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the translation.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '可以啊我從博物館出來時' is incorrect. It should be '我從博物館出來時可以啊'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我的教授甚至想借我他的傘'. It should be '我的教授甚至想借我他的傘給我'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '跟' should be translated as '和' instead of '借'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '對我而言有點太小了' should be translated as '對我來說太小了' instead of '對我而言有點太小了'.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'can' should agree with the plural subject 'they'.

I guess so.

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著想把傘還給陳小姐" is incorrect. It should be "我試著想把傘還給陳小姐".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我也試著想要道歉但她也不接受" is incorrect. It should be "我也試著想要道歉但她也不接受".

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that they asked the museum staff for help in finding their umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '鶯歌博物館' as 'Yingge Ceramics Museum' instead of 'Yingge Museum'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'was' instead of 'were' in the sentence 'Didn’t he notice that was raining outside?'.
inappropriate cultural transformation	ignoring cultural taboos or sensitivities	The user used 'lack of morality' instead of 'lack of public spirit' to describe the foreigner's behavior, which may not accurately convey the cultural context.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What color was the umbrella you brought that day?'

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'deep blue, I think', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '應該是深藍色的' (should be deep blue).

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

對，就是這把傘。

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella.' The correct word order should be 'But there is some damage/breakage at the button, so I can recognize that it was my umbrella.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I was sure that was my umbrella.' The correct form should be 'The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I am/was sure that it was my umbrella.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the detail that the user explained the damage to the police when reporting the case: 'Also I told the police as the explanation.' The correct form should be 'Also, I explained the damage to the police.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence: 'But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella.' The correct form should be 'But there is some damage/breakage at the button, which helps me recognize that it was my umbrella.'

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is there any possible to forgive him?' instead of 'Can you tell me if he is regret and willing to apologize, is there any possible to forgive him?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks if the speaker would be able to forgive the person if they show regret and are willing to apologize, while the user's translation asks if the speaker is able to forgive the person because it is just an umbrella.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '只是' as 'just' instead of 'mean' or 'about'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'should' instead of 'have to' in the conditional sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '一把傘' in the translation.

我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the instruction to the defendant to attend the court hearing.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the three people are witnesses.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not specify that the purpose of the court hearing is to explain what happened on the day of the incident.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the court date is in the afternoon.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention the specific date of the court hearing.

Yes, I will be here.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?

我了解。

那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.

當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '陳小姐就在那，當我把傘放回傘架的時候。'

當時發生了什麼事呢?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著跟她講說我只是拿錯了' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試著跟她說我只是拿錯了'.

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Ms. Chen' after the verb 'said' instead of before it.
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	The user did not include the honorific '小姐' when translating 'Ms. Chen'.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'thought' should come after the subject 'I'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the car not being brand new.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

In my recollection, the color was blue.

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I guess so.

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。

對，就是這把傘。

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the umbrella in the photo is common in Taiwan and can be bought at any convenience store, which may not be the case in other countries.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。

當時發生了什麼事呢?

She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我嘗試告訴她我不小心拿錯了' (I tried to tell her I accidentally took the wrong one). The correct word order should be '我嘗試告訴她我不小心拿錯了'.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'When I tell the police, I mentioned this point to them.' It should be 'When I told the police, I mentioned this point to them.'

新北市三峽區學府路132號5樓之4

Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the year as 2014 instead of 103 (based on the original text).

那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '陳小姐' as 'she' instead of 'Miss Chen'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'stole' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我和我同學來這邊看一個展覽' is incorrect. It should be '我和我的同學來這邊看一個展覽'.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我跟他體型比較像' is incorrect. It should be '我和他的體型比較像'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我買一些麵包給同學和教授' is incorrect. It should be '我給同學和教授買了一些麵包'.

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '麵包' should be translated as 'bread' instead of '點心'.

你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'thought' as '以為' which means 'assume' instead of '認為' which means 'believe'.

那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'blue' as '綠色' which means 'green' in Chinese.

那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'whole' is not appropriate in this context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Is the umbrella all blue?'

In my recollection, the color was blue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'In my recollection' as '我印象中', which means 'in my impression'. This does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the adjective '藍色的' (blue), which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '藍色的是' (blue is).

有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我和我教授還有同學一同出來" is incorrect. It should be "我和我教授還有兩個同學一同出來".

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I guess so.

那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我試著把這把傘還給他" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "我試著把這把傘還給他".
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence "但他也不願意接受". The correct form should be "但他也不願意接受".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word "Ms. Chen" in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'ethics' after 'lack of'.

請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '深藍色的' as 'whole blue' which does not accurately convey the meaning of '深藍色的' which means 'dark blue'.

提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?

對，就是這把傘。

照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the umbrella is easy to buy in a convenience store, instead of stating that it is a common type of umbrella that can be bought in a convenience store.

的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '妳有沒有可能原諒他呢?' as 'Is it possible that you forgive the defendant?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the user's translation.
