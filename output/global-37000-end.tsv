Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是為什麼我尋求我同事的幫忙
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague is just like a tutor teaching you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，也是我真心地朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay for her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有耶，我本來想要付錢給她但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我本來想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she texting you during the midnight, and it’s not the right time, isn’t that beyond the co-worker’s relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '在半夜應該就寢的時候' as 'during the midnight, and it’s not the right time' instead of 'when she should be sleeping at midnight'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'during the midnight' before 'texting you' instead of after it.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她真的是我的好朋友。她都利用她所有的花時間來幫助我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她利用她所有的時間'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school？
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Do you still teach English in that cram school?'

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那裡工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does the colleague still working with you in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is the colleague still working with you in that cram school?'

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她還是在那裡工作，但我們並沒有再合作了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們並沒有再合作了' instead of '但我們並沒有再合作了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have anyone to subpoena, or anything to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena the witness which means the colleague… the defendant’s colleague to the court. I want her to be the witness of the background and the message, and explain the context
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the colleague's name and the name of the tutoring center.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'which means the colleague' in an incorrect position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '證人身分' as 'witness of the background and the message', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'witness status'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you want the court to help you subpoena anyone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of any specific evidence or witnesses that the accuser wants the court to help subpoena.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the Mei-Er-Mei Cram School has taken some actions, one of these is to let Zong-Er Huang to get off …. to leave her work. I would like to subpoena the principle for the… to respond this message.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of '針對' as 'let'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form 'to get off' instead of 'to leave'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the action taken by the cram school

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you want the court to help you investigate any evidence? The defendant, your master courses have ended in May, 2017. However, the action between you and your colleague is beyond co-worker’s relationship. And it’s weird that to text the messages after 9:00 p.m. just for asking for the….having with the assignments, do you have any evidence to…for the court to investigate? And verify your suspicion?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in multiple sentences.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in 'The defendant, your master courses have ended in May, 2017.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Misinterpretation of 'the action between you and your colleague is beyond co-worker’s relationship.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in 'And it’s weird that to text the messages after 9:00 p.m. just for asking for the….having with the assignments'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of 'help' in 'do you have any evidence to…for the court to investigate?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of 'verify your suspicion' in 'And verify your suspicion?'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
基本上，我沒有要法院再進一步調查的證據了。我跟我同事真的就是單純之間的朋友互動。我就只是想要增進我的中文而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the communication between the user and their colleague.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverbial phrase '基本上' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'the court can investigate on my behalf' as '法院再進一步調查的證據了', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the next proceeding will be set on June 24th, 2018. The time is 4:30p.m. We are going to have a witness questioning procedure. For both parties, you have to be here, and you can have your own lawyers. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'The witness questioning procedure will take place on June 24th, 2018, at 4:30 p.m.'

 我明白。
I understand.

Same as the indictment.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of adultery case. The accuser is Yu-Han Wang. She filed a lawsuit against the defendant Edward Takayashi. He works in a cram school. He had some intimate messages with his coworker Rong-Er Wang. The defendant often worked overtime… He often made up a reason working overtime and he even had some tele-conferencing with Rong-Er Wang. They had beyond coworker’s relationship.The defendant, the accuser Yu-Han Wang filed a lawsuit against you for adultery. What’s your pledge?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'He works in a cram school.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'He had some intimate messages with his coworker Rong-Er Wang.' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text, which states that the accuser found intimate messages in her husband's phone records.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The translation 'He often made up a reason working overtime' should be 'He often made up a reason to work overtime.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the detail that the accuser found the intimate messages in her husband's phone records.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the detail that the accuser collected communication content that went beyond a coworker relationship.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the detail that the accuser filed a lawsuit against the defendant for adultery.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the detail that the defendant's wife suspects him of having an affair.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the detail that the defendant's wife wants to sue him for adultery.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the detail that the defendant's wife is asking for his defense.

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Of course, not guilty.'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the court will figure out the details of this case and to find whether the details are truth and can the details constitute adultery. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我明白
I understand.

I understand.

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long you have been married with your husband? Do you have child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married with your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'has you been married'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question does not include the part about having children.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years. We don’t have any child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'We don't have any children.'

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
You two got married in Taiwan or in other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. He wanted to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the user being married to the person they met in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error. Instead of saying 'We met each other', they say 'We met each other'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the last four years, he was always teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Was he always teaching Portuguese in the last four years?'

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met each other, he was a teacher teaching Portuguese. Now he is still teaching.Because not many people really want to learn Portuguese in Taiwan, his teaching hours are not stable. There is even a period of one to two months between jobs.To have a more stable income, he wants to teach English but he… his mother tongue is not English so he decided to seek advanced degree.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	lack of subject-verb agreement in 'he... his mother tongue is not English'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'after we got married'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'in Taiwan'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'to have a more stable income'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'but he... decided to seek advanced degree'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he wants to seek advanced degree. Does he want to seek a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek advanced degree' instead of 'further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English so he needed to seek a degree of English teaching.He found a distance learning program of … in California in US. So he can learn English through distance learning. So he can get the degree just through distance learning and he can have the US degree to teach English in Taiwan.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '取得的學位是關於英語教學的' as 'he needed to seek a degree of English teaching' instead of 'the degree he needed to obtain was about English teaching'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the specific distance learning program in California.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the completion of all credits required for the degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the purpose of obtaining a US degree to find a teaching job in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between he and the person he has affair with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇對象' as 'the person he has affair with' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are coworkers in cram school. There is a rule in cram school that a Chinese teacher has to partner with a foreign teacher, so the person he has affair with is his partner.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of the term 'affair'

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, he just often worked overtime. I asked him it’s just an English cram school, why did you need to work overtime. He said he had to communicate with the Chinese teacher to prepare the courses.I did not doubt him at first but he gradually… uhh.. when he went home, he always got some phone calls and he did not answer the phone calls in front of him. He always picked up the phones in study room so I started to doubt him and I check his phone.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '留在學校加班' as 'worked overtime' instead of 'stayed at school to work overtime'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the protagonist checked her husband's phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything wrong in his phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'unusual' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
He often called the same person and he sent messengers with the same one almost every single day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'called' and '簡訊' as 'messengers', which do not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order, resulting in a confusing sentence structure.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
I think it’s fine with the messages? Or the messages are inappropriate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
I am fine with the normal messages but the contents are too intimate and I have given some of the messages to the court. I think the messages are attached to the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the messages are too intimate, but the user's translation only mentions that the contents are intimate.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the person mentioned in the messages is married, which is an important detail mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the messages have been given to the court and are attached to the file, which is another important detail mentioned in the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Exhibit one, page 13, the records of the messages. The defendant, please check the exhibition. Are they messages in your phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific content of the messages.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'check' instead of 'checks'.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
對，這是我手機裡的簡訊。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I’m going to ask questions according to the messages in your phone.The first message was sent at 9:50pm on Dec 21st, 2017. It was from 0958-932123. The content is “I really miss you, my love.” What does it mean?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事發給的，因為那時候我休假兩天，她有點擔心，所有才有這個簡訊。我的同事在美國念書，她講話比較開放，那就是她表達方式，至於my love，那就是我們稱呼我們在乎的人的方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that because the person who sent you the message is educated in a foreign county, she is more open-minded. So “my love” doesn’t mean anything. Right?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿，這就是一個很普通的稱呼方式。好朋友之間就這樣。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other' to the target language.

那她前面那句呢？
what about the previous message?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我說了，那就是她關心我的話而已。我們是工作上的搭檔，所以她關心我也很正常。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我說了，她只是關心我而已。'

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean that because you took two days off, she didn’t have the assistance during the classes so she sent that kind od message to you?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對，所以才有那樣的簡訊，沒有什麼大不了的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent at 11:55pm on Dec 29th, 2017. It’s from the same person. The content is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does it mean?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這樣的簡訊告訴我怎麼樣用中文表達一件事情，那是我的功課。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她寫這樣的簡訊告訴我怎麼樣用中文表達一件事情，那是我的功課。'

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
She sent you this message to help you with the assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太所述，我有在進修，我需要修滿30個學生，所以我需要做點功課和練習也是很正常的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the Master's program and the requirement to complete 30 credits.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the phrase '也是很正常的' which is not present in the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you explain on you master degree? What’s it about?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是關於TESOL 英文教學，它除了包含教學課程以外還有包含一些文化還有本身語言能力。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' instead of '計畫'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'related to' is translated as '關於' instead of '相關'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我的課程是關於TESOL英文教學'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'some of the courses' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'culture and language competence' in the original text.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So the master degree is about English teaching but it includes some… cultural communication, right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得至少有三堂課是有關於文化和溝通。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Yes, I remember that at least three courses were related to culture and communication.'

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
For these courses of cultural communication, they gave you what kind of assignments?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'you' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通課程給的功課，會因為不同的人而不一樣。就我來說，我在台灣，我想要一個教英文的教職，那我就必須要證明我的中文能力很好。所以我有很多功課是關於中英的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這些文化溝通課程給的功課會因為不同的人而不一樣。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments are for the culture and communication courses.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments are about Chinese-English sentence translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user is seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user is in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user wants to prove their competence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user has to show a good command of Chinese.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove your Chinese competence. That’s why the course give you the Chinese translation assignments?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of completing assignments as part of the course.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'give' instead of 'gives' to match the subject 'course'.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對，當然我也有被…也有被訓練一些寫作和口說方面的能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, the messages are your assignments?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，那就是我的作業，你知道中文句子很多時候對外國人很難，我就請我的同事把句子翻譯成英文，然後再用簡訊傳給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the colleague helping with the translation.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you asked your colleague about the Chinese sentence and she translated it into English and sent it to you. This is the situation at that time? That is only the sentence of the assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那句話只是我作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Exhibition 1, page 14 to 16. Please check the messages. Are these messages only for the assignments? They are only the answers to the assignments?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，這些簡訊都是我的功課而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So about your wife mentioning you have an affair with your coworker, what’s your explanation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '那針對你太太說' as 'So about your wife mentioning', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order should be 'What's your explanation about your wife mentioning you have an affair with your coworker?'

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我覺得我的太太真的想太多了，我知道她一直嫌我不夠專注在家庭。我想要庭上知道，她打從一開始就沒有支持我，關於我對碩士學位的進修。如果她當初有在我進修的時候幫忙我，那我也不需要問我的同事，我覺得她要對她的誤解負責。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'thinks too much' as '嫌我不夠專注' which means 'complains that I am not focused enough'. The meaning is not accurately conveyed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker asked their colleague for help. This detail is important for understanding the context.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, I think there are some unpleasant moments between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們一開始結婚的時候是很快樂，但問題是我的工作，我教葡萄牙文，授課時數不穩定。所以工作成了我們爭吵的重點，我們常為這個在吵，她不相信我已經很盡力了，我也無法讓她知道我多沮喪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我們一開始結婚的時候是很快樂' should be '我們一開始結婚的時候很快樂'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我們常為這個在吵' should be '我們常為這個吵'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the fights being related to the employment issue.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the frustration and difficult situation faced by the speaker.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s come back to the Master program. When did this program start? Do you get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我從2015年秋天開始修這個碩士學位，我預計在2017年五月修完，但是我沒有拿到這個學位，因為我有一些兼職，我沒有時間去做作業。就像我剛剛說的，我的太太從來沒有幫忙過我，我一直都是一個人在做這件事情，我真的很累也很沮喪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我預計在2017年五月修完' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我預計在2017年五月修完了'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the program is a two-year program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the user didn't finish the program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the reason for not finishing the program, which is that the user didn't have enough time to do course assignments due to working part-time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我一直都是一個人在做這件事情' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我一直都是一個人在做這件事'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation of 'I became too tired and too frustrated' as '我真的很累也很沮喪' does not accurately convey the meaning of becoming tired and frustrated.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You said that this master program is a two-year course but you did not finish, why?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成課程的所有作業還有一些課程要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When is your last semester of registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後日期是2017年的春天。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
According to your last registration date, that is May 2017. After that, you wouldn’t have any assignment but the massagers with your coworker last 7 months after that. Why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '結束日期' as 'registration date' instead of 'end date'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'wouldn't' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the text being a message exchange between the speaker and their coworker.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成課程不代表我不想學好中文，我還是想要精進我的語言能力，所以我就自學了
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of failing the program in their translation.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that even though you did not finish the Master program, you still want to learn Chinese ad sharpen your Chinese ability, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
對，這就是為甚麼我請我的同事幫忙?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the role of your colleague, she is like your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'tutor' does not accurately convey the meaning of '家教' which refers to a private tutor or a home tutor.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是家教，她是一個很好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我原本想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我原本想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you did not pay her, why she still send you the message during bed time? Is it beyond coworkers’ relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
我說過她是一個很支持的朋友，她用她自己的時間來幫我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她用她自己的時間來幫我' instead of '她用她自己的時間來幫我'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我還在那工作。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does the colleague still work there too?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她還在那工作，但我們不再是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們不再是搭檔了' instead of '但不再是搭檔了我們'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, is there any witness you want to subpoena or any evidence you want to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena the coworker in cram school, that is Rong-Er Wang in May Er May cram school. She can come to court as witness and explain the details of this case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details about the relationship between the defendant and the coworker, as well as the background and purpose of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
About the coworker in cram school… I heard that people in cram people had taken some action on this matter. They tried to convince the coworker to quit. I would like to verify this matter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '美而美補習班' as 'cram people' instead of 'cram school'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'in cram school' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'coworker'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'they' in the original text, which refers to the people in the cram school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? Your course had ended in May 2017. You cannot say that your messages are just for assignments. Furthermore, your interaction of messages is over 9:00pm. It cannot really be explained. So do you have any evidence you want to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Your course had ended in May 2017.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '起人疑竇' as 'It cannot really be explained.' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '黃蓉兒' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有任何想要法庭代為調查的證據，我和同事的關係真的很簡單，我只是想要精進我的中文能力。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about wanting to continue learning Chinese.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next proceeding is at 4:30pm June 24th, 2018. We will have the procedure of questioning witness. The defendant and the accuser both need to show up. Both parties can hire a lawyer if necessary. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.
我也明白。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparation procedure of an adultery case. The accuser is yu-han Wang. Sha prosecuted her husband, Edward Takayashi, for getting too close with his coworker, 蓉兒-Huang, in the school where Takayashi works. Yu-han Wang found many pieces of intimate message in the defendant’s cellphone. The defendant often works overtime by making up reasons, and he usually make tele-conferencing with his coworker, 蓉兒-Huang. And the accuser thinks that’s beyond coworkers’ relationship. The defendant, your wife doubts that you have an affair. What’s your plea?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched names of individuals
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'prosecuted' as 'prosecuting'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of 'adultery' in the translation
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of 'sha' in the translation
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	inaccurate translation of '蓉兒-Huang' as '蓉兒-Huang'

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯，當然。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In the preparation procedure today, we will ask the defendant about those messages and see if these messages constitute an adultery. Do everybody understand the procedure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Do(es) everybody understand the procedure?'

我明白
I understand.

I understand.
我了解。

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Accuser, how long have you married with your husband? And do you have a child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years and we don’t have children.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Did you get married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. At that time, my husband came to Taiwan and wanted to teach Portuguese here
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the duration of their relationship.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'want' instead of 'wanted' to match the past tense of the sentence.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past few years, is his job teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
He was a Portuguese teacher when we get married, and he kept teaching Portuguese after we married. There are not many people in Taiwan that want to learn Portuguese. As a result, he has an unstable teaching hours and often has a period between jobs for about one or two months. Since he wanted to have more fixed income, he decided to start to teach English. Since his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'when we get married' should be 'when we got married' to match the past tense of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'There are not many people in Taiwan that want to learn Portuguese' should be 'There are not many people in Taiwan who want to learn Portuguese' to match the plural subject 'people'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'he has an unstable teaching hours' should be 'he had unstable teaching hours' to match the past tense of the sentence.
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	Article error in the sentence 'he decided to seek an advanced degree' should be 'he decided to seek advanced degree' without the article 'an' before 'advanced degree'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence 'Since his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree' should be 'Since his mother tongue is not English, he decided to seek an advanced degree' without the pronoun 'so' at the beginning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the husband's decision to teach English is related to his desire for a more stable income.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the husband's decision to teach English is related to the fact that not many people in Taiwan want to learn Portuguese.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the husband's teaching hours for Portuguese are unstable and sometimes have gaps of one or two months.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the husband's mother tongue is not English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just said he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean he wanted to earn a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that '進修' means 'seeking an advanced degree' when it actually means 'taking further education or training'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Since he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he needed to get a degree of TESOL. He found a distance learning program established in California, USA. With this program, he can do online learning at home without going to the U.S. after he earned all the credits, he can get the degree and teach English in Taiwan.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '關於英語教學' as 'TESOL' instead of 'about English teaching'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the specific degree the person needs to obtain, which is '碩士學位' (master's degree).

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then, what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are coworkers in the same cram school. The program in the cram school, they will have a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher at one class. And they are partners in the class.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of '搭檔教學' (partnership teaching).

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How do you know' instead of 'How do you know they'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
In the beginning, I found my husband often stay in the school, working over time. I ask him why he had to work overtime just working in cram school. And my husband said he partnered with another Chinese teacher, so they need a lot of communications about the class. First, I didn’t doubt him at all. However, later I found that my husband often receives several calls after work. When he received the call, he didn’t speak in front of me. Instead, he went to his study room. So I decided to check his phone.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '美語補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'English language school'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'my husband often stay' instead of 'my husband often stays'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the protagonist checked her husband's phone because of her suspicions.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find any unusual in the defendant’s cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
First, I checked his record, and found there is always a same number. Then I checked his mail. I found that he nearly every day contact a woman by mail.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '簡訊' as 'mail' instead of 'text message'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
That’s not so unusual sending a mail. Or is there anything strange?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '發簡訊' as 'sending a mail' instead of 'sending a text message'.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they are just ordinary messages, then I won’t care about them. But the woman sends some intimate words or sentences to my husband. He’s a married man! I have provided some contents to the court. I believe it’s in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了' as 'If they are just ordinary messages, then I won’t care about them', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text expresses surprise and disbelief, while the user's translation suggests indifference.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
We are presenting file 1, page 13. The defendant, please check. Are these contents of messages the ones in your cellphone?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
對，這是我手機裡面的簡訊。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then I will ask some questions according to this. First messages. The time was 21st December, 2017 at 9:50 p.m. the message’s from 0958932123. The content was, “I really miss you, my love.” What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這個嘛，她是我的同事。那時候我休了兩天的假，她非常擔心我，所以傳訊息問我發生什麼事。我同事是在美國受的教育，所以她心胸很開放，她講話一直都是這樣子的，至於”my love”，這是我們在叫自己在乎的人、關心的人的方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean your colleague is educated in the US, so her thought was westernized, so the way she talks are more open, and “my love” doesn’t mean anything. Is that correct?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
沒錯。這就只是很好的朋友，互相關心的朋友之間會講的話而已。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
What does the first sentence mean? “I really miss you.”
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，我們是同事，我們是工作搭檔。我請了兩天假，她當然會非常擔心我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們是工作搭檔，就像我說的。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'missed me' as '擔心我' is incorrect. It should be translated as '想念我'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean just because you take two days off, she sent this kind of message to you to tell you without your assistance in the class, she really miss you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using 'miss' instead of 'want'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
沒錯，事情的背景就是這樣子。沒什麼大不了的。

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message. The time was 11:55 p.m., on 29th December, 2017, from the same number. The content was, “I want you by my side, when can we truly get together?” Why do you have this kind of message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'be truly together' as 'truly get together' changes the meaning slightly.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她是在教我要怎麼，她是在教我作業，她在教我這句話該怎麼用中文表達。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
She sends this message to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我妻子剛剛提到的，我正在攻讀碩士學位，我必須要修滿30個學分才能拿到學位，所以，我自然需要做一些作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '修滿' (complete) should come before the object '30個學分' (30 credits).

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you explain what on earth are you learning in your Master degree program?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我在修TESOL學位，這個學位主要是關於英語教學，也包括一些文化及語言能力的課程。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '修' is not an accurate translation for 'program'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '學位' is not an accurate translation for 'TESOL'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that some courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
You mean you are studying for an TESOL Master’s degree, and the program also includes cultural communication?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of TESOL in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of cultural communication in their translation.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
沒錯，我記得至少有三堂課就跟文化溝通有關。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'courses' at the end of the sentence instead of the beginning.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What kind of assignments do these culture and communication program give?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通課程的作業，會針對每一個學生而有不同，像是我的話，我想要在台灣找到一個教英文的工作，所以為了達到這個目標，並加強我的語言能力，我必須顯示我有很好的中文能力。所以我的作業有很多需要翻譯中文句子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這些文化溝通課程的作業會針對每一個學生而有不同'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. The verb '作業' should be pluralized to '作業們' to agree with the plural subject '這些文化溝通課程的作業'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'prove my competence' as '加強我的語言能力' does not accurately convey the meaning. '證明我的能力' would be a more appropriate translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail that the assignments are for the culture and communication courses.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail that the assignments are about Chinese-English sentence translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail that the assignments are for the purpose of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail that the speaker is in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail that the speaker is trying to prove their competence in Chinese.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean since you want to teach English in Taiwan so you need to show that you have good Chinese competence. And so you will have the assignments like translation, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，除此之外我還需要增強我的口說跟寫作的能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s come back to this question. Is this your assignment? The message in your phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我記得我的這個作業，我需要將這個句子翻成英文，但是你也知道，有些中文字對我們來說，是很難詮釋、很難了解的，所以我請我的同事翻譯這個句子，並將答案寄給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The translation does not accurately capture the difficulty of recognizing Chinese characters for foreigners.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You ask your colleague how to translate this sentence to English, so your colleague type this sentence in English and send to you. This message is just the answer of your assignment, correct?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就只是我作業的解答而已。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Page 14 to 16 in file 1. That’s all message contents in your cellphone. Are they all your answers of your assignment?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，這些簡訊全部都是為了完成我的作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Your wife accuse that you have an affair with your colleague. What’s your explanation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我妻子真的想太多了，我知道她一直對我沒辦法穩定地養家這件事情很不滿意，她從我一開始修習這段課程開始，就沒有對我任何的支持。她完全不想協助我得到這個學位，如果她能多支持我一點，我就不用為了完成作業，向我的同事求助，所以她該為這整件事情負責。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我知道她一直對我沒辦法穩定地養家這件事情很不滿意' is incorrect. It should be '我知道她對我一直沒辦法穩定地養家這件事情很不滿意'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '她完全不想協助我得到這個學位' is a mismatched meaning. It should be '她從來沒有願意幫助我完成學位'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '從我一開始修習這段課程開始' which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '如果她能多支持我一點' which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '所以她該為這整件事情負責' which is an important detail in the original text.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, it seems that you two are not getting along with each other, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the sentence.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚的時候，我們相處得很不錯，但是我的工作一直是個問題，我想要在這裡教葡萄牙語維生，但是我的授課時數一直都不穩定，我的工作問題一直成為我們吵架的話題，我的妻子不相信我已經盡力了，而我也沒有辦法讓她了解我所面對的挫折以及困境。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我們相處得很不錯' (We got along well)

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Alright. Let’s go back to your Master degree. When di
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the question about when the Master degree program started and ended.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2015年秋天開始課程，這是一個兩年的課程，所以我原本應該在2017年的5月就可以修習完畢，可是我在這期間也一直有在做兼職的工作，沒有時間完成我的作業，所以我還沒有得到學位。像我剛剛說的，我的妻子完全沒有給我任何支持，讓我覺得我是很孤獨地在攻讀這個學位，我非常的疲憊和挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我在2015年秋天開始課程' is incorrect. It should be '我在2015年秋天開始了課程'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the sentence '所以我原本應該在2017年的5月就可以修習完畢' is incorrect. It should be '所以我原本應該在2017年的5月就可以修習完'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我在這期間也一直有在做兼職的工作' is incorrect. It should be '我在這期間也一直有做兼職的工作'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '所以我還沒有得到學位' is incorrect. It should be '所以我還沒有得到學位'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '像我剛剛說的，我的妻子完全沒有給我任何支持' is incorrect. It should be '像我剛剛說的，我的妻子完全沒有給我任何支持'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You said this is a two-year program, and you didn’t finish it. Why is that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成所有的課程作業。我也沒有達到一些課程的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not being able to finish the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When is your registration of the last semester?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後一個學期是到2017年的春天為止。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'registration' which is an important detail in the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of 'spring 2017' to '到2017年的春天為止', which means 'until spring 2017'. This is a mismatched meaning as it doesn't convey the same information as the original text.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
Like you said, your last semester was until May, 2017. Your messages should have been over after you finished that semester. However, your messages…you two kept sending messages to each other after 7 months…what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the content of the messages.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
即使我的課程已經結束，可是我還想要繼續增進我的語言能力，所以課程結束之後，我還是想要自學。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '即使我的課程已經結束，我還想要繼續增進我的語言能力，所以課程結束之後，我還是想要自學。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean even if you didn’t get a Master’s degree, you still want to keep learning Chinese and want to speak fluent Chinese, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
對，所以我才繼續找我的同事求助。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So this colleague is playing a role of your tutor, correct?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，也是一位真心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我想付費給她的，但是她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想付費給她的，但是她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay for her, why she sends message to you at the time when she should go to bed. It’s not the thing just a coworker would do.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個非常支持我的朋友，她願意犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我才說她是一個非常支持我的朋友'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'using her own time' as '願意犧牲自己的時間' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be translated as '利用她自己的時間'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in this cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
是，我還在那裡工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is this colleague still work there, too?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Is this colleague still working there, too?'

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她也還在那裡工作，可是我們不是工作搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '可是我們不是工作搭檔了' instead of '可是我們不是工作搭檔了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any evidence that want to investigate further or other witness you want to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena this colleague, 黃蓉兒, in 美而美cram school as a witness and ask her about the relationship between she and the defendant and the context and purpose of those messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of subpoenaing 黃蓉兒 as a witness.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the location '美而美cram school' after the witness's name instead of before.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Accuser, do you have any evidence that need the court to investigate further?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that 美而美cram school has taken some actions based on their relationship and even pursue 蓉兒-Huang to quit her job. I want to verify if this is true.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '針對他們兩個人的關係' as 'based on their relationship', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '針對' (targeting or focusing on).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the name '蓉兒-Huang' before the verb 'pursue', resulting in a grammatically incorrect sentence structure.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '補習班' (cram school) in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
Defendant, do you have any evidence that you need the court to investigate for you? According to the situation now, you have already finished your program in May, 2017. You have no reason to send messages with your colleague by the excuse of doing assignment. Furthermore, you send messages to each other after 9 p.m. You need more evidence to help you with this case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master's degree being completed in May 2017.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'need' instead of 'needs' to agree with the subject 'you'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '起人疑竇' as 'you need more evidence', which does not convey the same meaning as 'raise suspicion'.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到其他能請法庭代表我調查的證據，我和我同事之間的對話真的很單純，我只是想要增進我的語言能力，想要把中文學得更好。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我想不到其他能請法庭代表我調查的證據' should be '我想不到能請法庭代表我調查的其他證據'.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next proceeding is set to be at 4:30 p.m. on 24th June, 2018. Both parties should appear in the court. You both can have a lawyer with you. Do both parties understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.
我也明白。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

當然無罪

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure preparation procedure, we will umm examine the details of the Edward’s the defendant’s messages, and try to see whether this constitutes the crime of adultery. Does Do both parties understand… today’s procedure? Have any problem?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Does Do both parties understand… today’s procedure?'

我明白
I understand.

I understand.
我明白

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, the accuser, how long have has your marriage been? Do both of you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject and verb agreement is incorrect in the question.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the accuser's husband.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married four years, and we don’t have any children.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Then, are both of you married in Taiwan? Or in other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
Both of us were met in Taiwan. Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan umm to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Both of us met in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker and their husband met in Taiwan.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation includes the unnecessary word 'umm'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses 'umm' instead of 'to' when indicating the purpose of the husband's visit.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past four years, is his job is to teaching to teach Portuguese? Or, does he have other jobs?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
Umm, at first when we got married, he was still a Portuguese teacher. Umm After we married, he was still teaching Portuguese. Umm However, Portuguese isn’t a very hot uh very… many people want to learn Portuguese…there are not many people want to learn Portuguese, so his teaching hours is not stable, and sometimes he has a period between jobs. Umm After that, he wants to make his income more stable, so he wanted to teach English instead of Portuguese. However, English is not his mother tongue, so he has to he has to seek an advanced degree umm on English.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Umm After we married, he was still teaching Portuguese.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Umm However, Portuguese isn’t a very hot uh very… many people want to learn Portuguese…there are not many people want to learn Portuguese, so his teaching hours is not stable, and sometimes he has a period between jobs.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Umm After that, he wants to make his income more stable, so he wanted to teach English instead of Portuguese.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'However, English is not his mother tongue, so he has to he has to seek an advanced degree umm on English.'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree umm. Does this mean that umm he wants to umm another degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user added unnecessary filler words ('umm') and did not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, I he he wants a degree on English because he wants to teach English and his degree is should… should be about English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California, USA, so he don’t have to go to the school. He can uhh use this terms of learning to learn English. After he finished all the credits, he can get a umm master degree in USA, so he might can find a teaching job in Taiwan.

semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of unnecessary words and fillers in the translation

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then, what’s the relationship between the husband and the person he has an affair with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇對象' as 'the person he has an affair with' instead of 'the person he had an affair with'.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
Umm The woman is his co-worker in the cram school. The cram school will arrange a Chinese teacher and an English teacher uh for English teaching, and umm the woman is partner with my husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How do you know' instead of 'How do you know that'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
Umm At first, I just noticed that he usually work late, and I asked him many times umm why is an English cram school so busy? He answered me that he has to be partner with the Chinese teacher. Umm and they have to prepare for the next class, so they are busy. At first, I didn’t suspect him, and I just found that after he returned to home, he sometimes picked up the phone and even just umm hide hid in the study room, and don’t want me to see it…see this situation. So, I started to suspect he might have an affair with someone else.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
In the cell phone, did you find any umm weird part?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
Umm, I found umm I found umm the same number which frequently appeared in his phone book umm which is really weird, so I just find who the girl is, and I found is Ms. 黃.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '查他的簡訊' as 'find who the girl is' instead of 'check his text messages'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question communicates with the girl via text messages.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the unnecessary detail of the girl's name being 'Ms. Huang'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even it’s just messages, it sounds okay. Umm Is there anything weird? Is there any intimate message in there?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation incorrectly conveys the meaning of the original text by using the term 'intimate message' instead of 'inappropriate content'.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it’s just a normal messages, I would think it’s fine. But my husband is a married man, how could he sent…how could that woman send so intimate messages to him?Umm, I already I already offered some evidence. It should already be in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢' as 'how could that woman send so intimate messages to him?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing evidence to the court in the translation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Umm Just as We will show some evidence about this case. We will display some pic..pictures in the investigatory file page three. Umm is this message in youy cell phone? Is this the message which you sent to the woman?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的, 這些是在我的手機上的簡訊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then, so, then I will I will umm ask some questions according to your messages. Umm on the date of December twenty-one, 2017, at the time twenty-one fifty p.m., there was a messages sent by the number 0958932123. The content was umm I really miss you my baby. Is this sent by the woman?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'my love' as 'my baby' changes the meaning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
恩, 這個是我的同事傳給我的, 我記得那個時候我請了兩天假, 她很擔心我的質狀況所以傳這封簡訊給我, 恩, 我的同事是在美國受教育的, 所以她的思想是開放的, 恩, 這種訊息只是我們關心對方的一種方式, 所以並沒有什麼不妥之處
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So you’re meaning that umm your co-worker studied in foreign country, in US., so she is westernized and open-minded, so “my love” sisn’t mean anything special or intimate. Is that right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of 'my love'

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
恩, 沒有, 這沒有什麼特別的意思, 這只是單純朋友之間的訊息, 或者是你傳給你在意的人的一種很普通的訊息罷了
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

那她前面那句呢？
Then what… what about the previous sentence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the translation of the previous sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛的一樣, 我們是很好的同事, 痾, 我請了兩天假, 她只是很擔心我, 所以才傳了這封訊息給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was away for two days.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'partners' instead of 'colleagues' to describe the relationship.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So, you are meaning that her message is just to express that she reallycared about you, and without your assistant in the cram school, she was hard in the job. Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the person sending the message was hard in the job without the user's assistance.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的, 這就是那封簡訊的內容, 恩這個根本就沒有甚麼大不了的
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in the translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
So, next I will we will talk about the next the second message. It was at the time 11:55 p.m. on the date 2017 December 29th from the same person. Umm, the context is “I want you to by my side, when can we truly be together.”
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	to by should be by
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the word 'to' before 'be'
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	repetition of 'the second' and 'the next'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳…當時她傳這封簡訊只是想要表達恩這句英文..這個中文要怎麼寫, 在我的功課範圍之上
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes unnecessary details and cultural transformation that are not present in the original text.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So, you are saying that the the woman sent you this message just to help you with your assignment? What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我老婆剛剛所告告知法官的, 我當時正在修一個碩士課程, 需要修完30學分, 這個是我必須做的功課之一,
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you please explain what did you learn…what did you learn in your master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
恩我的碩士學位是有關於英語教學的, 只要是關於怎麼教英文, 其他部分還有關於文化還有一些語言能力的部分
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'TESOL' is translated as '碩士學位' which means 'master's degree' instead of 'program'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'English teaching' is translated as '怎麼教英文' which means 'how to teach English' instead of '英語教學'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'some of the courses' is omitted in the translation.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'related to culture and language competence' is omitted in the translation.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So, you are meaning that your master degree is related to TESOL, and in this program also have some courses related to language competence. Is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的, 我至德..記得至少有3門課是和文化還有溝通有關係的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So, what’s your assignment in this kind of culture and communication courses?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這個文化與溝通課程會依每個學生的狀況不同而有所變化,就以我自己為例子, 我想要在台灣尋求教英文的一職, 恩 為了達成我的目標, 並且顯是我的語言能力, 恩所以才會有這樣子的功課, 所以很多我的功課內容都是關於中英翻譯
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, you’re telling me that you want to find a teaching position in Taiwan; umm to reach this goal, the culture courses includes some Chinese translation, and also this translations is part of your assignment. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of completing assignments as part of the course requirements.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'reach this goal'.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的, 恩 我還需要增進自己的會話和寫作的能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
OK, let’s go back to your pre previous sentence. Umm Do you mean that this is your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的, 當我收到個功課的時候, 恩, 你也知道外國人對學中文這件事情是非常難的, 所以我不知道要怎麼翻譯, 我就把這個句子傳給我的同事, 請求她的協助, 希望她能幫我翻譯這句話
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '功課' to translate 'sentence', which is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外國人對學中文這件事情是非常難的' as 'foreigners find it very difficult to learn Chinese', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'how to say them in English' in the translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'You know' in the translation, which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'I needed some help so' in the translation, which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'I asked my colleague to help me' in the translation, which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'and sent me the answer' in the translation, which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'I told her to translate that sentence for me' in the translation, which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '希望她能幫我翻譯這句話' in the translation, which is not present in the original text.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So your meaning is umm because you don’t know the sentence the translation of this sentence, so you sent this message to your co-worker, and asked her to send the Chinese translation back umm. It is just for your assignment only? And didn’t have other special meanings?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是我的作業答案
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Ok, then let’s show some evidences. See the file from the p.14 to p.16, the content of the message. So, all of the messages are only related to your assignment and didn’t have other special meaning?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the question as asking if all the messages were related to the user's assignment and didn't have any special meaning, instead of asking if the user sought help from the other person for their assignment and received the messages as a result.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的, 這些所有的訊息都只是為了完成我的作業
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'purpose' is translated as '目的' instead of '用途', which changes the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then, according to your wife, about you have love affair with your co-worker, what’s your explanation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
恩我覺得我的老婆只是想太多了, 她就是不滿 對於我的工作能力不能滿足, 恩覺得我沒辦法支持這個家庭, 但從一開始, 我學這個碩士課程的時候, 她也沒給我任何的協助, 恩因..因為她不願意幫我, 如果她願意幫我的話, 或是就是幫那麼一點點忙, 我也不用去拜託我的同事, 所以我覺得她就是這件..誤會的罪魁禍首
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我覺得我的老婆只是想太多了'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '不滿 對於我的工作能力不能滿足' is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as '不滿意我對家庭的經濟支持能力'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail of 'she was not willing to help me complete my degree'.

omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the critical context of 'I want the court to know' at the beginning of the text.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
Just as what you mentioned, umm both you and your wife are not getting well with each other?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
恩在我們的婚姻一開始我們確實相處得很好, 而且有很多甜蜜的時光, 但是在這之後, 她對我的就業狀況感到不滿, 我一開始是教葡萄牙文, 但是我的工作時數不穩定, 然後這個就變成我們爭執的原因, 她不相信我曾經為了這件事情努力過而且掙扎過, 然後個就變成我們之間的問題並且會常常為了這事情而爭吵不休
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '恩在我們的婚姻一開始我們確實相處得很好'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Well, let’s go talk about your master degree. When did the master degree begin, and how was it going? Did the master degree end or not?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
恩這個碩士學位是在2015年開始的一個兩年學程, 它應該要在2017年結束, 但是因為我自己個人的打工工作, 所以我最後沒有如期地完成, 就像我剛剛所說的, 我的老婆並沒有就是為我幫我完成這個學位, 痾我覺得我從頭到尾都是孤軍藝人在學這個學位, 這讓我覺得非常地挫折和非常地疲倦
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我自己個人的打工工作' should be '我的個人打工工作'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '我的老婆並沒有就是為我幫我完成這個學位' should be '我的老婆從來沒有支持過我完成這個學位'.

semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of unnecessary content in the sentence: '這讓我覺得非常地挫折和非常地疲倦' should be '這讓我感到非常挫折和疲倦'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So you’re meaning that this should be a 2-year program, but you didn’t finish it, why? What’s the reason for you that you didn’t finish the program?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '你是說' as 'you're meaning' instead of 'you're saying'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'you're meaning' instead of 'you mean', resulting in subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not completing the program.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
恩我沒辦法完成所有的課堂作業, 還有一些課程要求我也無法完成
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
Then, when is your your.. the last.. the final semester that you registered?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我的最後一個註冊學期是在2017年的春
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If what you just mentioned are true, then your courses and your program should be ended in May 2017. You shouldn’t have any assignment of this program. Then why did you have this kind of messages...this kind of assignment with your co-worker even after you end your program for 7 months? What’s your explanation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '課程結束後七個月' as 'even after you end your program for 7 months' instead of 'after the course ended for 7 months'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '你就不會有任何的作業了' which means 'you won't have any assignments'.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然我的我的碩士課程已經結束, 但這不表示我不想再精進我的中文, 就算課程結束, 我還是想練習中文翻譯, 所以我才傳訊息給她
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我的碩士課程已經結束'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about failing the program in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about studying on their own in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about sending a message to someone in their translation.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So, you are telling me that even this program already ended, you still want to polish your Chinese ability. Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的, 這就是為什麼我請我的同事來幫我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, in this whole situation, the co-worker that you mentioned is acted like a tutor of yours…tutor.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'acted' is used instead of 'played' which changes the meaning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅是一位家教, 她對我而言更是我朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
Then did you pay her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有, 我曾經提議要付她錢, 但是她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經提議要付她錢, 但是她拒絕了'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her for money, then why did she send you the messages at midnight? Normal people will sleep at this time. Umm Isn’t this beyond co-worker’s relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這件是為什麼我說她是一個非常幫助我的朋友, 她會犧..使用自己的時間來教我中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她使用自己的時間來教我中文'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '幫助' in the original text means 'supportive' but it is translated as 'help' in the user's translation, which doesn't convey the same level of support.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still teaching in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'English' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的, 我還在那裏工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
So, this co-worker, is she still working in that cram school?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '服務' as 'working' instead of 'still working'

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的, 她仍在那裏教書, 但是我們並不再是拍檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是我們並不再是拍檔了, 她仍在那裏教書'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, so do you still have any evidence or any witness that needs the court to help you subpoena or gather?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
Umm I want the court to help me subpoena the witness, the co-worker, 黃蓉兒, who is working in that cram school,美而美. Umm, I want her to describe the details of the messages and the relationship between her and the defendant.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the witness's testimony, which is to explain the background and purpose of the text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' after the noun 'the court', which is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I want the court to subpoena the witness'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'help' instead of 'subpoena', which changes the meaning of the sentence. 'Help' implies assistance, while 'subpoena' refers to a legal order to appear in court.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '證人身分' as 'co-worker', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'witness'.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the term 'cram school' to the target language, which may not be familiar to non-Chinese speakers. It would be better to translate it as 'tutoring center' or 'private learning institution'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The defendant, do you want any evidence that the court help you to investigate?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the 'informant' in the translation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I have heard that the cram school, 美而美, already took taken some actions on this issues, and tried to persuaded the woman not to do so. Umm can I have more details about this?
semantic conversion	word choice errors	The word 'taken' should be 'take'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'taken' does not agree with the subject 'cram school'. It should be 'has taken'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the specific actions taken by the cram school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you need any evidence that want the court to help you investigate? Umm Now your master degree should ended in May 2017. You have no reasons to send messages with umm that woman. This shouldn’t be an excuse to do so. Moreover, most of your messages were sended at 9 pm, which is very suspicious. Do you need any evidence that want the court to help you investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Umm Now your master degree should ended in May 2017.' It should be 'Umm, your master degree should have ended in May 2017.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'You have no reasons to send messages with umm that woman' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'You have no reason to exchange messages with that woman.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'This shouldn’t be an excuse to do so.' It should be 'This should not be an excuse to do so.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'Moreover, most of your messages were sended at 9 pm, which is very suspicious.' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'Moreover, most of your messages were sent after 9 pm, which is very suspicious.'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我並沒有任何證據需要法官痾法庭幫我查, 恩因為就像我所說的, 我跟我的同事的對話都是非常簡單, 我只是想要精進中文, 並持續練習我的中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我並沒有需要法官或法庭幫我查任何證據'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '我並沒有任何證據需要法官痾法庭幫我查' should be translated as 'I do not have any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the reason for the communication between the user and their colleague was to improve their language ability and continue learning Chinese.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court will set on umm June 24th 2018 at 14:30 p.m. All of the people, including the defendant, the accuser, and the witness should be here. If you need a lawyer, you can apply for a lawyer. Do both parties understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of '庭訂' as 'set on' instead of 'take place'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect placement of 'umm'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of '中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分'

告知權利義務
I’m going to inform the defendant of following obligations and rights

1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
First, you have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

如起訴書所載。
Same as the indictment.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparation procedure for an adultery case. The accuser, 王宇涵, sued his husband, Edward Paparazzi for his relationship with his colleague, which is more intimate than usual. When the accuser checked his husband’s, Edward’s phone message, she found that his husband sends some intimate message with his colleague, and his husband often find an excuse for working late, or going out at midnight, and she found that his husband has an intimate relationship with 黃蓉兒, his colleague, so she sued the case that his husband has some relationship beyond co-worker… and he has an affair beyond co-worker’s relationship with his colleague.The defendant, your wife wants to sue you for adultery, what’s your plea?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	王宇涵 is translated as 王宇涵 instead of the correct translation 王宇涵 (she)

Not guilty, of course.
我當然沒有罪啊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparation procedure, we will ask the both parties some questions to confirm if the defendant really reach the level of adultery and we will check the message detail today to see if the defendant reach the level of adultery. Do the the both parties understand today’s procedure?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'reach' is not appropriate in this context. 'Reach the level of adultery' does not convey the intended meaning.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'the both parties' should be followed by the verb 'understand', not 'understands'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not mention that the purpose of asking questions is to clarify whether there is an extramarital affair between the defendant and their colleague.

我明白
I understand.

I understand.
我明白。

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, the accuser, how long since.. have … since you married to your husband? How many childrens do you have?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Incorrect subject-verb agreement in the question
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'have' in the question
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the plural form of 'child' in the question

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for four years, and we don’t have any children.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'have been married' instead of 'have married'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker is referring to her husband. This detail is important for understanding the context.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Where did you marry? In Taiwan or in other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So…Does your husband teach Portuguese for the past several years? Or is there any other language he taught?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '教葡萄牙文' as 'teach Portuguese', which is correct. However, the user added 'Or is there any other language he taught?' which is not present in the original text.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
He has taught Portuguese for the four past years, and after we got married, he still taught Portuguese. Because Portuguese isn’t an popular language in Taiwan, so he doesn’t have many teaching hours, and he doesn’t have a steady income. So maybe sometimes he will have up to one or two months period between jobs. So to have a steady income, he wants to teach English. But English isn’t his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '剛開始認識的時候' as 'for the four past years', which has a different meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband's teaching hours for Portuguese were unstable and sometimes he had long periods without teaching.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wants to seek an advanced degree, do you mean that he’s looking for a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the person mentioned in the original text wants to pursue a degree in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, I mean that because he wants to teach English, he has to have a degree of TESOL. He found a course on the Internet, and the course is from California, America, and the course provide distant learning program which is distance learning, so he doesn’t have to go to the US and he can enjoy the courses. So after he finished his distance learning program, he can gain a master degree, so he planned to get TESOL and to gain a license to teach English in Taiwan.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '取得的學位是關於英語教學的' as 'a degree of TESOL', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific course being a TESOL program, which is important information in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of the course being a master's degree program, which is a crucial detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the information about the license to teach English in Taiwan, which is an important part of the original text.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what’s the relationship between he and his adultery partner?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'adultery' is not an accurate translation for '外遇'.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
In the courses, there is an English teacher and a Chinese teacher, and they are colleague relationship. That girl is his Chinese teacher in his company. And they are partner relationship.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '補習班的同事' as 'colleague relationship' instead of 'colleague'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '中師' as 'Chinese teacher' instead of 'Chinese teacher in his company'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '外師' as 'English teacher' instead of 'foreign teacher'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '搭檔教學' as 'partner relationship' instead of 'teaching in partnership'.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you that your husband has an affair with his colleague?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At the beginning, I only found that he often worked late in the cram school, but after that, I started to think that it is only a cram school, why do you have to work this late? But he explained that because he is an English teacher, he has a lot to communicate with the Chinese teacher so he have to stay in the cram school to communicate with his colleague. At first, I didn’t suspect him. But after I found that when he got home, he often got some phone calls, and he doesn’t want to pick up the phone in front of me. Instead, he went to his study room to talk in the phone. I wonder why he did this, so later I checked his phone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the speaker is the wife of the person being talked about.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '美語補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'English language school'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the speaker asked her husband multiple times about his late work.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the husband's phone calls are suspicious to the speaker.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the speaker checked her husband's phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything unusual in his cell phone
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
So later I went to check his dial record, and I found that there’s always a same number on his phone, so later I went to check his phone message, and I found that every night he messaged the same woman…every night.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was curious and checked the text messages.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '幾乎每天都通簡訊' as 'every night he messaged the same woman' which is not an accurate translation. '幾乎每天' means 'almost every day' not 'every night'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
It is not that serious if he sent a message to a woman? Or you found some inappropriate message in his cell phone?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea of a message being sent to a woman and questioning if it is inappropriate.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it is only some ordinary messages, it’s ok for me. But he’s married, how can he let a woman send some intimate message to him? Before, I have sent some message to court, they are in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
The displayed evidence one. Here is some message from the phone. The defendant, please check if it is the content of your message.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機裡的簡訊。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then I’ll ask some questions based on the messages. The first message which is sent on nine fifty pm, twenty first December, 2017, from the phone number 0958932123, to your cell phone. The message said, 我真的很想你，what does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這個是我的一個同事傳給我的。那個時候，我請了兩天的假，他非常擔心我，所以他才傳了這封訊息給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，所以他的思想非常開放，他講這些話都很正常，而我很想你，這些都是因為他關心我所以才會說的話，我們都是這樣溝通的。至於My love，我的愛，那只是因為我們很熟，所以我們都這樣稱呼對方。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural references or symbols
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	Adding unnecessary content

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So you mean that because your colleague is educated in the foreign country, so she is westernized, so the message “my love” is because she is open-minded and it doesn’t mean anything, is that right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of 'my love'

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
沒有啊，那沒有什麼意思，那就只是很好很好的朋友之間會互相稱呼的一個名字而已，或者是非常關心對方的朋友也會這樣講。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation misinterprets the cultural context and does not convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness.

那她前面那句呢？
Then what’s the previous sentence in this message?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the previous sentence in the translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我講的一樣，我們兩個是非常好的朋友，而之前我請兩天假的時候，他非常的擔心我，所以他才傳了那些訊息給我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'partners at work' as '非常好的朋友' which means 'very good friends' instead of '合作夥伴' which means 'partners'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '就像我講的一樣' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was away for two days.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So do you mean that because you took two days off, so she didn’t have your help when she is having a class so she missed you a lot, is that your meaning?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對啊，那就是簡訊的內容，我覺得沒有什麼大不了的。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes a cultural transformation by using the phrase '沒有什麼大不了的' which means 'no big deal' in Chinese. This phrase does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
So the second message is sent on eleven fifty-five pm, on twenty nine December 2017, from the same cell phone to your cell phone, and the context is “I want you to by my side, when can we be together?” 我想要你待在我的身邊，什麼時候我們才能在一起呢? Why does the message have this context? And what’s your explanation? Why do you have this message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of 'by my side'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'truly' in the translation
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	incorrect translation of 'truly together'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
當初他傳這封簡訊只是想要教我一句我不會的中文，然後他只是要教我這句話要怎麼講。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that your colleague sent this message to you is to help you to learn Chinese, what does that mean? What do you mean she helped you to do your homework?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the intention of the colleague's message.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太之前有提到的，我現在正在進行一個碩士課程，所以我必須要完成三十個學分才能拿到這個學位，那當然我要完成這個學位我必須完成一些作業還有練習，這就是為什麼。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you please first explain what do you learn in your master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是關於英語教學的。然後這個計畫是教你怎麼去教英文還有一些文化上的問題，所以這其中也包含了語言能力。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of stating that the program was about TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages), the user's translation suggests that the program was about English teaching and cultural issues.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you mean that you’re having TESOL classes in your master degree, and it includes some cultural communication, is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of TESOL classes in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of cultural communication in the translation.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
沒錯，我記得至少有三門課都是有關文化，還有語言溝通的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我記得至少有三門課都是有關文化，還有語言溝通的。'

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So the so-called cultural communication classes, what assignment you have to accomplish in this course?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'kind' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'have' before the subject 'you' in the translation, which is incorrect.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
我的們文化還有溝通作業是因人而異的，每個學生都不一樣，就像拿我自己來說好了，因為我在台灣想要尋找一個英語教學的職位，所以我必須要證明我自己的語言能力，我必須證明我的中文能力是好的。所以我有很多作業都是中英文翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我的們文化還有溝通作業是因人而異的' should be '我們的文化和溝通作業是因人而異的'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '每個學生都不一樣' should be '每個學生都是不一樣的'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: '拿我自己來說好了' should be '以我自己為例'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence: '因為我在台灣想要尋找一個英語教學的職位' should be '因為我在台灣想要找一份英語教師的工作'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of details in the sentence: '我必須要證明我自己的語言能力' should be '我必須證明我具備良好的語言能力'.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of unnecessary content in the sentence: '我必須證明我的中文能力是好的' should be '我必須證明我具備良好的中文能力'.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So do you mean that you want to teach English in Taiwan, so currently you’re studying a master degree to cultivate your Chinese competence…ability? So you have to finish some assignments which is related to Chinese-English translation, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'ability' in the translation

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，所以此外我還必須加強我的會話、口說還有寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我還必須加強我的會話、口說和寫作能力。'

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok so let us be back to the sentence we just mentioned. So is it a part of your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我還記得這些句子。這些句子我必須要把它翻譯成中文，然後，這些中文我必須把它翻譯成英文，而且你知道有的時候這些中文的句子對於外國人來說是非常難理解的，所以我才尋求我的同事幫忙。拜託他幫我翻譯成英文然後拜託他把答案傳給我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not adapt the idiomatic expressions to English.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you mean that you typed a Chinese sentence to her and she sent back the answer which is an English sentence to you, is it the situation at that time? So you mean that it is only your assignment, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就是我作業的答案而已，就這樣。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the message was a text message.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Ok, let us take a look at the displayed evidence, page 14 to 16, these are all contexts of your messages. So in these pages, are the messages all your assignment which is the assignment you asked your colleague for help?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯啊，這些都是幫助我作業的答案。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So according to your wife, your wife just said that you have an affair with your colleague, so what’s your explanation on that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我覺得我的太太真的是想太多了。我知道他一直不滿意我對家庭沒有什麼幫助，但在一開始在我學習中文的時候，他也一樣就是也沒有給我什麼支持。他後來完全不支持我完成這個學位，而且如果他有給我支持的話，我也不會找我的同事幫忙。所以我覺得他應該要對整件事情負責，他不應該誤會我，而且他也沒有給我支持。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, there’s something unhappy between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們婚姻一開始的時候，我們也是有一些美好的時光的，但是問題就是在我的職業。我原本一開始是教葡萄牙文的，但是這並不能給我一個穩定的收入，我不能獲得足夠的教學時數。後來因為工作不穩定，成為了我們兩個常常吵架的原因，我們常常吵架，而我的太太不相信我有盡我最大的努力去找工作或學習英文，然後我也沒有辦法讓他理解我的挫折還有我面臨的困難。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'employment' as '職業' instead of '工作'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect placement of adverb '也'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'from time to time'

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Well let’s get back to the issue of your master degree. When did you start your master degree? And did you finish it? Did you get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我的碩士在2015年的秋季開始的，原本他應該是一個兩年的計畫，預計在2017年的五月結束，但我並沒有完成這個碩士課程，因為我一邊做我的打工，還要一邊上課，我沒有辦法兩邊兼顧。就像我之前說的，我在讀我的碩士學位的時候，我太太並沒有給我支持，我覺得在讀碩士的一路上我都是一個人，所以我開始覺得很累也覺得很挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我的碩士在2015年的秋季開始的'.

semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the detail that the user was working part-time in the sentence '因為我一邊做我的打工'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the detail that the user didn't get enough time to do course assignments in the sentence '還要一邊上課，我沒有辦法兩邊兼顧'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the detail that the user's wife was not supportive in the sentence '我在讀我的碩士學位的時候，我太太並沒有給我支持'.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of unnecessary content in the sentence '我開始覺得很累也覺得很挫折'.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in the sentence '我開始覺得很累也覺得很挫折'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So you just mentioned that it is a two-year program, but in the end you didn’t finish it. Why didn’t you finish it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你最後沒有完成' as 'you didn’t finish it' instead of 'you didn’t complete it', which changes the meaning slightly.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
因為我沒有辦法完成我課程所有作業。還有一些課程的要求我沒辦法達到。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not being able to finish the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So when is your registration of your last semester? When did your register end of your last semester?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the second sentence is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後一個學期的期限是2017年的春季。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '2017年的春季'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So if what you said is true, then your course finished in May 2017, so it is reasonable to say that you won’t have any assignment if your courses are finished. But you and your colleague still have sent message to each other for seven months after your course is finished.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the year of the course ending.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
嗯…我的課程結束了不代表我就不想要精進我的中文，我還想精進我的中文，然後完成一些我自己的作業，所以我才傳那些訊息給我的同事去精進我的作文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我還想精進我的中文，然後完成一些我自己的作業'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about sending messages to colleagues to improve their composition.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So do you mean that you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that what you mean?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是為什麼我要找我的同事幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So you mean that you colleague is playing a role of your home tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'home tutor' instead of 'role model'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是我的家教，他還是我很好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我本來想付她錢的但他拒絕我了。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'declined' should agree with the subject 'she', not 'he'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, then why did she sent messages at the midnight to you, which is the time you should go to bed, and she didn’t say anything and she’s not afraid of tiredness to send messages to you? Is it the relationship beyond co-workers?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我說他是一個非常支持我的朋友。因為他用他自己的時間來幫助我學中文。

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
So do you still teach English in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還是在那邊工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
So does your colleague still works there too?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'works' should be in the present tense to agree with the subject 'colleague'.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，他也在那邊工作，但我們現在已經不是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, is there any other people you want to subpoena? Or any evidence you want to investigate further?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena his colleague, who is 蓉兒黃, working in the cram school named 美而美, I hope she can come to the court as a witness and I want to ask her about the relationship between her and the defendant. And I want to ask about the background of the messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the name of the colleague, 黃蓉兒, and the name of the cram school, 美而美.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school named 美而美 has taken some actions towards the relationship between Edward and 黃蓉兒, and it is about the fact that 黃蓉兒’s leaving her position. I want to ask the cram school if it is true.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'beauty salon'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the actions taken by the cram school are related to the relationship between Edward and 黃蓉兒.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user wants to ask the cram school if the fact about 黃蓉兒 leaving her position is true.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? So the situation now is that your course is finished at May, 2017, so you really don’t have any reason to finish your homework by sending these messages, and most of the messages are sent after nine pm, this is very suspected, so do you have any evidence to prove your situation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'So the situation now is that your course is finished at May, 2017'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'you really don’t have any reason to finish your homework by sending these messages' does not accurately convey the original meaning of '沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'this is very suspected'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'so do you have any evidence to prove your situation?' does not accurately convey the original meaning of '你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我現在想不到法院可以幫我調查的證據，但是就像我講的一樣，我跟我同事之間的關係是非常簡單的，我只是想要精進我的語言能力，然後繼續把中文學好，就這樣子而已。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我現在想不到法院可以幫我調查的證據'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '但是就像我講的一樣' which is important for conveying the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '我只是想要精進我的語言能力，然後繼續把中文學好' which is important for conveying the purpose of the communication.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court is set at four thirty pm, 24 June, 2018, and we will proceed the procedure of questioning the witness. The both parties please come to the court, and you both can have a lawyer, do you understand?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '庭訂' as 'set' instead of 'proceed'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time and date at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'proceed'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the witness in their translation.

 我明白。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The accuser Yu-Hang Wang has prosecuted the defendant Edward Takayashi because the defendant has worked in a cram school, and he has many messages in his phone with another co-worker in that cram school. The defendant sometimes overworks and also have some teleconferencing with the other party. The accuser believes that their relationship has been beyond co-worker’s relationship. Therefore, she has prosecuted this case. The defendant, you wife has suspected you for adultery, what is your plea?

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '所任職之補習班同事' as 'another co-worker in that cram school', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '所任職之補習班同事'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the accusation being for '通姦罪' (adultery crime) in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not include the context of the defendant's wife suspecting him of adultery in the translation.
omission or addition	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate the term '告訴' (prosecute) in the translation.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the term '通姦罪' (adultery crime) to the target language.

Not guilty, of course.
當然是無罪答辯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '無罪答辯，當然是。'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, we will ask the defendant the message he has with the co-worker in order to know whether they had an affair. Do both parties understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我明白
I understand.

I understand.
我了解

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
I would first like to ask the accuser. How long have you been married and is there any children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I have married my husband for 4 years and we do not have any child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I have married'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that they are talking about themselves and their husband.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Where do you and your husband married? Is it in Taiwan or in other country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan four years ago, and he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Over the past years, is his job always teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he is still teaching Portuguese. However, there are not many Taiwanese wanted to learn Portuguese, so his teaching hours is always unstable, there might be a period of one to two months between his jobs. After that, he wanted to have a stable income, so he decided to teach English. However, English is not his native language. Therefore, he is seeking an advanced degree for English.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'After we married, he is still teaching Portuguese.' It should be 'After we married, he was still teaching Portuguese.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	the user omitted the information that the husband's teaching hours for Portuguese were unstable and there were periods of one to two months without any classes.
omission or addition	omitting important details	the user omitted the information that the husband decided to teach English because he wanted a stable income.
omission or addition	omitting important details	the user omitted the information that English is not the husband's native language.
omission or addition	omitting important details	the user omitted the information that the husband is seeking an advanced degree for English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that he was seeking an advanced degree. Does that mean that he is trying to earn a degree in Taiwan?
minor categories of semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the person is trying to earn a degree in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he need a TESOL degree. He has found an online course on the Internet based in California, United States, so he decided to earn his degree from this distance learning course. He believes that in this way, he could finish his credits, and he could earn a US master degree, so he could teach in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific degree (TESOL) that the person needs to obtain in order to teach English in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of the specific online course that the person found in California.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention that the person plans to complete the course through correspondence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the information that the person intends to earn a master's degree after completing all the credits.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention that the person's goal is to find a job as an English teacher in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is his relationship with the person he had an affair with?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word '外遇' (affair) in the translation.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in a cram school, and in their cram school, they will partner an English teacher and a Chinese teacher, and that colleagues is his partner in the cram school.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that your husband has an affair with her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？' as 'How do you know that your husband has an affair with her?' which changes the meaning of the sentence. The original text does not mention the gender of the person the husband is having an affair with.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
Since my husband always work late in cram school, so I ask him “It is just an American cram school. How come you have to overwork?” He told me that he has to collaborate with the Chinese teacher, so he has to stay in the cram school to discuss about their work. At first, I did not suspect him at all. However, he always received phone call, and he will not answer it in front of me. He will go to the study room to answer it, so I decided to check his phone.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Since my husband always work late in cram school' should be 'Since my husband always works late in the cram school'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '美語補習班' as 'American cram school' instead of 'English cram school'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the wife checking her husband's phone because of her suspicions.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything particular in his phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'particular' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is always a same number calling to him. Out of curious, I check his text messages, and I realized they have a lot of text messages every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'phone book' instead of 'text messages'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is communicating with a woman.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Those are just text messages, so it should be okay, or is there anything inappropriate?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the appropriateness of the content

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it is just normal text messages, it should be fine. However, he is a married man, and why would he still text some intimate messages? I have provided some of their intimate messages to the court in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的簡訊' as 'normal text messages' instead of 'just normal text messages'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '已婚的人' as 'married man' instead of 'a married person'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court in the translation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Show file 1 page 13. The defendant, here are some text messages. Are these text messages you have on your phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific file name or location that the assistant should show.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些是在我手機上的簡訊。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'messages' is translated as '簡訊' which means 'text messages' instead of '訊息' which means 'messages'.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I would like to ask the details for these text messages. The first message is sent at 9:50 pm, December 21st 2017, and the phone number is 0958932123 sending to your phone. The content is “I really miss you, my love.” What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated the message correctly, but asked for clarification on its meaning.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
他就只是我的同事而已，我記得我當時請假兩天，他很關心、擔心我，所以他才會傳簡訊來。我的同事是在美國受教的，所以他還蠻開放的。所以他才會那樣說，“my love” 就只是我們關心對方的方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that because the sender stays in a foreign country before, so it means that she is westernized, and when she said “my love” does not mean anything at all?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
是的，這段表達的方式只是我們在乎對方的方式。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the phrase before that?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，他很擔心我。我是他的搭擋，因此他當然很擔心
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'she' as '他' (he) instead of '她' (she).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '很擔心' (worried) before the subject '他' (he), resulting in incorrect word order.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that because you did not go the work for two days, and you could not assist her, so she texted I really miss you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，這就是簡訊內容上面的意思，並沒有什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'message' in the translation.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent on the same phone at 11:55 pm, December 29th 2017. The text message is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this text message mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他之所以傳給我這封簡訊，是告訴我如何用中文表達這句話的意思
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You said that the other party send this message to help you with the assignment. What does that mean
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
我老婆剛剛有提到我正在爭取我的碩士學位，我必須要拿到30學分才能取得學位，所以當然會有一些作業需要完成。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you please first explain about your Master’s Degree?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位主要是有關於英語教學。裡面的課程來講的話，主要就是如何教學英文，以及文化和語言能力相關的課程。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'TESOL' as '我的碩士學位主要是有關於英語教學', which means 'my master's degree is mainly about English teaching', but the original text mentions 'My program was TESOL', indicating that the user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase '裡面的課程來講的話', which should be '來講的話裡面的課程'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'some of the courses' in the original text, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'English teaching' and 'culture and language competence' as separate categories of courses in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that 'some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence', which is a key detail in the original text.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation does not convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness in the phrase '裡面的課程來講的話', which should be translated more formally and politely.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you mean that you are now pursuing TESOL degree, and there are some cross-cultural communication courses?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是，我記得有至少三堂課是和文化溝通有關的。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '課' (lessons) instead of '堂課' (courses).

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What are the assignments for the cultural communication courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'these' before 'cultural communication courses'.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通的課程，作業因人而異。以我自己為例，我現在在台灣教英文，我必須要有好的中文溝通能力。因此，我的作業當中有很多是和中英文翻譯相關。

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that because you have planned to teach English in Taiwan , so you have to prove that you have a good command of Chinese, and you have to practice English-Chinese translation. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的。我也被要求加強我的口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s go back to the text message. Is this one of your assignment
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我還記得那條訊息。你也知道中文對於外國人並不是很簡單，我當時看到中文句子不知道要怎麼翻。因此我才請她幫助我，然後他翻給我這段訊息。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural references

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You have sent her the English message, and she has help you translated. Is that what you mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那條訊息僅僅只是為了我的答案而用而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'answer' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Let’s show file 1 page 14 to 16. These are the content of your text messages. Are these messages your assignment that you have to translated, so you seek for help?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些訊息都是相同的目的，為了完成我的作業而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'purpose' as '目的' is correct, but the meaning of 'completing my assignments' is not accurately conveyed.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What is your explanation on your wife suspecting you having an affair with your colleague?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我太太想太多了，我知道我自己沒有賺很多錢去支撐這個家庭，但在我念碩士學位上，他並沒有給予太多的支持和幫助。我覺得他不願意幫我完成這份學位，如果他能夠多付出一點心力的話，我覺得我就不會去問我同事了，因此他的錯比較大。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'my wife really thinks too much of this matter' as '我太太想太多了', which means 'my wife thinks too much'. The correct translation should be '我太太對這件事情想得太多了', which means 'my wife thinks too much of this matter'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user made a subject-verb agreement error by using '他' (he) instead of '她' (she) in the sentence '我覺得他不願意幫我完成這份學位' (I think he is not willing to help me complete this degree). The correct translation should be '我覺得她不願意幫我完成這份學位' (I think she is not willing to help me complete this degree).

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, you do not get along with your wife, do you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
一開始，我們的確過得很幸福，但是就業一直是個問題。我當時想要教學葡萄牙文，但是我的授課時數一直不穩定。在就業這個議題上一直是個問題，我們在這件事上爭論。他一直認為我並沒有盡力去找到一份好的工作，我也無法向他表達我垂頭喪氣的一面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '他一直認為我並沒有盡力去找到一份好的工作' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他一直認為我沒有盡力去找到一份好的工作'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Now let’s get back to the Master’s degree courses. When did your courses start and end? Have you earned your degree yet?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年的秋天開始上課，這是一個兩年的課程，所以預計會在2017年5月完成。但是因為我有兼職工作，並沒有足夠的時間完成作業，因此還沒有取得學位。就像我說的，我太太並沒有想要幫我的意思，我要自己完成這份學位，我感到疲倦、挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我要自己完成這份學位' (I want to complete this degree by myself). The correct word order should be '我要自己完成這份學位' (I want to complete this degree by myself).

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mentioned that the course is a two-year program, but you did not finish it. Why is that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我無法完成所有的作業以及課程上所設立的標準。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'assignments' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'also' in the wrong position in the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When is the last semester you have registered?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後一個學期註冊是在2017年的春天。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'semester' in their translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'registration' as '註冊' which means 'enrollment' instead of '學期' which means 'semester'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If everything you stated was correct, your semester should end on May 2017, and you will not have any assignment anymore. Why do you still text your colleague 7 months after the semester?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about texting the colleague.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然我沒有完成學位，但並不代表我不想精進我的語文能力。因此我仍繼續和我的同事來往，希望能夠精進我的中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我仍然繼續和我的同事來往'.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You did not finish your degree, but you still want to practice your Chinese to become more fluently. Is that what you mean?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Is that what you mean?'

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，所以我才會請我同事幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
Is your colleague playing the role of a tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不僅是我的家教，也是我的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不僅是我的家教，也是我的朋友。'

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her for tutoring?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
並沒有，我原本想要付錢，但他卻拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我原本想要付錢，但他卻拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you did not pay for her, why did she try to text you in the middle of the night after sleeping hours? The situation is beyond co-workers.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說他是一個很支持我的朋友，他用他自己的時間幫助我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是一個很支持我的朋友'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still working in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'teaching' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還是在那裡工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does this colleague still work in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Does this colleague still work in that cram school?'

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是，他仍在那家補習班，但我們不再繼續搭擋合作了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們不再搭擋合作了' instead of '但我們不再繼續搭擋合作了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Did the prosecutor have any witness to subpoena or any evidence to investigate on?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena the colleague 黃蓉兒from 美而美cram school as a witness in order to explain her relationship with the defendant and the text messages she sent.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Is there anything the accuser would like the court to investigate?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the accuser in their translation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has taken action to their relationship. The cram school has asked 黃蓉兒 to quit her job. I would like to ask whether the court could verify this matter.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'court'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the action taken by the cram school towards their relationship.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the request for 黃蓉兒 to quit her job.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the user's intention to ask the court to verify the matter.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
Did the defendant have anything you want the court to investigate on? The current situation is that your registration for the Master’s Degree has already finished on May 2017, so you should not use finishing assignment for explanation for the text message with黃蓉兒, especially with those messages were texted after 9 pm, so is there anything you want us to investigate on?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Did the defendant have anything you want the court to investigate on?' It should be 'Did the defendant have anything you want the court to investigate?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '希望法庭為你調查的事證' as 'anything you want the court to investigate on'. The correct translation should be 'any evidence you want the court to investigate'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '以做作業為藉口來解釋' as 'use finishing assignment for explanation'. The correct translation should be 'use doing assignments as an excuse to explain'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'especially with those messages were texted after 9 pm'. It should be 'especially with those messages that were texted after 9 pm'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '起人疑竇' as 'so is there anything you want us to investigate on?'. The correct translation should be 'raise suspicions'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'is there anything you want us to investigate on?'. It should be 'is there anything you want us to investigate?'.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我並沒有任何證據能夠證明這件事，但我們的關係真的非常單純，就是我想要學語言，增進我的中文能力。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court's investigation in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '但我們的關係真的非常單純' (but our relationship is really simple) before the main clause, which disrupts the sentence structure.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself' as '我們的關係' (our relationship), which does not accurately convey the intended meaning.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese' as '增進我的中文能力' (improve my Chinese ability), which does not include the mention of learning other languages.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next proceeding of this case will be on 4:30 pm June 24th 2017. We will move on to the cross-examination of the witness. Both the accuser and defendants could hire lawyers if necessary. Do both parties understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.
我也明白。

請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。

如起訴書所載。
The same as the indictment.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The accuser is Yu-Han Wang. She prosecuted his husband, 愛德華•塔喀牙什, for an adultery with his co-worker in the cram school because Yu-Han Wang thinks they are too intimate. She found there are a lot of intimate messages in his husband’s cellphone, and Edward Takayashi usually makes up reasons for overworks and get along with his co-worker. The defendant, your wife thinks you have an adultery with the other, what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'prosecuted' should be in the past tense to match the past tense of the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The name '愛德華•塔喀牙什' is not translated correctly and does not match the original name 'Edward Takayashi'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the reason for the accusation, which is the discovery of intimate messages and the defendant's behavior.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation does not include the fact that the defendant's wife is the accuser in the case.
omission or addition	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user's translation does not include the term 'adultery' or '通姦罪' in the plea.

Not guilty, of course.
我沒罪啊。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, we are going to ask the defendant about the details of messages. And we will decide whether it constitutes adultery or not. And do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我明白
Yes, I do.

I understand.
我了解。

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long have you get married with your husband? Do you have a child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have got married for four years, and we don’t have child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'We have been married for four years.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker is referring to her husband. It should be 'My husband and I have been married for four years.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the couple does not have children. It should be 'We have been married for four years, but we don't have any children.'

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
So, do you get married in Taiwan or overseas?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan four years ago. He came Taiwan, and he wanted to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'He came to Taiwan' instead of 'He came Taiwan'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker's husband came to Taiwan for the purpose of teaching Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, for the past years, is his job always teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met each other at that time, he was a Portuguese teacher. And after we get married, he was still a Portuguese teacher. In Taiwan, there is a few people learning Portuguese. So, his teaching hour was unstable. And there can even be one to two months a period of time between jobs. He wanted a stable job, so he wanted to teach English. However, his mother tongue wasn’t English. So, his sought an advanced degree for that.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'When we met each other at that time'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'And after we get married'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'And after we get married, he was still a Portuguese teacher'
grammar and structure	agreement errors in number or gender	Agreement error in the sentence 'In Taiwan, there is a few people learning Portuguese'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the husband wanted a stable job
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the husband sought an advanced degree
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	Omission of the cultural reference that Portuguese is not widely learned in Taiwan

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
So, you just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree, is that he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan, right?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the cultural context

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get a degree about English teaching. He found a distance learning program on California in United States. It is an on-line learning, and he can get his degree at home. After he completes all the courses, he can get a master degree. Through this, he can find a job about English teaching.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'He found a distance learning program on California in United States.' It should be 'He found a distance learning program in California, United States.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the distance learning program is offered by a university in California.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So, how’s the relationship of he and the person he has affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school. And in that cram school, they tend to partner with a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher. And the person he has affair with is his partner.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '同事' as 'person he has affair with'.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
So, how do you know they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'affair' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
To begin with, my husband usually overworks, and I ask him, it’s just a English cram school, why do you often overwork? And he replied me that because he needed to partner with the Chinese teacher, there was a lot of thing to communicate. At first, I don’t really suspect him. However, he often has some phones after school, and he usually went to the study room to talk. So, I checked the cellphone.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And he replied me that because he needed to partner with the Chinese teacher' should be 'And he replied to me that because he needed to partner with the Chinese teacher'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'overworks' should be 'stays late at work' to accurately convey the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the husband often receives phone calls after work.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the fact that the husband goes to the study room to talk on the phone.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation does not provide the context that the wife checked her husband's cellphone because she started to suspect him.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So, is there anything wrong in his cellphone?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'see' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
After I check his record of phone, I found there was a person usually in his phone book. So, I check his messages afterwards, and I also found there was a woman often messaging him.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'record of phone' instead of 'phone record'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in the phone book and the woman messaging him are the same person.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even the messages, that won’t a big problem, right? Or the content was inappropriate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it a common message, it isn’t a big deal. But my husband was a married man, and how can a woman message him some intimate messages? And I offered some messages for the court in advance, the judge can check that.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '已婚的人' as 'married man' instead of 'husband'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court in advance.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Show the evidence, page 13. The defendant, are these messages on your cellphone, right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages on page 13.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些是我手機裡面的訊息。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I am going to ask you about these messages. The first message was on 12/21 in 2017, the time was 9:50 P.M. And the cellphone number was 0958-932123. And the content was that I really miss you, my love, could you explain what’s that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那是我同事傳給我的，然後我記得那天我已經兩天沒去上班了，所以他才傳給我，關心我一下。我同事是在美國受教育的，所以她非常的開放，然後她之所以會叫我親愛的，那是她表現在乎的人的稱呼方式。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning of the message.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So, do you mean that the person messages you was educated in United States, so her thought was open-minded and westernized. So, she calls you “my love,” it doesn’t mean anything, right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural meaning of the term 'my love' and assumes it has no special significance.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
嗯對啊，那是我們對於親密的朋友會有的稱呼，並沒有什麼特別的意思。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
So, how about the previous sentences?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the translation of the previous sentences.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，我們是同事，然後她非常的關心我，我兩天都沒有去上班，所以她傳個簡訊關心我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我說的，她非常的關心我，我們是同事。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the person was away for two days.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the unnecessary detail of sending a text message.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that you didn’t work for two days, so she didn’t have your assistance, so she really miss you, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the sender misses the user because they didn't work for two days.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對，就像是簡訊上傳的一樣，這根本就沒有什麼大不了的啊。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'no big deal' is translated as '沒有什麼大不了的啊', which means 'nothing serious' or 'nothing important', but it does not capture the intended meaning of 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent on 12/29 in 2017. The time was 11:55 P.M. And it was sent by the same person, the content was that I want you by my side, when can we be truly together. So, could you explain for that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這封簡訊是為了如何幫我用中文敘述我的中文作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她傳這封簡訊給我，告訴我如何在我的作業中表達一個中文句子。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail that the message is about expressing a Chinese sentence in the assignment. The correct translation should include '在我的作業中表達一個中文句子'.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So, you mention that the other party sent the message for you for assisting you to do the Chinese homework. What’s that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
 我老婆剛剛也有提到了，我因為想要找一個英文教師的工作，所以我參加了一個遠距教學的碩士課程，然後在課程裡，我必須完成30個學分，我才可以拿到學位，所以這個作業是在課程裡面所要求的。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user incorrectly translated 'Master's program' as '遠距教學的碩士課程' which means 'distance learning master's course' instead of '碩士課程' which means 'master's program'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about needing to complete assignments and exercises in the program.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
So, could you explain for what do you have to study for your distance learning program for the master degree?

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程主要是英語教學的課程，然後裡面還會包含一些語言能力，還有文化之間的溝通課程。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'TESOL' as '我的課程' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original term.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' before the subject '我的課程', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'some of the courses' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the information about the courses being related to 'English teaching' and 'culture and language competence' in their translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '還有文化之間的溝通課程' which is not present in the original text and is unnecessary.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So, your master degree is about TESOL, right? However, it also contains some culture communication, right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'some' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the word 'culture' in the translation, which is a critical detail in the sentence.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得有三門課是有關文化溝通的課。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我記得有三門課是有關文化溝通的課。'

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So, about the culture communication courses, what’s its homework?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'homework' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
文化溝通課程的作業會是因人而異的，以我來舉例好了，因為我想要在台灣找一個英語教學的工作，所以呢，我的作業就必須對我的中文是很要求的。所以呢，我的作業當中有很多是中英文需要翻譯的東西。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of assignments being different for every student.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of proving competence and seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the need to show a good command of Chinese.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the assignments being about Chinese-English sentence translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of being in Taiwan.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, do you mean that because you wanted to teach English in Taiwan; however, there is a certain Chinese command for you. So, the assignments for culture communication ask you to translate some Chinese and English sentence, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的沒錯，而且我還要精進我的閱讀跟寫作的能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, let’s back to the message. Is this message your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對的，那是我的作業，然後那句句子必須中文翻成英文，你也知道的，外國人學習中文是很辛苦的，因為有些字我們真的認不出來，所以我就請我的同事幫忙，然後請她幫我翻譯成中文再傳送過來。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes unnecessary cultural transformation by using '外國人學習中文是很辛苦的' (foreigners learning Chinese is very difficult) instead of 'some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of asking the colleague to translate a specific sentence.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds unnecessary information about the user's homework and the process of sending the translation.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So, do you mean that you ask for the translation of the Chinese sentence, and your colleague translates it in English? So, the message is just an answer for the assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
是的，那個簡訊只是我功課的解答。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Let’s show the evidence 1, page 14 to 16. Are all these messages just the answers for your assignment?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊都是為了要協助我完成作業的解答。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, what’s your opinion about your wife’s thought, you have affair with your co-worker?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我太太對於這件事真的是想太多了，而且我剛開始攻讀這個遠距教學課程的時候，她就沒有給予我任何支持，然後她還覺得我對這個家庭不用心。她完全不支持我攻讀這個課程，所以我有作業難題的時候也只好去找我的同事，她應該要為這整件誤會負責。

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
So, according to your thought, is there anything unhappy between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們一開始是相處非常愉快的，但是呢，主要就是我工作的問題，因為我想要在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是這個教學時數是非常不固定的，所以我們就有一些爭吵。所以這就變成我們之間最大的問題，她不相信我真的已經盡力去找工作了，所以我們就常常為了這個事情爭吵，然後這讓我非常的挫折，然後我也不知道如何面對她。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我們一開始是相處非常愉快的' (We had a very pleasant time at the beginning). The correct word order should be '我們一開始非常愉快地相處'.

grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以我們就常常為了這個事情爭吵' (So we often argue about this matter). The correct word order should be '所以我們常常為了這個事情爭吵'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我們一開始是相處非常愉快的' (We had a very pleasant time at the beginning) is translated as 'We started off very happily together' which changes the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the speaker trying to teach Portuguese in Taiwan and the unstable teaching hours, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the frustration and difficult situation faced by the speaker, which is mentioned in the original text.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So, let’s go back to your master degree program. When did it begin, and is it over?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2015年開始我的碩士課程的，預計在2017年會拿到學位，但因為我一直有在做兼職，最後學分有點拖延，所以沒有拿到這個學位。就像我所說的，我太太從來不支持我讀這個學位，然後這段期間我遇到學業上的瓶頸的時候也沒人可以支持我，這讓我覺得很累又很挫折。

semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of unnecessary information about the user's wife not being supportive.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in the sentence '這讓我覺得很累又很挫折'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mention that the master degree was a two-year degree, how did you fail to complete?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成所有的學分，還有一些其他課程要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'assignments' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When was your last semester of your registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後註冊的學期是2017年的下學期。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you mention, the last semester registration was in spring in 2017. So, reasonably speaking, there was not any homework after that. However, you have messages with your co-worker after 7 months. Why do you do that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '結束日期' as 'registration' instead of 'end date'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user places the phrase 'after 7 months' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'course ended'.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
即使我沒有拿到那個學位，這不代表我就不想要精進我的語言能力，所以在那之後，我還是一直嘗試著想要精進我的中文能力，所以我就一直靠著自學的方式來進修。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the phrase '在那之後' should be '之後在'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'failed the program' in the translation.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Do you mean that even though you didn’t complete that master degree, you still want to sharpen your Chinese language skill. So, you try your best to learn Chinese, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，所以我找我的同事幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
 So, your co-worker is kind of your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是家教，而且還是我一個非常要好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Do you pay for her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay for her, why does she still message you in the midnight? Is this totally beyond co-worker’s relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我說她是非常有義氣的朋友，然後她甚至不辭辛勞犧牲自己私人時間來幫我學習中文。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'supportive' as '有義氣的' which means 'loyal' or 'honorable' instead of '支持的' which means 'supportive'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'using her own time' which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '然後她甚至不辭辛勞犧牲自己私人時間' which means 'even sacrificing her own personal time' which is not present in the original text.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那邊工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is your colleague still in there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is your colleague still in there?'

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她還有在那邊工作，但我們沒有常常搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們沒有常常搭檔了，她還有在那邊工作。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any evidence or witness and wanted to investigate or subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I wanted to subpoena the co-worker of the defendant, Rong-Er Huang, as a witness. I hope she will be on court to explain the messages and the relationship with the defendant.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important details about the co-worker being employed at the Meimei Tutorial Center and the purpose of explaining the background and purpose of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have any evidence and want the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard about that Mei Er Mei Cram School tried to intervene this event, and they even tried to fire Rong-Er Huang. So, I hope the court ask Mei Er Mei Cram School to verify the situation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '採取行動' as 'intervene this event' instead of 'take action'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '說服...離職' as 'fire Rong-Er Huang' instead of 'convince Rong-Er Huang to resign'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user added the phrase 'I hope' which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase 'ask Mei Er Mei Cram School' which is not present in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence and want the court to investigate for you? Your problem is that your master degree should be over in May in 2017, and you really didn’t have any reasons for messaging with your co-worker, Rong-Er Huang. And most importantly, you usually message each other after 9 P.M. every night, it’s really hard for us not to suspect you. So, do you have anything to help with your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Your problem is that your master degree should be over in May in 2017'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '希望法庭為你調查的事證' as 'evidence and want the court to investigate for you' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'any evidence and want the court to investigate for you'.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '希望法庭為你調查的事證' as 'evidence and want the court to investigate for you' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'any evidence and want the court to investigate for you'.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有進一步的證據可以證明這件事，但是就像我所說的，我跟我同事之間的簡訊真的單純只是為了想要精進我的中文能力而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not having further evidence to support their claim.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court is set on 6/24 in 2018. The time is 4:30 P.M. We will ask questions for the witness. If the both party have necessary assistance, you can have a lawyer.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '中華民國107年6月24日' as '6/24 in 2018'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time '4:30 P.M.' before the date '6/24', which is the incorrect word order.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the need for both parties to attend the court.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of an adultery case. The accuser Yu-Han Wang filed this case because his husband Edward Takayashi had a relationship beyond co-workers with a woman in the cram school he works in. There were intimate messages between the two of them and the defendant had made up reasons for working long nights. He also tele-conferenced with Rong-Er Huang at midnight. The accuser believed they have a relationship beyond co-workers. The defendant, your wife has accused you of adultery. What’s your plea?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	his husband Edward Takayashi had a relationship beyond co-workers with a woman in the cram school he works in.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The accuser Yu-Han Wang filed this case because his husband Edward Takayashi had a relationship beyond co-workers with a woman in the cram school he works in.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The defendant, your wife has accused you of adultery. What’s your plea?

Not guilty, of course.
當然無罪
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, we will ask both parties the details of the case to confirm whether the defendant and his colleague constituted adultery. Do both parties understand?

我明白

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long have you married your husband? Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should be changed to 'been married' to match the present perfect tense.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question does not include the information about having children.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I was married to him four years ago and we don’t have any kids.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is a woman.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the past tense 'was married' instead of the present perfect tense 'have been married' to indicate a continuing state.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
When did your marriage take place? Was it in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan four years ago. He came to Taiwan because he wants to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'want' should be in the past tense to match the time frame of 'four years ago'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past few years, his job was to teach Portuguese?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '教葡萄牙文' as 'to teach Portuguese', which is a mismatched meaning.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still teaches Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan. His teaching hours can be very low sometimes. Like..the period between jobs is like one to two month. In order to have a stable income, he decided to switch to teaching English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Like.. the period between jobs is like one to two month.' The correct word order should be 'Like.. the period between jobs is like one to two months.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband wanted to seek an advanced degree in English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree, does it mean that he want to have a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the person wants to have a degree in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to get a degree on English-teaching. He found a distance learning program online from California so he can have distance learning instead of taking course in the USA. After he finishes all his courses, he can get a master degree. Therefore, he is able to get a job in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to get a degree on English-teaching'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the distance learning program is from a university in California
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the information that the program is for teaching English
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention that the program is a master's degree program
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the information that the program is completed through correspondence

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is his relationship with the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They were colleagues at the same working place. The cram school will partner an English teacher with a Chinese teacher. They were partners.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '補習班' as 'working place' instead of 'cram school'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the female person mentioned is the Chinese teacher in the class.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you assume that they have adultery?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text, assuming that the speaker is talking about adultery.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I noticed my husband will often stay at the cram school for long hours. I asked him several times. It was merely an English cram school, why did he need to work for such long hours. He told me he partnered with a Chines teacher and there was a lot to communicate with on teaching programs. I had no doubt with him in the beginning. However, when I found out that he got a lot of calls after he got back home and he would hide to the study room to answer them. So I decided to check his cellphone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the suspicion and directly jumped to checking the husband's cellphone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything suspicious on his phone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '不尋常的' as 'suspicious' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there was a number he often called and answered. So I was curious and I checked his messages and I found out he had been texting this girl for a long time.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the person in question was texting the same number frequently.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'checked' before the object 'his messages', which is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question was calling and answering the number frequently.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even if they text each other, it was merely messages. Or is there any inappropriate messages?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the question of whether there are inappropriate messages.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
He is a married man. Why did the woman text him intimate messages? I have provided files to the court previously. The evidence should be in the files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '讓對方發一些很親密的字句' as 'the woman text him intimate messages'. The original text does not mention the woman sending the messages, but rather questions why the man allowed the woman to send intimate messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing files to the court and the evidence being in the files.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Check and confirm the evidence used in the case. Investigatory record p.13, are these the messages you sent, defendant?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機上的簡訊內容。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I am going to ask you some questions based on these messages. The first message was sent on December 12th ,2018 at 9:50 pm. It was sent by the number 0958-932123. The content is「I really miss you, my love」. What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封簡訊是我同事傳來的，我記得那時候請了兩天假，她有點擔心我，所以才傳的。我同事在美國受教育所以她思想比較開放，至於我的愛呢，那只是我們對在乎的人的稱呼。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that because your colleague is educated in the US before so she is westernized and has an open mind so my love does not mean anything special?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿，那只是對在乎的人一個常用的稱呼而已。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the “I miss you” part?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about 'I miss you'.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛說的，那時候我請了兩天的假，她自然就打出了那些字阿。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean the reason she sent the message is because at then you took two days off and without your assistance she missed you a lot.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是阿，內容大致如此，那簡訊沒什麼大不了的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent on December 29th , 2018 at 11:55pm, and it was sent by the same number, the content was “ I want you by my side, when can we be truly together? ” what does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這封訊息來教我怎麼正確表達在我作業上的中文句子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
She sent the message because she wanted to help you in the assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太告知法院的，要完成碩士學位，我必須修滿三十學分，所以我自然有一些功課要做。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '修滿' should come before the object '三十學分'.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you please explain what the program of your master degree is?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是有關英語教學的，除了教學以外還有些課程和文化跟語言能力有關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'some courses' in the original text.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'TESOL' as a program related to English teaching.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So your master degree was about TESOL and there are some cultural communication programs?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of cultural communication courses in their translation.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少有三堂有關文化溝溝通的課程
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What is your homework in those courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'homework' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這樣的課程會給學生們不同的作業，像我在台灣是要找一個英文教學的工作，為了達到這個目標，我需要證明我中文很好。所以我的作業裡面有很多關於中翻英的句子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So because you plan to teach English in Taiwan, the homework is to somewhat prove your Chinese ability by giving you assignments on translating sentences?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，同時我也被要求要精進我的口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Back to what we mentioned, this is your homework right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Is this your homework?'

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我記得那句。當我看到那些中文句子，我不知道怎麼翻譯成英文，中文字對外國人來說有時候很難理解，所以我就向她尋求幫助，然後再叫她回傳答案給我。

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you mean you told your colleague the Chinese version of the sentence and she sent it back the English version by messages and it is merely the answer to the homework?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是我作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
So back to investigatory file one page 14 to 16, please take a look at those messages. Are they all sent by this colleague because she wanted to help you on your assignment?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的這些簡訊都只是用來解答我的作業而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So what is your explanation about your wife accusing you having an affair with your colleague?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我太太在這事上太小題大作了。我知道她對我並不滿意。從一開始我去修學位時她就沒有給予我任何支持了。如果她能夠表現出一點支持，我就不用向我同事尋求協助了。我認為她應該為這次的誤會負責。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'thinks too much of this matter' as '在這事上太小題大作了', which means 'making a big deal out of this matter', but the original text implies that the wife has high expectations or a high opinion of the matter, not that she is overreacting.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'supporting the family' as '對我並不滿意', which means 'not satisfied with me', but the original text refers to the husband's ability to financially support the family.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'supportive' as '給予我任何支持了', which means 'did not give me any support', but the original text implies that the wife did not show any support, not that she did not give any support.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'help me complete my degree' as '尋求協助了', which means 'sought help', but the original text implies that the husband asked his colleague to help him, not that he sought help from his colleague.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'blamed' as '負責', which means 'responsible', but the original text implies that the husband thinks the wife should be held accountable or blamed for the misunderstanding.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statements, are there any unhappy events between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
結婚一開始，我們的確相處的不錯，後來她就對我教葡萄牙語這件事非常不快，因為我拿不到穩定的授課時數。我的工作就變成我們之間最主要的問題。我沒辦法讓她明白我的挫折和困難。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'good time' as '相處的不錯', which means 'getting along well', but the original text refers to 'some good time' which implies enjoyable moments or experiences.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '後來她就對我教葡萄牙語這件事非常不快' before '結婚一開始', which changes the chronological order of events.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the user's employment as the main issue between the couple.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of the couple fighting over the employment issue.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the frustration and difficult situation faced by the user.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the user's efforts to try their best.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the user's inability to make the spouse understand their frustration and difficult situation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the spouse's lack of belief in the user's efforts.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the fact that the couple fought from time to time over the employment issue.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the user's attempt to teach Portuguese in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the user's inability to secure stable teaching hours.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So back to your master degree, when did you start the degree and when did it end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這個課程在2015年的秋季開課的。這是個兩年的學程。照理來說我在2017年的五月就該畢業了。可是因為我做兼職的工作，所以我沒辦法好好完成我的那些作業。就像我說的，我太太並沒有很支持我。在我看來，我是獨自完成這個學位而沒有靠她的任何幫忙。我覺得很累也很挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '這是個兩年的學程' should be '這是一個兩年的學程'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense in the sentence '照理來說我在2017年的五月就該畢業了' should be '照理來說我在2017年的五月就應該畢業了'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program, which is 'because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated, which is 'I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for lack of support from the wife, which is 'my wife has never been very supportive'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated, which is 'I became too tired and too frustrated'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated, which is 'I became too tired and too frustrated'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated, which is 'I became too tired and too frustrated'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
The program was to study for two years, but you did not. Why?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成課堂上的所有作業。還有一些課堂上的要求
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not being able to finish the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
What is the last semester you registered in?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後一學期是2017的春季班。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '2017的春季班是我註冊的最後一學期。'

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said the last semester of your registration was in May 2017, but the messages continued seven months later after you should have finished your degree. And why is that?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the registration period and the degree being pursued.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
儘管我沒有完成我的學位，這也不代表我不想精進我的語言能力，在課程結束後我還是有繼續精進我的中文能力。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of studying on their own after failing the program.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Just like you said, you wanted to keep learning Chinese despite you failed to finish your degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的。這就是我向我同事尋求協助的原因。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague’s role is to be your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅是我的家教更是我真心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有。我原本要給她錢但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我原本要給她錢但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she still text you at midnight? It is way beyond a colleague’s duty.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我說她是非常支持我的。她用她私人時間來幫我回答問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她用她的私人時間來幫我回答問題。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still working at the cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'teaching' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那工作

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
And does this colleague still work there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她還在那邊工作但我們不在是搭檔關係了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們不再是搭檔關係了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Does the prosecutor wish to subpoena any witness or investigate any ecidence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope the court to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, Rong-Er Huang, to explain the reasons and the background of those messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the crucial information that the colleague is a witness and should testify in court.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had took some actions. They have persuaded Rong-Er Huang to leave the job because of her relationship with my husband. I want the cram school to clarify the statement.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'beauty salon'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'had' before the subject 'the cram school', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the relationship between the husband and Rong-Er Huang, which is crucial for understanding the context.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the request for clarification from the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate for you? Your lesson should be finished in May 2017. You shouldn’t make up reasons for texting her seven months later. And your messages were all sent in midnights. Do you have any evidence to help you explain the situation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Your lesson should be finished in May 2017.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你的碩士學位' as 'Your lesson' instead of 'Your master's degree'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the present tense 'should be finished' instead of the past tense 'had already ended'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's interaction with '黃蓉兒' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the time of the defendant's interaction with '黃蓉兒' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's interaction with '黃蓉兒' being suspicious in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant needing evidence to help his case in the translation.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有什麼證據好提供的。就像我說的，我和我同事之間的關係很簡單。我就是想要精進我的語言能力然後她幫助我。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court's investigation and the purpose of the communication.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb phrase '然後她幫助我' (and then she helps me) at the end of the sentence instead of after '我就是想要精進我的語言能力' (I just want to improve my language ability).

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next proceeding will be on June 24th ,2018 at 4:30 pm. The accuser and the defendant, please be here on time. Both parties can hire a lawyer if necessary.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the witness examination procedure.

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.
我也明白。

Same with the indictment.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case and the incident is that the defendant has an affair with the cram school teacher and they often message through the phone and has a telephone-conferencing at midnight and the message is too intimate and the defendant often finds reasons to work too late and he often has an telephone-conferencing with黃蓉兒and this is beyond coworkers’  relationship, so we prosecute the defendant.The defendant, your wife accused you for having an affair with other women. What’s your plea?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '告訴人' as 'defendant' instead of 'plaintiff'.

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'am' is missing in the translation.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, we mainly try to understand the detail of the adultery case and do both parties understand today’s procedure?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the specific purpose of the procedure, which is to inquire about the communication details between the defendant and their colleague to determine if there is an extramarital affair.

我明白

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
I want to ask the accuser first. How long have you been married? How many kids do you have?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I have been married with my husband for four years and we don’t have any kids.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Then, where did you get married? In Taiwan or in foreign countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
My husband and I met in Taiwan and he came to Taiwan in order to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past four years, did your husband teach Portuguese all the way?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met with each other, he was an Portuguese teacher and he continued to teach Portuguese.However, the learning people of Portuguese in Taiwan is not too much and teaching hours is not stable and the job always has a period between jobs.Because the income is not stable, so my husband decided to learn mother tongue and seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'When we met with each other' should be 'When we met each other'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'the learning people of Portuguese' should be 'the people learning Portuguese'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'the job always has a period between jobs' should be 'the job always has periods of unemployment'.
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	Article error in the sentence: 'the learning people of Portuguese' should be 'people learning Portuguese'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in the sentence: 'he decided to learn mother tongue and seek an advanced degree' should be 'he decided to learn English and seek an advanced degree in it'.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that your husband are seeking an advanced degree and does that mean he wants to get a degree in Taiwan?
minor categories of semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seeking an advanced degree' instead of 'taking further studies'.
minor categories of cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterpreted the cultural reference of '進修' and assumed it meant 'seeking an advanced degree' in the target language.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because my husband want to teach English in Taiwan, so he want to get a degree about English teaching. He searched for a distant learning program from California in America. He just go for a course of distant learning and meets the qualification that he could get a degree.In this way, he can get a master degree of English learning and after he gets the certificate, then he can teach English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'He just go for a course of distant learning'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence 'and after he gets the certificate'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the distant learning program is from a university in California
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the degree is a master's degree
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the degree is specifically in English teaching
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the degree is obtained through completing all the required credits
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the distant learning program allows him to study without going to the United States
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the distant learning program is completed through correspondence
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the goal of getting the degree is to find a job as an English teacher in Taiwan

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
 So, what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
Then, his cram school proposed a case about the combination of Chinese and English teaching and my husband partnered with the Chinese teacher.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the female teacher in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'my husband' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'partnered with the Chinese teacher'.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How do you know' instead of 'How do you know they'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
 My husband always stayed in the cram school for the reasons of the too much working load but I don’t think that the loading is too heavy. They said that they had to communicate with the partner about the teaching course. At first, I didn’t have any suspection for my husband but I observed that after he came back, he always has a phone call and didn’t talk about the content of the phone call and always got to the study room to have a phone call, so I started to suspect of my husband.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing information
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the context

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So, in the cell phone, do you find something weird?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I found in his phone book they are too many the same number, so I started to check his message and found that they have a lot of messages with each other.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'phone book' instead of 'message records'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is communicating with a woman.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even though they just message to each other, I think it is not too strange. It’s still OK.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks if the content of the message is inappropriate, while the user's translation states that it is not too strange and still okay.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
I think if they don’t have nothing, why did they often send intimate messages to each other and use the intimate words and phrases. He has been married and why did he do that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error ('if they don't have nothing').
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user providing the text messages to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
The defendant, please look at the indictment 1 page 13. There are some messages. Do you send these intimate messages?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些親密訊息都是在我手機上。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'these were the messages' as '這些親密訊息' which means 'intimate messages' instead of '這些訊息' which means 'these messages'.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I’ m going to ask you some questions based on these intimate messages.The first message happened at 106/12/21 9:50 p.m. and the phone number is 0958-932123 and the message content is “I really miss you, my love.”
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那是我其中一個同事發給我的簡訊。因為我前兩天都加班到很晚，所以她關心我的狀況。我同事是受過美式教育的，所以她是非常的劍潭與開放。那至於這個my love，只是我們之間的一個稱謂而已，其實沒有什麼。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	劍潭 instead of 開放
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	簡訊 instead of 訊息
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of taking two days off from work
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of colleague being concerned or worried
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of colleague being educated in the US
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of colleague being open-minded
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of 'my love' being a term of endearment

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So, do you mean that because your colleague once studied in aboard and her thought is westernized, so the express of the emotion is very open. The phrase ”my love” means nothing, right?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿!那個my love 就只是我們對彼此的稱呼，其實也沒有什麼，就是西方稱呼彼此都是這樣。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the idiomatic expression 'my love' to the target language.
cultural transformation	ignoring cultural taboos or sensitivities	The user did not consider the cultural sensitivity of using the term 'my love' in the target language.

那她前面那句呢？
Then, what’s your explanation about the previous sentence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the previous sentence in their translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，她只是單純擔心我而已。因為我們是同事，工作壓力比較大，她當然會關心我啊!
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為我們是同事，工作壓力比較大，她當然會關心我啊!'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the person was worried about the speaker, but the user's translation says that she is just concerned because they are colleagues and have work pressure.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So, do you mean that because you have not gone to work for two days and don’t assist with your course, so she sent the message to concern you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using 'concern' instead of 'miss'.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，那就是訊息的內容阿!沒有什麼其他的。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes the phrase '阿' which is a cultural marker in Chinese but does not have an equivalent in the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Ok, and the second message was sent at 11:55 p.m. 106/12/29 from the same person and the message was that “I want you by my side, when do we get together?”
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'truly together' as 'get together', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'do' before 'we' instead of after 'when', resulting in incorrect word order.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她只是傳這封簡訊來向我詢問說這個句子的意思與表達。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment,' the user's translation says 'She just sent this text message to ask me what the meaning and expression of this sentence are.'

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So, do you mean that your colleague sent a message to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太之前說的，我曾經修習英語教學的碩士學位，要30學分才能畢業，常常需要完成一些作業和練習，她只是幫我罷了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經修習英語教學的碩士學位，要30學分才能畢業，常常需要完成一些作業和練習，她只是幫我罷了。'

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
What do you study in your master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是關於英語教學的，那主要是學習英語教學，還有學習語言文化相關，還有語言能力。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '碩士學位' is translated as 'program' instead of 'degree'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '學習英語教學' is translated as 'learning English teaching' instead of 'learning about English teaching'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase '還有學習語言文化相關' is translated as 'and others were related to culture and language competence' instead of 'and others were related to culture and language'.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The phrase '還有語言能力' is translated as 'and language competence' which is not present in the original text.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So, do you mean that you get a master degree of English teaching and the course is combined with some culture communication?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得有三門關於文化溝通的。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So, what kind of assignment do the culture communication courses often assign?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這個跨文化溝通的課程其實是非常的不一樣的。像我就是要尋找一個英語教學的職位，那我必須要對於中文有非常好的造詣。因此，我的作業很多都是關於英中翻譯的。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting the purpose of the assignments and transforming it into a general statement about cross-cultural communication courses.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '像我就是要尋找一個英語教學的職位'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omitting the mention of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher in the user's translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omitting the mention of proving competence in Chinese in the user's translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, do you mean that because you want to teach Chinese in Taiwan, so you have to finish the English courses about culture communication and the assignment is always about English-Chinese translation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，我也必須要常常精進我的寫作與口說能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s get back to the sentence…
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific sentence they were referring to.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對的，因為我對於中文其實沒有很了解，所以我就傳了中文句子給我同事，請她幫我翻譯，然後她把中文翻好之後再用英文傳過來。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was mentioned in the original text.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So, do you mean that the assignment you sent some Chinese sentence to your colleague and your colleague sent back the English translation? In other words, is that the answer of the translation?

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那個簡訊就是那個中文句子的翻譯解答。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
The defendant, please look at the indictment 1 page 14-16 and please quickly browse these messages and I want to ask you that are these messages is all about the assignment?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking help from the other person in the messages.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊的傳送都是為了幫助我完成作業?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'the same purpose' as '幫助我完成作業' which means 'help me complete my assignments', but the original text refers to the purpose of completing assignments, not the act of completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, your wife accused you for the adultery and what’s your explanation about this?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
關於這件事，我覺得我老婆想太多了。她認為我沒有能力支持家庭，而且她在我學習的時候，我老婆也從來沒有對我有任何幫助阿。因為在我就讀碩士時候，其實她沒有給我什麼幫助。那假設她能給予我幫助的話，就是不用傳那麼多訊息去尋求幫助了，所以我覺得她應該被這件事被譴責。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'blamed' as '被譴責'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the wife's lack of support in the original text

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to the sentence from both parties, I think that your married life is not too good.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們感情的初期，其實是過的有點苦，特別是在我尋求葡萄牙文的工作時候，因為當時後收入不是很穩定。因此，我老婆對於我工作不穩定其實不諒解，我們常常因為此事而吵架。我老婆甚至沒有體諒我所遇到的挫折及遇到的困難。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '在我們感情的初期，其實是過的有點苦' should be '其實在我們感情的初期，是過的有點苦'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '過的有點苦' is translated as 'a little bitter' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'some good time' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the problem is related to the speaker's employment.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the speaker tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the speaker's job became an issue between the couple.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the couple fought from time to time over the employment issue.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not convey the speaker's frustration and difficult situation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the speaker's attempt to make the wife understand his situation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention the wife's lack of belief in the speaker's efforts.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
OK, let’s get back to the master degree. When did you start your master degree and when did you finish? Did you get a degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這個碩士學位是從2015年的四月開始。原本預計是2017年五月會取得學位，但是因為其實在過程中很少有時間去認真完成作業，所以最後還是還沒有得到學位。就像我說的，我的太太在我的求學過程中，其實沒有給我任何幫助，所以我一直都是孤單一個人去追尋我的夢想，努力取得學位，所以我非常的疲累與挫折。
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of the specific month when the program started
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect placement of the month and year in the sentence
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the cultural significance of the fall semester

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So, do you mean that your master is long for two years and you didn’t finish, why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the original text and translated it as 'master' instead of 'course'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'is long' instead of 'was supposed to be'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for not completing the course.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
因為我沒辦法完成所有的作業，而且還有一些課程上的要求也沒有達成。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'couldn't' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'also' in the wrong position in the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
Then, what's the date of the last registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
上一次最後註冊日期是2107年...
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated 'spring 2017' as '2107年' instead of '2017年'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, the courses ended at in 2017/05 and the learning should not be continued to July, then why do you still send the messages in July?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '課程結束後七個月' as 'July' instead of 'seven months after the course ended'.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然碩士學位已經結束了，但是我還是非常積極的學中文，所以在那之後，我還是持續的學習中文，而且也非常努力的研讀。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我還是非常積極地學中文'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb '學習' should be past tense to match the context of the sentence. It should be '我還是持續地學習中文'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the studying was done 'on my own'. This detail is important to convey the meaning accurately.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So, do you mean that after the program, you still want to learn Chinese, so you study very hard alone, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這也就是為什麼我會尋求同事的幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, in other words, your colleague played the role like your tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
對我來說，她不只是一位家教，也是一位很好的朋友?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
Then, do you pay to her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
並沒有，其實我有想要給她錢，但是她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我並沒有' instead of '並沒有我'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn't pay to her, why did she still passionate to send these messages? Isn't it clear?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misunderstanding the original text

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以就是我說因為她非常支持我，所以她願意花自己的時間來教我啊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以她願意花自己的時間來教我' instead of '所以就是我說因為她非常支持我，所以她願意花自己的時間來教我啊。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
So, does the colleague still work there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，她還在那邊工作，但是我們已經沒有任何課程方面的合作了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是我們已經沒有任何合作了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any further to add or search for more information?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
My honor, I want to ask the colleague of the defendant, also黃蓉兒from美而美 cram school and talks about the purpose of the messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the part about explaining the relationship between the witness and the defendant.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention the background of the message writing.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have something needs our assistance to investigat
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'any' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
 I have heard the美而美cram school once took action about the two person, so I want to ask about the evidence form the cram school.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '美而美' as '美而美cram school' instead of 'Mei Er Mei tutoring center'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the action taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user added the phrase 'so I want to ask about the evidence form the cram school' which is not present in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want us to investigate?The defendant, since the master degree ended at 2017/05 but after that, you and黃蓉兒still have many interaciton and even after 9 p.m., you and黃蓉兒still send messages, so do you have any evidence want to search about this?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The defendant, since the master degree ended at 2017/05 but after that, you and黃蓉兒still have many interaciton and even after 9 p.m., you and黃蓉兒still send messages, so do you have any evidence want to search about this?'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
關於這件事，其實我沒有什麼證據能夠提供的。就像我說的，我只是單純因為修習英語教學碩士學位的文化溝通的課程，我只是想要改進我的英文能力。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '修習英語教學碩士學位' (pursuing a master's degree in English teaching) at the beginning of the sentence, which disrupts the natural word order in Chinese.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '改進我的英文能力' (improve my English ability) as 'improve my language ability,' which is a mismatched meaning.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next procedure is at 2:30 p.m., 2017/06/24 and please the defendant and the accuser come to the court. Both parties can hire a lawyer.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '證人詰問程序' as 'procedure' instead of 'witness questioning procedure'.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for love affair. Yu-han Wang filed the suit because her husband with his colleagues has some imitate messages with each other, and her husband often has some regular contact with his colleague Ron-er Huang. The defendant, your wife is going to suit you, and what’s your plea?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	love affair instead of adultery
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	preparatory procedure for love affair instead of preparatory procedure for adultery
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	has some imitate messages instead of has some intimate messages
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	his colleague Ron-er Huang instead of her colleague Ron-er Huang

omission or addition	leaving out critical context	left out the context of the lawsuit being about adultery

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯，當然。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, we are going to see the details of the messages and to decide whether the detail is enough to make the case. Do both parties understand the procedure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long you married with your husband? Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should be in the present perfect tense to match the question structure.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question does not include the information about having children.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve married for 4 years. We have no children.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Did you marry in Taiwan, or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met with my husband in Taiwan, and he came to Taiwan here because he taught Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So he taught the language is always?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
After our marriage, he kept teaching language as a language teacher. He keeps teaching. But the language is not frequent in Taiwan, so he had no steady class. Often there’s one or two months no class for him. In order to make income steady, he decided to teach English, but English is actually not his mother tongue, so he decided to go to English class.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of 'language' instead of specifying 'Portuguese'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'Portuguese' before 'language teacher'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'Portuguese' before 'language' in 'he keeps teaching'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'Portuguese' before 'language' in 'the language is not frequent in Taiwan'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'Portuguese' before 'language' in 'one or two months no class for him'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'Portuguese' before 'language' in 'he decided to teach English'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'Portuguese' before 'language' in 'English is actually not his mother tongue'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mean the course, does it mean the degree?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the word 'course' as 'degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wants to teach in Taiwan, so the degree he wants to get is about teaching English. The file for the America California is far distance course that allowed him to have the course from the far distance. After he gets the credit, he will get the master degree. And after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between him and this love affair object.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in a cram school. The cram school has Chinese teacher and English teacher at the same class, and the one in this love affair is the Chinese teacher in the class.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '同事' as 'love affair' instead of 'colleagues'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'in this love affair' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'Chinese teacher'.
cultural transformation	omitting or misrepresenting culturally specific concepts	The user did not accurately convey the concept of a 'cram school' in the translation.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have love affairs?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'love affairs' instead of 'cheating'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At the first I discover my husband stayed in the school for a long time. I wonder that is only an English cram school, why did he have to stay there for long, and he answered he had to communicate with Chinese teacher. At first I didn’t doubt him, but I found there are some phone calls to home and he always answered when I wasn’t there and he even answered phone at the study.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'At the first I discover my husband stayed in the school for a long time.' It should be 'At first, I discovered that my husband stayed in the school for a long time.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the reason for the husband's long hours at the school, which is to communicate with the Chinese teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the fact that the husband receives phone calls after coming home and answers them in a separate room.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
When you checked the phone, did you find anything strange?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '不尋常的' as 'strange' instead of 'unusual'.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I found a regular number in his phone, so I checked the email and I found there are many emails about the colleagues that almost contact each other every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '電話號碼' as 'email' instead of 'phone number'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the person being contacted, which is a critical detail in the original text.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
It seems common for the message, is that strange in the content in the message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If this is only a common message, that’s OK. But there are often some strange words and imitate words in the message. I have filed it to the court, that should be in the file there
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
The exhibit 13, there is the content of the message. The defendant, is it from your message?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機的簡訊。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I am going to request you from these messages. The first message is at 21:50 on 21st December, 2017. The number is 0958-932123. The content is “I really miss you, my love”, and what does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封信是我同事傳給我的，我記得那時候我請了兩天假，她很擔心我，所以才傳了這封簡訊來。我的同事是接受美國教育，心胸非常開闊，那只不過是她講話的一種方式來表述自己想要表達的。「my love」只不過是一個我們對於一個在乎人所用的用法。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural expression

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
The messenger is from the US and her way to speak is so open, so ‘my love’ means nothing, is it right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural meaning of 'my love' in the context.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對啊，那根本就沒有代表什麼，它只不過就是互相表達關心的詞而已。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the former sentence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'former' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
正如我前面所說的，我沒去上班的兩天，她很想我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean she just wanted to express her concern because of your two days off. And she needed your help from class so she misses you. Only this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是啊，就這樣而已，那簡訊根本就沒什麼大不了的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '沒什麼大不了的' is translated as 'no big deal' which does not capture the intended meaning of 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second exhibit, the message at 23:55 on December 29th 2017 from the same phone, the content is ‘I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?’ and why did she send the message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳那封簡訊是想回答我那句中文是什麼意思
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean she send this message it do the homework, and what does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
在我老婆告我之前，我還有13個學分要拿，要拿到這13個學分我才能取得碩士學位，所以我還有作業和練習題要做
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the person needed to complete 30 credits, but the user's translation states that they still have 13 credits left to obtain.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has subject-verb agreement errors. The verb '要拿' should agree with the subject '我', but it is in the plural form.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the person needed to complete assignments and exercises as part of their program.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you explain first what did you study for the mast degree?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士課程大部分是英文課程，還有一些文化課程和能力課程。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'TESOL' as '碩士課程' which means 'master's program' instead of '教學英語為第二語言' which means 'Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that 'some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence'.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
You mean the degree you get is for English teaching but there are other culture and communication courses

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是啊，我記得至少有3堂是文化與溝通的課程。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what the assignment did they give you in the culture and communication courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'assignment' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這門課文化與溝通的課程每個學生的作業都不太一樣，像我是待台灣，我就必須要證明我可以精準的駕馭中文，還有我的中文能力這樣子。因此我中文很多都是中英翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我就必須要證明我可以精準的駕馭中文'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '駕馭中文' is translated as 'good command of Chinese,' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'being able to handle Chinese.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the assignments are about Chinese-English sentence translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean because you have to teach Taiwanese English so you have to prove your Chinese ability so there are a lot of Chinese and English assignments for you, is it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是啊，我的確有必要去精進我的口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So is it your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
中文字對我來說就是有幾個字很難辨認，所以我就寄了這封簡訊給她，請她翻譯過來。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean this message is only the answer of the assignment. You sent the Chinese words to her and she brought the Chinese answer to you, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就只是我作業的解答而已。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
The exhibit 1, page 14 to 16, are these all the answers to your assignments? You sent them because your assignment?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking help from the other person in the original text.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊全部都是作業要用的。

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
How do you explain about the love affair your wife filed
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我覺得我太太真的是想太多了，我知道她覺得我沒有能力撫養家庭。因為他都不支持我這個碩士學位，所以我只好問我同事，如果她肯支持我一點，我就不用問我同事了，我覺得她必須為這整個誤會負責。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural context

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, is that any unpleasant situations between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們一開始還不錯，但可能是教葡萄牙語的關係，可能就…。自從開始教葡萄牙語，工作的關係就一直起爭執，她覺得我都一直沒有盡我的力去工作，但其實我經常遇到挫折，我都沒辦法跟她說
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '但可能是教葡萄牙語的關係，可能就…'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '我們一開始還不錯' is translated as '我們一開始還不錯' which does not capture the idea of 'having some good time at the beginning of the marriage.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the speaker's employment and the issue it caused in the relationship.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Back to what you said about the master degree, when did the master degree begin, and has it finished and do you get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015開始，預計2017年結束，但因為我一直有在兼職，所以我一直無法完成我的碩士課程。就像我說的，我太太一點都不支持我，我必須獨力完成這個學位，我覺得很累很挫折挫敗。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我是在2015開始' is incorrect. It should be '我在2015年開始'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense in the sentence '我預計2017年結束' is incorrect. It should be '我預計在2017年結束'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the program being a two-year program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not finishing the program in May 2017.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about being too tired and frustrated.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling alone in pursuing the degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the lack of time to do course assignments due to working part-time.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the lack of support from their wife.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about their wife's lack of support.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling frustrated and defeated.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean the degree is for 2 years, but you didn’t fish it, why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '完成' as 'fish' instead of 'finish'.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒有辦法完成所有課程作業，還有一些課程必修。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So the registration for the semester, when did it end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後一個學期是2017年的春季。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '2017年的春季'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If you said is true, you mean the last registration is last until May 2107, and there will not be any assignments for you, but the messages between you and your colleague remained 7 months afterwards, could you explain why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated 結束日期 as 'last registration' instead of 'end date'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'is' before 'last' in the phrase 'last until May 2107', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'course' in the phrase 'course end date', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒能完成我的學位，並不代表我不想繼續精進我的中文能力，為了繼續精進中文能力，所以我一直有在試圖傳簡訊增進中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '為了繼續精進中文能力，所以我一直有在試圖增進中文。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of studying on their own in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean even though you didn’t finish the master degree, you still want to improve your Chinese ability and make your Chinese fluent more, is it right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
那就是我問我同事的目的，希望她幫我。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation does not accurately convey the cultural context of asking for help from a colleague.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the colleague plays the role of a house teacher for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the meaning of '家教' (house teacher) as '家教囉' (house teacher for you), which changes the intended meaning.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，還是我的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我想要付，但她婉拒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我想要付' instead of '我要想付'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'declined' as '婉拒' is not accurate. '婉拒' means to politely refuse, but 'declined' simply means to refuse without specifying whether it was done politely or not.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t her, why did she send the messages in the middle of the night? Doesn’t that exceed the relationship between you and the colleague?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是我說她為什麼總是這麼支持我，用盡所有的時間來教我中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這就是我說她為什麼總是這麼支持我，用所有的時間來教我中文。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still teaching in that school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific information about the type of school, which is important for understanding the context.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還繼續在那邊上班。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is this colleague working there, too?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她也繼續在在那邊教書，但我們不再是一個團隊了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們不再是一個團隊了' instead of '但不再是一個團隊了我們'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
 Prosecutor, is there any witness you want to subpoena or you want to investigate something?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena Ron-er Huang, the colleague from Mei-er-Mi cram school as a witness and asked her about the relationship with the man and the purpose to send the message.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant and the context of the text messages.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'subpoena' instead of 'summon' or 'call as a witness'.
grammar and structure	preposition errors	The user used the incorrect preposition 'from' instead of 'at' to indicate the location of the cram school.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have anything you want the court to investigate.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court in their translation, which is an important detail.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that school have taken action for the relationship between my husband and Ron-er Huang. I want this investigation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the specific action taken by the school.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the user's desire for an investigation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase 'my husband and Ron-er Huang', it should be 'Ron-er Huang and my husband'.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you want the court to investigate something for you? Now your master degree ended at June, 2017, you didn’t have any reason to send these messages with your colleagues. That’s really strange and especially these messages sent from your colleague were mostly sent after 9 pm, do you anything you want the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有想到什麼法院可以為我調查的證據，我只是像要加強我的中文能力罷了。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the communication between the colleague and themselves.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court is set at 4:30 pm on June 24th, 2018 and to subpoena the witness. The accuser and defendant have to be there. Both of you can have a lawyer.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the witness being questioned.

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.
我也明白。

3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。

如起訴書所載。
Same as the indictment.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re here for the preparation procedure for an adultery case. The accuser 宇涵王, she claimed that her husband… has an affair… her husband Edward Kapayashi has an affair with his coworker in his cram school. The accuser found some intimate messages in her husband cell phone, and all that messages showed her husband has more than… a relationship more than a coworker with her colleagues… and her husband often make up reasons for another worktime… and tele-conferencing in dark night. The defendant, your wife filed the lawsuit on you for adultery. What’s your plea?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	王宇涵 translated as 宇涵王
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Edward Takayashi translated as Edward Kapayashi
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in sentence structure
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	lack of subject-verb agreement
grammar and structure	tense errors	inconsistent use of tenses

omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of key information
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	addition of irrelevant details

cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misinterpretation of names and cultural context

Not guilty, of course.
我完全是無罪的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparation procedure, the court will investigate the details in the messages from your cell phone and we will consider that the messages are enough to constitute an adultery. And we will ask questions of you two. Do you both understand?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the court will investigate the messages from the defendant's cell phone, while the original text does not mention the defendant's cell phone specifically.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error by placing 'And we will ask questions of you two' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'constitute an adultery'.

我明白
I understand.

I understand.
我了解。

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have any child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'has you been married'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question does not include the information about having children, which is present in the original text.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years. We don’t have any child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'We don't have any children.'

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Are you married in Taiwan? Or other place?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan four years ago. He came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I met my husband in Taiwan four years ago.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the husband came to Taiwan specifically to teach Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past years, did he work as an Portuguese teacher?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
The time we met, he was an Portuguese teacher, and now he’s still teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese in Taiwan is not popular with people, so his teaching-hours are often not stable. (yeah… not stable… from one to two hours per week…) After that in order to make his income more stable, so he decided to teach English as well. But English is not his mother tongue, so he tried to seek an advanced degree.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '不穩定' as 'not stable' instead of 'unstable'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the frequency of his teaching-hours being one to two hours per week
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	adding irrelevant information about seeking an advanced degree

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just said that (X2) he wanted to… your husband wanted to seek an advanced degree. That means get an degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the original text mentions the husband wanting to get a degree in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, I mean he wants to… teach English, so the degree he needs is about a teaching qualification. My husband found a distance learning program on-line and it is a program from California, the United States. And the program provides on-line learning so that he doesn’t need to go to the USA and he can learn English on teaching… for teaching. After he finished his class, got his… all the credits he needs, he can… could obtain the master degree in the USA, and he can use the degree to teach English in Taiwan.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '取得的學位是關於英語教學的' as 'the degree he needs is about a teaching qualification' instead of 'the degree he needs is about English teaching'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect and the word order is unnatural.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the specific program being a distance learning program and from California, United States.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of the husband wanting to teach English in Taiwan.
omission or addition	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate '遠距教學課程' (distance learning program) and '碩士學位' (master degree).
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the idiomatic expression '函授的方式' (correspondence method) to the target language.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then, the relationship between your husband and the person he has affair with… what is the relationship?
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of the word 'husband'

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are coworkers in a cram school. The cram school… the class in the cram school needs a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher to teach English together. The affair person is the Chinese teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'The person is the Chinese teacher.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'affair' which is an important detail in the original text.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I often ask my husband why did he always stay up late in the cram school. It’s just an English class. There’s no need for staying up late in the cram school, but my husband told me that he had something to discuss with his Chinese teacher… for teaching. I did not… doubt my husband at first, but days pass… days has passed, my husband would get some calls in our home after getting off the cram school, and he will answer the phone into… in his study room so I have no choice but to doubt him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in 'days pass' instead of 'days have passed'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in 'my husband would get' instead of 'my husband gets'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in 'days pass' instead of 'days have passed'
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in 'I did not... doubt' instead of 'I did not doubt'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of 'to me' in 'he will answer the phone into... in his study room so I have no choice but to doubt him'
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	Omission of 'cram school' in 'There’s no need for staying up late in the cram school'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything inordinary stuffs… messages?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
There is a same num… a very same number in his phone record so I checked my husband cell phone’s messages, and I found that my husband chatted with the woman very often.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'chatted' does not accurately convey the meaning of '通簡訊' which means 'texting' or 'exchanging text messages'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not mention that the husband and the woman exchange text messages 'almost every day'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
It just… they are just text messages. Anything not okay?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the tone and formality of the original text

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they are some work stuff messages, that’s okay. I found very intimate words the woman used to text in the message, and my husband is married with me, you know, so that’s quite not okay.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misinterpreted the original text and added their own interpretation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please display the exhibit file on page 13. The accuser, are these your… the messages you said…

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這就是…這些是我手機上的訊息。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Well then I am going to ask you some questions about these messages. The first message was sent at 09:50 p.m. on December 21st, 2017 from the cell phone number 0958-932123, and the message said, “I miss you, my love”, what do you want to say?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'really' as 'want to'

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那只是我同事發給我的訊息啊。我記得我那時候剛好放了兩天假，我同事就只是關心我而已啊。我同事在美國讀書然後畢業…在美國接受教育的，所以她的思想相對也是開放許多。我們就…平常打打鬧鬧的…我們對於在乎的人會說my love這樣。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So you mean that your coworker is westernized on his… her thoughts and her expression for feelings because she got the education in the US, so “my love” is nothing special?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the meaning of 'westernized' and the cultural significance of 'my love'.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
沒錯，那就只是…對於在乎的人所傳達的關心方式，真的沒有什麼。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous sentence… in the message?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the previous sentence in the translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，我們就是同事。然後她很…比較擔心我一點，因為我兩天都沒去上班去放假這樣。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'partners at work' as '同事' which means 'colleagues' instead of '合作伙伴' which means 'partners'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was away for two days, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the information that the speaker was on vacation, which is not mentioned in the original text.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that… your coworker she is quite… she missed you because you have two day-off and there is no assistance on teaching…
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對，訊息的內容就是這樣，它的意思也是這樣。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent from the same… the exact same number at 11:55 p.m. on December 29th, 2017. The content is… writes as when can she be with you… “I want you so bad…”
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她這樣說只是為了告訴我，我在…我的一個…我剛剛寫到一個中文的作業要怎樣表達這樣…要怎樣表達一個豐富情感的句子。

omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the specific details mentioned in the original text.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You saying that she sent you the message to help you on your assignment...? What are you talking about?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像之前…先前我老婆跟你們講的…我太太跟你們講的，我正在攻讀一個英語教學的碩士學位，而我需要30個學分才可以完成這個學位，所以在這之前有一些習作也是很正常的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of assignments and exercises.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation does not convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you first explain your… what exactly you are preparing for the degree.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位是有關TESOL這個英語教學的系統…然後裡面除了英語教學外，也有一些文化相關的課程…或是語言能力相關的課程。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'system' was translated as '系統' instead of '課程' which is the correct translation in this context.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'courses' was translated as '課程' instead of '科目' which is a more accurate translation in this context.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So, the program you take needs not… has not only TESOL or… and courses about culture…communication…
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the sentence, which changes the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the word 'not' in the sentence, which changes the meaning of the original text.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misunderstood the meaning of 'TESOL' and 'culture communication' courses, which are related to teaching English as a second language and not specifically about cultural communication.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對啊，有至少三個是有關文化溝通的課程。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What kind of assignment the courses will need you to complete?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'need' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'complete' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通的課程對每個人來說…每個人選的都有點不同，像我現在住在台灣，而且我準備要來教英文，所以我會需要這個…會需要一些能力在中文上。所以囉，我的一些作業就是有關中英翻譯的一些句子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of proving competence in Chinese.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '溝通' (communication) instead of '文化溝通' (culture and communication).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'assignments' as '作業' (homework) instead of '課程' (courses).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'sentence translation' as '句子' (sentences) instead of '句子翻譯' (sentence translation).

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, according to your words, the program you need… and you need to translate some sentences between Chinese and English, right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the specific assignments and focused only on the general requirement of translating sentences.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對，我也需要精進我的閱讀跟寫作的能力在中文方面。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'speaking' as '閱讀' (reading) instead of '口說' (speaking).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'writing' as '寫作' (writing) instead of '寫作' (writing).

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s get back to the sentence. It is one of your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是啊，我讀到了一些句子，可是你也知道有一些中文字對外國人來說就是比較難理解，所以我請我的同事翻譯給我…翻譯成英文給我，讓我去明白句子的意思。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The translation does not adapt the idiomatic expression '对外国人来说' to the target language.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Well, you are telling me that you ask your coworker to translate the sentence into English… from Chinese to English for you, and that is the answer… and then send text message to you as the answer for your exercises?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the text message being the answer for the exercises.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那個就只是我功課的…那個訊息就只是我功課的解答。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
The defendant, we will go on to show you the file on page… the exhibit on page 14 to 16. So these are all part of your homework, right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the text messages on pages 14 to 16.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，這些所有看到的句子都是在幫助我完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the messages in their translation.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then, in terms of the affair your wife accused you, what’s your explanation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
對此，我真的是覺得我太太真的是想太多了，我真的沒有做什麼。而且我也只是想讓自己可以更支持這個家這樣。而且庭上，請你知道，我在進修的時候我太太是完全沒給任何精神支持的。我太太真的是沒有幫助我太多，如果她能對於我在進修這件…進修英文這件事上，提供更多的協助的話，我也就不需要拜託我的同事來協助我，她才是那個需要被責怪的人。而且還造成這些誤解，真的很抱歉。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'support'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'degree' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'colleague' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'misunderstanding' in the translation

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your words, there’s… there seems to be unpleasure… unhappiness between you and your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '相處不愉快' as 'unpleasure' instead of 'unhappiness'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'there's' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'unhappiness'.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們剛…結婚沒多久的時候，我們都還…相處地都還很愉快很融洽，可是我的工作就是很不穩定，尤其在授課時數方面，因為真的沒什麼人要學葡萄牙文。所以漸漸地我們常為了我的工作而爭吵，我老婆都不知道我做了多少努力在想要去好好地維持這份工作上，而她也完全不知道我有多挫敗在遭遇了這些失敗上。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	相處地都還很愉快很融洽 should be 相處得都還很愉快很融洽
grammar and structure	word order errors	我們剛結婚沒多久的時候 should be 我們剛結婚沒多久
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of fighting and frustration

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s get back to your program. When did it start? When did it end? (Do you know? And can you tell us?)
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the completion of the master's program and obtaining the degree.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2015年秋天開始了…開始去參與這個課程，它是個兩年期的課程。原本預計是在2017年5月會結束，可是我陸陸續續地在打工啊什麼的，所以我也是沒有完成這個學位這樣。就像我說的，我太太在對於我…進修英文這方面真的是沒有給予很大的支持，日子久了我也就感到很疲倦因為讓我覺得我是自己在奮鬥的這樣子，我真的很灰心。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我在2015年秋天開始了…開始去參與這個課程'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我太太在對於我…進修英文這方面真的是沒有給予很大的支持'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling unsupported by the wife in the sentence '我太太在對於我…進修英文這方面真的是沒有給予很大的支持'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling frustrated in the sentence '我真的很灰心'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not having enough time to do course assignments in the sentence '我陸陸續續地在打工啊什麼的，所以我也是沒有完成這個學位這樣'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '我陸陸續續地在打工啊什麼的，所以我也是沒有完成這個學位這樣'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '我陸陸續續地在打工啊什麼的，所以我也是沒有完成這個學位這樣'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '我陸陸續續地在打工啊什麼的，所以我也是沒有完成這個學位這樣'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '我陸陸續續地在打工啊什麼的，所以我也是沒有完成這個學位這樣'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '我陸陸續續地在打工啊什麼的，所以我也是沒有完成這個學位這樣'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You’re saying that the course is a two-year course. But why did you… didn’t you accomplish it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
因為我沒辦法完成所有課程的作業。還有一些課程相關的規定。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not being able to finish the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So when is the last semester of your registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後一個學期是在2017年的春天。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'registration' in their translation.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
We know that your course ended in May 2017, then after this… after all of this, why… why those messages can… will show up in your text messages record…
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the text messages being recorded in the text messages record.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我沒辦法完成我的學業，也不代表我不想要精進我的中文能力。所以我為了更精進它，所以我就是自己繼續學下去這樣。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我就是自己繼續學下去這樣，為了更精進它。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
According to that, even if you did not finish the course, you still want to make progress in your Chinese, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
對啊，這就是為什麼我才要向我同事尋求協助。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
Well, the role your coworker play is kind of tutor of your Chinese?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor of your Chinese' instead of 'private tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅僅是我的中文家教，她真的是一個很好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her for the tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有…我有試著要付錢給她，可是她說不用。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有試著要付錢給她，可是她說不用。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
Well, you didn’t pay her. But why did she text you in such night… That is telling that you are beyond coworkers’ relationships?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以囉，我說，她真的是很幫助我的一個朋友。尤其花了…犧牲了她那些時間來幫助我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她真的是很幫助我的一個朋友' instead of '我說，她真的是很幫助我的一個朋友'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the friend using her own time to help learn Chinese. The correct translation should include '尤其花了…犧牲了她那些時間來幫助我學中文'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work as an English teacher in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我依然在那裏就職。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我依然在那裏就職。'

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
So do your coworker?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她依然在那邊上班，但我們已經不再是教學的夥伴了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不再是教學的夥伴了' instead of '但我們已經不再是教學的夥伴了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, any more witness or any further evidence needed to be investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
Your honor, I would like to subpoena the defendant’s coworker 蓉兒黃 at his 美而美 cram school. I would like to ask her about the detail and the intention about those messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the relationship between the witness and the defendant, as well as the background and purpose of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, anything you want… is there anything you want the court to investigate?

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has take some… has taken action for the incident my husband and his coworker… and I even heard that the cram school asked his coworker to step out of the work.
semantic conversion	word choice errors	incorrect word choice
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	subject-verb agreement error
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of important information

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
And the defendant, is there anything you want the court to help you investigate? It is a fact that the defendant your course is… your courses ended May 2017, so there’s no need about the assignment stuff you need to deal with, and that makes those messages quite dubious because you received them in the really night and that is quite out of control.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'It is a fact that the defendant your course is…'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '起人疑竇' as 'out of control', which does not convey the correct meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's evidence that could help their case.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我真的沒有什麼證據想要法院為我調查。就…一直都像我說的，我跟她會聊天，真的是單純就是我想精進我的中文，因為我真的想繼續學它這樣。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我說的一樣'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation of 'the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple' as '我跟她會聊天，真的是單純' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the reason for the communication was to improve language ability and continue learning Chinese, not just casual chatting.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the next court is set on… at 04:30 p.m. on June 24th, 2018. The court will ask some questions from the witness, and both the accuser and the defendant need to come to the court and both of you can hire a lawyer.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the witness being questioned in the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of the possibility of both parties hiring a lawyer if necessary.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the instruction for both the accuser and the defendant to attend the court hearing.

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.
我也明白。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

The plaintiff, Yu Han Wang, he sued his husband Edward for that he had a…he had an affair with his colleague in a cram school, 王柔兒, they not only have intimate message, and…but also Edward usually make up reasons for having extra work; moreover, they also have tele-conferencing, and their relationship is beyond coworker’s relationship.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？

我明白

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Now I am going to ask the plaintiff. How long have you married with your husband. Do you have any children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I have been married with my husband and…for four years, and we don’t have any children.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
And did you married in Taiwan or in other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met with my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I met my husband in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they met their husband in Taiwan.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in these years, does he…did  he teach Portuguese as his work?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. And after we got married, he continues to teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hour is not steady, and sometime his…he had a period between jobs for about one or two months.  Because teaching Portuguese is not a steady work, he decided to teach English, and because his mother tongue is not English, he went to seek an advance degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'And after we got married, he continues to teach Portuguese' is incorrect. It should be 'And after we got married, he continued to teach Portuguese.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'one or two months of' in the sentence 'And after we got married, he continues to teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hour is not steady, and sometime his…he had a period between jobs for about one or two months.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'for about one or two months' in the sentence 'And after we got married, he continues to teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hour is not steady, and sometime his…he had a period between jobs for about one or two months.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'teaching' in the sentence 'Because teaching Portuguese is not a steady work, he decided to teach English.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'to' in the sentence 'Because teaching Portuguese is not a steady work, he decided to teach English.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'an' in the sentence 'Because teaching Portuguese is not a steady work, he decided to teach English, and because his mother tongue is not English, he went to seek an advance degree.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'advanced' in the sentence 'Because teaching Portuguese is not a steady work, he decided to teach English, and because his mother tongue is not English, he went to seek an advance degree.'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that he… seek an advance degree. Do you mean that he had…studied for a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he needs a degree in English teaching. He..he had a distance learning program which is from California in the United States, and…and the learning is a distance online learning, so he can learn…he can learn in Taiwan, and also…therefore, through the credits from the online program, he can get the master degree in English teaching, and then he can teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then what is the relationship between your husband and the so call affair…the person he had affair with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇對象' as 'the person he had affair with' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleague. They…they work in a same cram school, and the cram had a program to have a foreign teacher and a Taiwanese teacher and to be partner with teaching, and she is the person who partner with him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'They are colleagues.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '補習班' as 'cram school' is incorrect. It should be translated as 'tutoring center' or 'cram school'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the cram school has a program with a foreign teacher and a Taiwanese teacher partnering in teaching.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the person mentioned is the Taiwanese teacher in his class.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How do you know' instead of 'How do you know they'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, my husband usually make up reasons for having extra work and stay in the cram school. I asked him for the reason, and he said that he has to communicate with the Taiwanese teacher to talk more about their work. But I think he’s just a English teacher, why he have to stay in the cram school for so long. At first, I didn’t suspect him, but he started to have some phone calls after his work, and moreover, when he pick up the calls, he would avoid me and went to the study room. And I started to suspect him and check up his cell phone.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'make up reasons' as 'having extra work'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the mention of the husband being an English teacher

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So did you find anything wrong with his cell phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I check his phone call record and saw that he almost had phone call with the same person every day. And then I check his text…I check his message and see that he text with the same person with a woman almost every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '查他的簡訊' as 'check his text' instead of 'check his message'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
I think texting people is not a very unusual thing. So is there anything wrong with the messages.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting the cultural appropriateness of texting

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
I think the message with ordinary content is fine. But he is a man…but he had got married, and how can he have message with some intimate content with other people. I had provided some information about their message, and I think all the evidence are in the files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '已婚的人' as 'a man who had got married' instead of 'a married person'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omits the mention of providing the messages to the court as evidence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user fails to mention that the evidence is in the files.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
So the…so the file and is the message you mean on the phone call text?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些就是我手機上的內容。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I am going to ask you based on these…these contents. The first message is…was sent from the cell phone 0958-932123 on 21:50…at 21:50 on 12/21 in 2017, and the content is “I really miss you”. What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
痾那就只是同事寄給我的簡信。那個時候我剛請了兩天假，他很擔心，所以才寄這樣的簡訊給我。我的同事他之前在美國讀過書，所以她的表達方式也比較開放，這就是他說話的方式，就像是說「我的愛」這樣子，這都是很正常的表達方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural expression

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So you mean that because this person has stayed in the foreign countries and his…her concept is westernized, so…her expression is just this kind of opened,  and it’s very ordinary and this is nothing wrong with her words, right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the cultural meaning of '我的愛'

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對，那就只是普通…那種表達方式很普通，就只是好朋友或是很親密的朋友間的表達方式。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
So what about the sentence he sent you…she sent you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，我們是同事，在我…在我請了兩天假之後，他當然會很想念我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So do you mean that the other party sent you this message is just because you are out of work for two days, and he miss you and he miss you because she work without your assistance in class, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order, resulting in a confusing sentence structure.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，那個簡訊內容並沒有甚麼問題。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
And let’s see the second message. That’s from the same person’s cell phone and the time was at 23:55 on12/29,2017, and message content is 我很想要你在我身邊，你甚麼時候可以在我身邊呢? I…So what do you think about this message. What does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他會寄給我那封簡訊是因為他想教我要怎麼表達這樣子的意思。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他會寄給我那封簡訊' instead of '他會寄給我那封簡訊是因為'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of '要怎麼表達這樣子的意思', it should be '要怎麼在我的作業中表達一個中文句子'.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that the reason why she sent you this message was because she wanted to help you with your assignment? What does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就如同我老婆之前在法庭上說的，我有一個碩士學位的一個計劃，在那個計劃裡我要…需要拿到三十個學分，這就是拿到學分的其中一個作業，他只是協助我完成這個作業。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '協助' (assist) does not accurately convey the meaning of 'complete' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about completing assignments and exercises, which is important for understanding the context.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
So please explain what master degree are you…did you get?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是英語教學，然後他有一部份是關於英文，另外一部份是關於文化還有語言能力。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '碩士學位' is translated as 'program' instead of 'degree'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我的碩士學位是英語教學，其中一部分與英文教學有關，另一部分與文化和語言能力有關。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'courses' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the word 'courses' in the sentence.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The translation does not adapt the idiomatic expression 'some of the courses' to the target language.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you mean that the master degree you get was TESOL, and it includes some language competence ability, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的。我記得至少三堂課是跟文化還有語言能力有關溝通…能力有關。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'culture and communication' as '文化還有語言能力有關溝通能力', which means 'communication ability related to culture and language ability'. The meaning is not accurately conveyed.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what was the assignment in the…in the cultural and communication courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'assignment' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'assignment' at the end of the sentence instead of the beginning.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通課程出的作業是因人而異的，像我是一個在台灣然後想要在台灣能夠教英文的人，我的作業就要去展現出我對中文有多麼了解。所以我的作業有很多都是關於中英的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'good command of Chinese' as '對中文有多麼了解', which means 'how much understanding of Chinese' instead of 'good command of Chinese'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of proving competence in the translation assignments.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the goal of reaching a teaching position as an English teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the assignments being related to culture and communication courses.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean that because you wanted to teach English in Taiwan, your assignments from the master degree is usually about translating the sentences between Chinese and English, and your assignments was to finish these translation and to…and to express how well you did in Chinese.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，除此之外，我還必須展現我的… 精進我的閱讀跟寫作能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok, let’s get back to the message, so you mean the message is your assignment?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out critical context

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，那就是我的作業。你知道有的時候中文字對外國人來說是很困難的，所以我寄給她…所以我寄給她那句話請她幫我翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of asking the colleague for help.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The translation does not adapt the idiomatic expression '寄給她' (send to her) to the target language.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you mean you sent her the sentence in English and she sent you back the sentence in Chinese and…and the sentence is just the answer of your assignment, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就只是我作業的解答。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Ok, let’s see the… show the page 14 to 16 on file one and check the message content…contents, and are these messages all the answer about your…all the answer to your assignment?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊都是為了完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
How do you explain to your wife’s…to your wife’s words that she said you have an affair with your colleague?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'explain' instead of 'respond to' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'to your wife's words' in the wrong position in the sentence.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我覺得我太太想太多了，我覺得他只是不滿意我在這個家庭裡面的付出，但是在我一開始學習的時候他也沒有給我任何的支持或支援。他在我拿到…他在我拿碩士學位的過程中，也並沒有展現要支持我的意思，這也是為甚麼我要轉而尋求我同事的協助，那都是因為他根本就不支持我，我覺得他應該為這件事情負責
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of pronouns
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of wife's lack of support
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	adding unnecessary details about asking colleague for help

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your words, is there anything wrong with your relationship between your wife and you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們一開始剛結婚的時候，我們的確相處得很好，但是後來因為我工作的關係，我一開始沒有辦法有穩定的工作時數。因此，工作這件事情就成為我們爭吵的主要原因，我們為了這件事情已經爭吵了非常多次，我也覺得很沮喪，但是也沒有甚麼發洩的方法。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '在我們一開始剛結婚的時候' is incorrect. It should be '在我們剛結婚的時候一開始'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '相處得很好' should agree with the plural subject '我們', so it should be '相處得很好' instead of '相處得很好'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb '相處得很好' should be in the past tense to match the time frame of '一開始剛結婚的時候'. It should be '相處得很好' instead of '相處得很好'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '但是後來因為我工作的關係' is incorrect. It should be '但是後來因為我的工作關係'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我一開始沒有辦法有穩定的工作時數' is incorrect. It should be '我一開始沒有辦法有穩定的工作時數'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '因此，工作這件事情就成為我們爭吵的主要原因' is incorrect. It should be '因此，工作這件事情就成為我們的主要爭吵原因'.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我也覺得很沮喪，但是也沒有甚麼發洩的方法' is incorrect. It should be '我也覺得很沮喪，但是也沒有甚麼發洩的方法'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok, let’s get back to the…your master degree. When did you started to study for the master degree, and when…when did you get this degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the question structure

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2015秋天的時候開始這個碩士學位課程，並且本應要在2017年的五月拿到學位，但是因為我…並且本來應該…並且這是一個兩年課程，我本來應要在2017年的五月拿到學位，但是因為我自己還有申請其他工作，所以就沒有足夠的時間完成這個學位。就像我說的，我太太在這件事情上面並沒有很支持我，所以就變成好像是我一個人在完成這件事情，讓我覺得很累，讓我很累也很沮喪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我在2015秋天的時候開始這個碩士學位課程'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我本來應要在2017年的五月拿到學位'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '但是因為我自己還有申請其他工作，所以就沒有足夠的時間完成這個學位'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '就像我說的，我太太在這件事情上面並沒有很支持我'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '讓我很累也很沮喪'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So you mean the degree…the program is two years and you didn’t finish it on time, so what is the reason?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
因為我並沒有完成所有的課程的作業。還有一些課程的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not finishing the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So when was the last semester that you registered?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後一個有註冊的學期是2017年的春天。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'registration' in their translation.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So you mean that you have finish your… study program on…in May in 2017 but you continue to text your colleague for over 7 months after your study, so what is the reason?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misinterpreted the original text and changed the meaning of the sentence.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成這個學位，但是也並不代表說我就沒有再繼續學習了，雖然我沒有完成學位，但是我還是想要去精進我的語言，所以我才會在停止這個學習計畫之後，繼續跟我同事詢問相關的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that even if you didn’t finish the program, you still continue to keep studying Chinese and wanted to make your Chinese more influent, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是，那就是我為甚麼跟我同事尋求幫助。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the position of your colleague is just like your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'role model'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不僅是像家教一樣，還是我的非常好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '不僅是家教一樣' instead of '是像家教一樣'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Then did you paid her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'Did you paid her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
不，我想要付給她錢，但是他拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想要付給她錢' instead of '我想要付給她錢'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If…if you didn’t pay her, then why did she answer your message at midnight at such a time that people should go to bed? I think the relationship is beyond the…an ordinary period.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是我說的他非常的支持我，然後也是我非常好的朋友，而且他都用自己的時間來幫助我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' is used instead of '她', which means 'he' instead of 'she'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the phrase 'to help me learn Chinese'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
So are you teaching English in the same cram school.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'still' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I am still working there.
是，我還在那邊工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does this colleague still working there?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'working' should be in the present continuous tense to match the subject 'colleague'.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
他還在那邊繼續工作，但是我們並沒有在一起搭檔。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是我們並沒有在一起搭檔，他還在那邊繼續工作。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you need to have any people here, or you want to see any evidence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to have 王柔兒, who is the colleague work with the defendant in 美而美cram school, to be here to explain the messages and the relationship between the defendant and her.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '王柔兒' instead of '黃蓉兒'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '美而美補習班' as '美而美cram school', which is not an accurate translation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that 美而美 cram school took some action to this… and they even try to persuade the 王柔兒to quit her job. I want to check if this thing is true or false.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of names

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you need anything the court to investigate for you? The situation is that you have already finish your… finish the program in May in 2017, and you… keep on having messages with 王柔兒and almost the messages are after 9 p.m. at night, and it’s really not an ordinary situation. So what… evidence can you offer to the court to help yourself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'you have already finish your… finish the program'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'and you… keep on having messages'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Incorrect translation of '黃蓉兒' as '王柔兒'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'almost the messages are after 9 p.m. at night'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Incorrect translation of '案情' as 'yourself'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有任何法庭...需要法庭來幫我調查的事情，但是就像我所說的，我只是想要精進自己的中文能力，然後跟我的同事也只是非常單純的關係。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'evidence' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '需要法庭來幫我調查的事情' (the things that the court needs to investigate for me) at the beginning of the sentence, which changes the intended meaning and structure of the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'improve my language ability' as '精進自己的中文能力' (improve my Chinese language ability), which is a mismatched meaning as the original text does not specify the language being improved.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
We are going to have the next court at 4:30 p.m. on 6/24 in 2018. And we will have the witness here, and we need the plaintiff and the defendant both of you be here, and both of you have the right to the lawyer. Do you understand?

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's right to choose their own legal counsel.

3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
Third, the defendant has the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help him with his case.

被告是否了解以上權利？
Does the defendant fully understand his rights?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'understand' should agree with the subject 'defendant', so it should be 'Does the defendant understand his rights?'

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
The defendant, you have been prosecuted of ……an adultery case, and today is the preparatory procedure. The accuser, Yu-Han Wang, filed the lawsuit because…he, she found her husband, Edward Takayashi, was ……too, close to his co-worker, which was, ugh …Rong-Er Huang in…the working place. And Edward Takayashi, the …defendant, umm …… often …make up reasons for working for extra time, and the accuser found in the defendant’s cellphone that there are some intimate messages with this Rong-Er Huang. And the accuser think that they are beyond the co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, she filed this lawsuit.The defendant, your wife ……suspected that you …have an adultery, you have an …you have an affair with others. What’s your plea?

Not guilty, of course.
無罪，答辯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '答辩，无罪。'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, ugh …the main goal is to …investigate …the message between the defendant and his co-worker. Do you both …do both party understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

我明白
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
我明白了。

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long …ugh, was your marriage with your husband? Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
Ugh we have been married for four years, and we don’t have a child
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'we have' instead of 'we has'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the speaker being married to her husband.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
And ……are you married in Taiwan, or you get married in foreign countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan, and he want to taught Portuguese.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'want' should be in the past tense to agree with the past time frame.
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	The translation does not include the cultural context of the husband wanting to teach Portuguese in Taiwan.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past few years, ugh his work in Taiwan is to teach Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, ugh he was a Protu …Portuguese teacher. And …ugh after we get married …we got married, ugh… he kept teaching Portuguese.Ugh because there are not very ……very much person in Taiwan want to learn Portuguese, so ugh his teaching hours were not very stable, sometimes umm …there are only few hours, and …umm even one or two months.And …ugh in order to let his income more stable, he started to want to teach English. However, English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he …want to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean that he want to …earn another degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of '進修' as 'earn another degree'

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, I mean ugh because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan. So, ugh his degree must be somehow related to English teaching,Ugh he found a distance learning program on the Internet, which ugh …was provided by …umm California in American …America. So therefore, he didn’t have to go out, then he can ugh …he can a..a..achieve his learning through the distance learning.So after he …finished …all his …umm …scores and umm …lessens, he would get his …a master degree, so he didn’t need to go to the United States, but he can get his degree and teach English in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then what is the relationship between your husband and the person he  had an affair with this time?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'husband' in the translation.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school. And ugh that cram school, umm… has, ugh …required ugh …all the teachers partner with another one, to ugh make a Chinese teacher partner with a foreign teacher, And that person was his Chinese teacher in his class.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the female teacher being part of a pair teaching arrangement.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The translation fails to provide the necessary context about the cram school and its teaching arrangement.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I just found that my husband …ugh often worked for extra hours, so I asked him that ugh, “It was just an American cram school, so why did you work for extra hours that often?” He said that ugh because they have to work with a Chinese teacher so there are many things to communicate.I didn’t suspect him in the very beginning. However, I started to ……umm discover that after he went home, he often picked up phones. And there are many phone calls for him. And when he answered those phones, he didn’t ugh answer them in my front, he often go into his study room to answer those phones. So I started to be confused. So I checked his phone message.

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence: 'So I started to be confused.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence: 'So I checked his phone message.'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything you think is not normal in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
Umm ……it is ugh …phone records, ugh … there are not ugh … there are not anything …anything …unnormal. Therefore I checked his umm text message, and found out that he often text with another person …another woman, and always umm …almost every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even if he sent text message, it’s quite alright …right? Or …if the contents in the messages is not proper?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If the message …the text messages are just something normal, I won’t be like …like this. However, ugh …his was a married man, so why …ugh did the woman send some very intimate words to him? I think I have provided some of his text message in …ugh, to the court. And there are …I think there are in the files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Exhibit hasten …evidence one. Page 13. And here is …some text message …ugh the contents of some text messages. Ugh may the defendant check if this message is in your cellphone.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是，這是我寄過的簡訊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Well, then I want to ask some questions …umm ……toward these messages.The first message was sent at …ugh, 9:50 PM on December 21st, 2017, and it was sent by a phone number, 0958932123, to your phone. And the content is “我真的好想你呀，我的愛人。” What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那是我一個同事寄給我的訊息。我記得那時候我請了兩天假，那就是為什麼她寄這封簡訊給我。我同事是受美國教育的，所以她的個性非常的開放，她講話都是這樣。然後至於那個「my love」，那只是我們互稱我們關心的人的方式。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'colleague' as '同事' instead of '同僚'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'open-minded' as '開放' instead of '思想開明'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'expressed herself' as '講話都是這樣' instead of '表達自己'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'my love' as '我們互稱我們關心的人的方式' instead of '我們愛的人'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Ugh so you mean that this colleague was westernized, so ……her expressions are open-minded, so umm …you don’t think this message is not proper, right? Is that true?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation misinterprets the cultural context and fails to convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
沒有。這只是一個非常一般朋友打招呼的方式。我們對關心的人、朋友，就是這樣。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
Then how about ……the forward line?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Then how about the forward line?'

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我已經說過了。我們是同事，我們在那家補習班是搭檔。那時候我請了兩天假，所以當然，她…她會想我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們是同事，我們在那家補習班是搭檔。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was away for two days, which is an important detail in the original text.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Did you say that because you took a two-days off, so without your …ugh help in her class, she ……was quite missing you. Is that right? Is that only …is that the only thing? Is that simply like that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對，我就是這樣說的。那個簡訊…就只是這樣而已，沒什麼大不了。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '沒什麼大不了' is translated as 'no big deal' which does not capture the intended meaning of 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, so …the second message. It was sent at, ugh 11:55 PM on December 29th, 2017 from the same phone number. And the ……context was, ”I want you by my …ugh, 我想要你在我身邊，我們什麼時候才能真正地在一起？” What does this mean this time?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她是想要幫助我寫這個句子，因為我那時候在寫一個中文的功課。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Did you say that ……ugh, the …ugh this person sent you this message because she wanted to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
我妻子剛剛也在…呃…她的……她被問問題的時候說過了。我正在修一個碩士學程，呃，為了要修完這個學程，我必須要修滿30個學分。所以我當然有一些作業要做。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of attending a Master's program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the requirement of completing assignments and exercises.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation includes unnecessary hesitation and repetition.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Would you please explain first that ho …ugh what is your major for the master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是英語教學。嗯，那個碩士學位，呃有一些部分是跟英語教學有關，其他部分跟文化和語言能力有關。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '碩士學位' which means 'master's degree' instead of '課程' which means 'program' in this context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我的碩士學位是英語教學' is incorrect. It should be '英語教學是我的碩士學位'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the program is called TESOL.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds the word '嗯' which is unnecessary and not present in the original text.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation lacks appropriate politeness markers such as '請問' or '敬啟者' which are commonly used in formal contexts in Chinese.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
Ugh, so your master degree is TESOL, however, there are something in that related to culture and language competence. Is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of specific courses related to cultural communication in the original text.
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation lacks the appropriate level of formality and politeness compared to the original text.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是，我記得有三堂課跟文化與溝通有關。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'at least' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
Then about this kind of courses related to culture and communication, ugh what assignments would these courses, ugh, required you to ……achieve? to complete?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
呃，這種文化與溝通課程給每個人的作業都不太一樣。就舉我自己的例子而言，因為我是一個在台灣的外國人，然後想要，嗯…在台灣得到…可以、可以教英文的能力，所以我必須要表現出我對中文的…掌握能力。所以我很多的作業都是跟中英翻譯有關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '因為我是一個在台灣的外國人，然後想要，嗯…在台灣得到…可以、可以教英文的能力'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'culture and communication courses' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation' in the translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Well, you mean that because you plan to teach English in Taiwan. So umm … these courses ugh … required you to complete some assignments, and these assignments are related to Chinese and English sentences translation. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important information in the translation

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的。另外我也要精進自己的口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay then let’s go back to ……the text … the text message. Did you say that this …is …your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得那時候我看到這個句子的時候，我不是很能理解它到底在寫什麼。你也知道的，對外國人來說，中文字有一些非常地難以閱讀、難以辨認，所以我就給我的同事看了這個句子，然後請她告訴我這句話用英文怎麼說，並把它打成簡訊寄給我。

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user's translation does not accurately interpret the difficulty of recognizing Chinese characters for foreigners.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Did you mean that, ugh…because you asked your co-worker to …told you the answer of this sentence …the translation of this sentence and send you a text message to, ugh …for the answer, so this message was simply the answer of your assignment? Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那條簡訊只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Okay then let’s ugh …take a look at exhibit evidence one, page 14, the text messages contexts. Could you …ugh …take a look at those contents? Are they all …related to your assignment? Are these all because of ugh …you need the answers for your assignment? So you sent these messages?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，全部的簡訊都只是為了要完成作業。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then ugh …according to what your wife just said that you had an affair with another person, do you have anything to say?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
呃，對這件事，我認為我的妻子想太多了。我知道她一直對我無法支持這個家庭經濟的能力感到失望、不滿；但我想說的是，從我開始上這、這、這個課程到現在，我的妻子也沒有提供我任何幫…任何支持。她從來都沒有…表現出支持我的樣子，對於我念碩士這一件事情。那就是為什麼我會尋求我的同事幫助我做作業。如果她可以多一…表現出多一點點支持，我可能就不會尋求我同事了。我認為，關於這件事情，她應該要受到責備。

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in sentence

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you just said, you and your wife seem to be not ugh …very …accordance in your getting along with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'accordance' is not the correct word choice in this context.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們剛結婚的時候，我們確實滿快樂的。但後來出現了問題，而這問題就是關於我的工作。因為我想在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是這份工作又不太穩定。於是後來這件事情就變成我們之間的問題。我們常常為了這個吵架，她不相信我已經盡我最大的努力，所以…我也沒有讓她知道我所面臨的艱難處境以及…困難的狀況。

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Well, okay. Then let’s go back to …ugh, the master …courses you …just mentioned …about. So did you finish your master courses, all of your credits? Did you get the master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這個碩士是從2015年的秋天開始的。然後它是一個兩年的碩士學位，所以我應該要在2017年的5月完成這個學位。但是我並沒有完成。因為我又開始做一些兼職工作，所以我一直沒有時間可以好好地完成我的作業。就像我剛所說的，我的太太並沒有ㄕ…表示出任何的支持。所以在追求這個碩士學位的時候，我覺得我是一個人在讀這個學位的。我覺得非常地沮喪與挫折。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You said that this master degree is ugh …a two-year courses program, but you didn’t finish and complete it in the end. Why is that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
因為我無法完成所有的作業。也無法達到一部分要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not being able to finish the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
Then …ugh for the registration ……of this master degree, what is the last ……semester?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
嗯我最後一個學期，是……2017年的春天。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If the things you’ve said is true, then ugh …your assignments should have been …ugh, in an …should have been an end in May, 2017. However, after 7 months ugh in December, you and your co-worker’s messages are continuing. Why is that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the specific date in the translation

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
即使我無法完成我的碩士學位，但我仍然想精進我的中文能力。所以雖然我沒有辦法成功地拿到碩士，我…仍然繼續自己研讀中文。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'Chinese ability' in the translation.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You …ugh, what do you mean is that, even if you can’t …ugh get your master degree, you still wanted to …sharper your Chinese ……and let your Chinese be more fluently. Is that right?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'sharper' instead of 'improve' to convey the idea of making their Chinese language skills better.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect and lacks clarity.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not completing the master's degree, which is an important detail in the original text.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
沒錯，那就是為什麼我…請我的同事幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the co, co, colleague, this colleague, ……ugh the role she played was ugh …somehow like your …homeroom teacher?
grammar and structure	word order errors	repetition and hesitation in the translation

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，她還是我一個真正的好友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Then did you pay her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有欸，我有提出我想要給她錢的要…呃，我我有、我有…
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If she declined, then why …ugh did that … she still send messages in the midnight? I think this is somehow ugh …be more to her ……responsibility?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個…我非常好的朋友，也很支持我。她會用她自己的時間來幫助我學中文。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '好' (good) is used instead of '支持' (supportive).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '她是一個非常支持我的好朋友' (She is a very supportive friend of mine).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of learning Chinese, which is an important detail in the original text.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still working in that cram school teaching English?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
是，我還在那工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
And is this colleague still work with you in the cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她也還在那工作，但我們現在不是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們現在不是搭檔了' instead of '但我們不是搭檔了現在'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have ugh ……any witness you want to subpoena, or any evidence you want to ins …investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
Ugh I hope to subpoena …the co …ugh the defendant’s co-worker to come to the court, which is ugh …the Rong-Er Huang, ugh …works, works in the cram school 美而美 to come here to explain her relationship with the defendant and also explain those messages, what is her goal and her background to send these messages.

Does the accuser have any further evidence want the court to investigate on your behalf?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'further' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I’ve heard that …ugh the cram school have taken some actions toward my husband and his co-worker’s relationship. I think the cram school has convinced Rong-Er Huang to …ugh …resign for his job. So I …I’ve wondered …ugh wondered if the cram school could …ugh …could prove this.
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of important details in the translation

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
Does the defendant ugh …want …have any evidence you want the court to investigate on your behalf?Ugh …the current situation is that your master degree …ugh ……may be end in …ugh 2017, May, May, 2017 already. So there is no excuse for you to still sending message with this Rong-Er Huan. And ……ugh even in after …after 9 in the midnight, which is really suspective.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are her for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The accuser, Yu Han Wang, is filing this case because she suspected her husband, Edward Takayashi, is having an affair with his colleague in the cram school he worked at. The accuser found some intimate messages in the defendant’s phone. And the defendant always found reasons to work late. Moreover, the defendant has been seen go out with his colleague, Ron Er Huang, for multiple times. Therefore, the accuser suspected that the defendant was having an affair.The defendant, your wife is suing you for adultery. What’s your plea?

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Well, do you have your wedding in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Then, over the past few years, does he keep teaching Portuguese as a job in Taiwan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Has he been teaching Portuguese as a job in Taiwan over the past few years?'

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he’s a Portuguese teacher. After we were married, he still kept teaching Portuguese.However, Portuguese is not a popular language for Taiwanese to learn. So, his teaching hours were always unstable. There would even be a one or two-month periods between jobs. Therefore, in order to get a more steady income, he decided to teach English.However, English is not his mother tongue. So, he went to seek an advance degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'When we first met, he’s a Portuguese teacher.' It should be 'When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'After we were married, he still kept teaching Portuguese.' It should be 'After we got married, he still kept teaching Portuguese.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'kept teaching Portuguese' should be translated as 'continued teaching Portuguese' to convey the correct meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that Portuguese is not a popular language for Taiwanese to learn.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that his teaching hours were unstable and there were periods of no classes for one or two months.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that he decided to teach English in order to have a more steady income.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'So, his teaching hours were always unstable.' It should be 'So, his teaching hours have always been unstable.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that he went to seek an advanced degree in English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that he decided to seek an advance degree. Do you mean earning a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advance degree' instead of 'further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, the degree he has to acquire is TESOL.He went online and found a distance learning program from California, United States. So, he got to stay at home and did the distance learning instead of going abroad.This way, he can earn enough credits to get a master’s degree so that he can get a job of English teaching in Taiwan with this degree from the States.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '關於英語教學的' as 'TESOL', which is a specific degree in English language teaching, but not an exact translation of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '遠距教學課程' (distance learning program) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the information about '函授的方式' (correspondence method) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user skipped the mention of '完成課程的要求' (fulfilling course requirements) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the part about '在完成所有的學分之後' (after completing all the credits) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the information about '取得碩士學位' (obtaining a master's degree) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '透過這樣子的一個美國學位' (through such a degree from the United States) in their translation.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Well, what’s the relationship between him and the person he’s having an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues from the cram school. The cram school will arrange a Chinese teacher to partner with an English teacher. That woman is his partner in the cram school.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'partner' does not accurately convey the meaning of '同事' (colleague).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'That woman is his partner in the cram school' is incorrect. It should be 'That woman is his colleague in the cram school.'

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you find out their affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？' as 'How did you find out their affair?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The word 'affair' in English refers to a romantic or sexual relationship outside of marriage, whereas the original text does not specify the nature of the relationship.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I only suspected of working late in the cram school too often. I asked him, “It’s just an English cram school, what’s there to stay late for?” He told me that because of partnering, he had to communicate a lot with his partner.At first, I didn’t really suspect him of having an affair. However, when he got back home from work, he would always get some calls. And he would not answer the calls in front of me. He would even go to the study room to answer the phone. So, I checked his phone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is the wife of the person being talked about.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'suspected' instead of 'suspect' in the sentence 'At first, I only suspected of working late in the cram school too often.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker asked the person being talked about about the reason for working late in the cram school.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the past tense 'suspected' instead of the present tense 'suspect' in the sentence 'At first, I didn’t really suspect him of having an affair.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker checked the person's phone because of the suspicion.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything unusual in the phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, the same number always appeared. So, I went to check his text messages. After I checked, I found out that he’s been texting with the same person every day.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the person the subject is texting with is a woman.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Well, it’s just texting. Are the texts juicy?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation of 'juicy' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it’s just regular texting, it’s fine. However, he is a married man. Why would somebody texting some intimate messages. I submitted some of the messages before, so they should be in the investigatory files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Show exhibit number one. Check the page thirteen. Defendant, are these the text messages in your phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些是我手機裡的訊息。

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I’m going to ask you some questions regarding these messages.The first one was sent at 9:50 PM, December 21st 2017. The number is 0958932123. The text messages said, “我非常想你。” What does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
呃嗯…是一個同事發給我的。我記得我那時請假了兩天，所以他可能有點擔心我吧，所以才發了這封訊息。我的同事是在美國接受教育的，所以他的思想非常開放，他說話就是那個樣子，至於為什麼會說「我的愛」，這是因為這是我們稱呼我們在乎的人的方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that because this colleague is educated in the U.S., her thoughts are pretty westernized. So, “my love” does not mean anything, is that right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the meaning of 'my love' in the context of the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對的，「我的愛」只是用來稱呼那些很好的朋友或是在乎的人，沒什麼特別的。
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user incorrectly translates the phrase '我的愛' as 'good friends' or 'people who care a lot for each other', which does not accurately convey the cultural meaning of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the phrase before that?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，他只是擔心我而已。我們是工作上的共事夥伴，因此我請了兩天假，他自然而然會想念我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們是工作上的共事夥伴' instead of '他只是擔心我而已'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation '他只是擔心我而已' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'she was worried about me'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker was away for two days.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
What your saying is that just because you took two days off, she missed you without your help at work, she texted you “I miss you.” Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對的，訊息就只是這樣而已，並沒有什麼大不了的。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'big' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, let’s move on to the next message. Text message number 2 was sent at 11:55 PM, December 29th 2017. It was sent by the same person. The message says “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” So, what does this message mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他之所以傳給我這封簡訊是為了教我如何用中文表達。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. In Chinese, the subject usually comes before the verb, so it should be '他傳給我' instead of '他之所以傳給我'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. '他之所以傳給我這封簡訊' means 'The reason he sent me this message', but the user's translation says 'He sent me this message'.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You’re saying that the reason that this person texted you this message is to help you with your homework. What does that even mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我老婆剛剛有提到的，我正在就讀一個碩士學程。我必須要拿到三十學分，所以自然而然的有一些功課跟練習需要操作。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you please first explain what you’re studying in your master’s degree?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學程主要為英語教學。在這學程裡當然要學英語教學能力，還有一些文化溝通課程和語文能力的學程。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '學程' instead of '課程'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'TESOL' is translated as '碩士學程' instead of 'TESOL'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我的碩士學程主要為英語教學'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that some courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
You’re trying to earn a master’s degree in TESOL. But there are some cultural communication courses in it, is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'trying' in the translation.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少有三個課程是跟文化溝通有官。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '官' should be '關'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So, what are the assignments for this so-called cultural communication courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'kind' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'what' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'are'.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通的課程對於每個學生來說都不太一樣。以我來說的話，因為我想在台灣找一個教職工作，所以我必須展現我的教學能力及中文上的溝通能力進以達成我的目標。所以，我很多的作業是中英文章的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '以我來說的話' instead of '以我來說話的'. 
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '因為我想在台灣找一個教職工作' is translated as 'because I want to find a teaching position in Taiwan', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '因為我想在台灣找一個教職工作' which means 'because I want to find a teaching job in Taiwan'. 
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the assignments are for the culture and communication courses. 
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the assignments are about Chinese-English sentence translation. 

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Because you have to prove that you have the competence to teach in Taiwan, you have to learn Chinese. And a lot of the assignments are about translation. Is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of completing assignments as part of the course.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'have' instead of 'has' in the sentence.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，而當然我也被要求須要加強我的口說、寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '而當然我也被要求加強我的口說、寫作能力。'

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s get back to the text message. You said that’s your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對的，我還記得那條訊息。你也知道的，有些中文字，對於外國人來說，是很難理解的，所以當我接到這個作業後，我就傳訊息給我那位同事，要他傳答案給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'translate' is translated as '傳答案' which means 'send the answer' instead of '翻譯'.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The idiomatic expression '傳答案' is not adapted to the target language and does not convey the intended meaning.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You typed in Chinese and ask your colleague to type in English and text back to you. This text message is just a product of an assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
是的，那封簡訊只是我作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'homework' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Okay. Let’s show the investigatory records again. From page 14 to page 16, look at all the text messages. Are these all your assignments?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking help from the other person in the original text.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對的，這些訊息的目的都只是為了完成我的作業而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'purpose' as '目的' which means 'goal' instead of '意圖' which means 'intention'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb '只是' ('only') after the verb '完成' ('complete') instead of before it.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation on your wife accusing you of having an affair with your colleague?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
在這件事上，我覺得我太太只是想太多了。我知道我可能無法滿足他對於這個家庭的期望，但在我開始這學位的時候，我太太並沒有展現他的任何支持。他一點都不願意幫助我來完成我的學程，如果他一開始多支持我一點的話，我也根本就不用去問我的搭檔了。所以我覺得，對於這整場誤會，他最該怪的是他自己。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the wife is 'thinking too much' instead of 'thinking highly' of the matter.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the sentence '我覺得我太太只是想太多了', where the subject and verb are reversed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the husband asked his colleague for help, which is mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation leaves out the context that the husband is blaming his wife for the misunderstanding.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
Based on your testimonies, there’s something unhappy going on between you and your wife, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們婚姻剛開始的時候的確是蠻快樂的。但後來主要的問題就是我的工作，因為在台灣，教葡萄牙語實在無法獲得穩定的薪水跟工作時間。所以我們就越來越疏遠了，我沒辦法讓他明白我的挫折感，我也不知道要怎麼與他溝通。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們婚姻剛開始的時候的確是蠻快樂的' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們的婚姻剛開始的時候的確是蠻快樂的'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '教葡萄牙語實在無法獲得穩定的薪水跟工作時間' is mistranslated as 'could not get stable teaching hours.' The correct translation should be 'could not obtain stable salary and working hours.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the job became an issue between the couple and they fought over it. The correct translation should include this detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the frustration and difficult situation faced by the speaker. The correct translation should include this information.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay. Let’s get back to your master degree. When does your master degree start? Does it end? Did you get your degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年的秋天開始這個課程的，這是一個兩年的課程，所以我理應該可以在2017年的五月拿到這個學位。但是，我後來並沒有完成，因為我還有兼職的工作，所以我沒有時間做完所有的作業。就像我說的，我太太從一開始就不支持我。所以，我就像是獨自一人在進攻這個學位，到了後來我已經太累，也充滿了挫折感。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我是在2015年的秋天開始這個課程的'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '所以我理應該可以在2017年的五月拿到這個學位'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我後來並沒有完成'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Incorrect pronoun usage in the sentence '因為我還有兼職的工作，所以我沒有時間做完所有的作業'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '我後來並沒有完成，因為我還有兼職的工作，所以我沒有時間做完所有的作業'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence '我就像是獨自一人在進攻這個學位'.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in the sentence '我太太從一開始就不支持我'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
This course is a two-year course, but you did not finish. Why?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for not finishing the course.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我無法完成所有的課程作業。也無法完成一些課程的需求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not being able to finish the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When is the last semester of your registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊在學的最後一個學期是2017年的春天。

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, your registration should end on May 2017. So, why are you still texting your colleague long after seven months of the end of your registration? There should be no assignments left, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '課程結束後七個月' as 'long after seven months of the end of your registration' instead of 'seven months after the end of the course'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'long after seven months of the end of your registration' in the wrong position in the sentence.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
呃，就算我沒有通過這個學程，我還是想要繼續學中文呀。所以我還是繼續自己跟同事傳簡訊來學習、增強我的中文能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
What you’re is that even though you did not finish the master’s degree program, you still want to keep on learning Chinese in order to be more fluent on Chinese, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'What you mean is that...' instead of 'What you’re is that...'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'even though you did not finish the master’s degree program' does not accurately convey the meaning of '儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程'. A more accurate translation would be 'despite not completing the master's degree program'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of 'continuous learning' in the original text.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
沒錯，所以我才尋求我同事的幫助。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
The role your colleague is serving is kind of like your tutor, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'home tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只像是我的家教，也是一個真正的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
並沒有，我曾有提過要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾有提過要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why would she, in the middle of the night, way past sleeping hours, still text to help you? Isn’t this relationship beyond co-worker’s relationships?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說，他是一個很支持我的朋友。他犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學中文！
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'she' as '他' (he) instead of '她' (she).
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used '他' (he) instead of '她' (she), resulting in subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'using her own time' in the translation.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still working in that cram school to teach English?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'working' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
對的，我仍在那裏工作。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does this colleague still work at that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Does this colleague still work at that cram school?'

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
對的，他也仍在這間補習班工作，但我們不再是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們不再是搭檔了' instead of '但不再是我們搭檔了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have anyone that you need to summon further to examine?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to summon this colleague from Mei Err Mei Cram School, Ron Err Huang, so that she can state this case as a witness and explain those text messages and the background reasons of sending those messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's colleague's name and referred to her as 'this colleague' instead.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'state' instead of 'testify' in the sentence 'so that she can state this case as a witness'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '證人' (witness) as 'colleague' instead of 'witness'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the purpose of summoning the colleague as a witness, which is to explain the relationship between the defendant and the colleague and the background and purpose of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you need this court to summon anyone to investigate further on?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of any specific evidence or information that the accuser wants the court to investigate further.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school did take some actions on the relationships between those two. And they even asked that woman to quit this job. So I was wondering that if we can confirm this matter from the cram school.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '補習班' as 'cram school' instead of '美而美補習班'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '該女黃蓉兒' in the translation.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any other further evidences that you want this court to investigate for you?The situation now is that your master degree program already ended on May 2017. You really don’t have the rightful reasons to send these messages and you cannot use assignments as an excuse to justify your relationship with your colleague. It really is suspicious. Do you have any evidences that can help you with this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The defendant, do you have any other further evidences that you want this court to investigate for you?' is incorrect. It should be 'Do you, the defendant, have any other further evidences that you want this court to investigate for you?'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'evidences' should be 'evidence' in the sentence 'Do you have any other further evidences that you want this court to investigate for you?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'you cannot use assignments as an excuse to justify your relationship with your colleague' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text '尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇'. It should be translated as 'especially since most of your text interactions with Huang Rong'er occur after 9 o'clock in the evening, which raises suspicions'.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我並沒有任何需要庭上幫我調查的證據。就像我之前說的，我跟我同事的關係非常簡單，我只是想增強我的中文能力而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '就像我之前說的' (just like I said before) at the beginning of the sentence, which disrupts the natural word order in Chinese.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next procedure of this case is set at 4:30 PM, on June 24th 2018. We will move on the cross-examination process. Both parties have the right to a lawyer. Do both parties understand? And the accuser and the defendant have to be here.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long have you married with your husband? Do you have an do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'have you married'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question asks if they have children, but the translation omits this part.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years and we do not have children.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Are you married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other four years ago. At that time, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they met in Taiwan and that the user's husband wanted to teach Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past years, is his job to teach Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When I just married when we just married, he was a Portuguese teacher  and he kept teaching Portguese after we married. However, the however Portuguese is not a dominant language in Taiwan, so my husband teaching hour is not certainty. Thus, it’s always period between jobs. So, in order to make a fixed salary, he wants to teach English, but English is not his major language, so he wants to seek an advanced agree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'When I just married when we just married'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'kept teaching Portguese after we married' should be 'continued teaching Portuguese after we got married'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband's teaching hours were unstable and sometimes there were gaps of one or two months without classes.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband wanted to seek an advanced degree in English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mention seek an avanced agree. Does it means that getting a degree in Taiwan.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advanced degree' instead of 'further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he wanted to teach English,  so the degree he got need to be related to English teaching. He found a distance learnig program provided by California in USA so that he can complete the course the requirements through online learning. After he complete the course required, he will got he will get a bachelor degree he will get a US bachelor degree which can help him teach English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'After he complete the course required, he will got he will get a US bachelor degree which can help him teach English in Taiwan.' The correct word order should be 'After he completes the required course, he will get a US bachelor's degree, which can help him teach English in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the degree the person is seeking is a master's degree, not a bachelor's degree.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So, what is the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'husband' in the translation.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in a cram school. The cram school provided the course taught by foreign teacher and Taiwanese teacher. So, the woman is the Chinese teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation incorrectly states that the woman is the Chinese teacher, when the original text refers to her as the 中師 (Chinese teacher).

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How do you know' instead of 'How do you know that'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At the beginning, I just think that that why did he always work overtime in the cram school. He said because of the because he needs to partner with the Chinese teacher, so he will need to have some communication with his partner, but I still think that it’s just a cram school, why do you still need to work overtime? At the beginning, I don’t doubt him. But, afterwards, he always getting his phone calls in the study room. In other words, he tried to avoid making me see her him talking with others, so I checked the phone books so I checked his phone.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'that that why did he always work overtime in the cram school.'

grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence: 'so I checked the phone books so I checked his phone.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the translation.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So, what do you found in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
After check his phone books, I find there is a phone number which he always called. Furthermore, I went to check his text message and I found he always has text messages with a woman.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is communicating with a specific woman.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Text message seems to be a not seriors problem. Is the content of the text message not appropriate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
But it is not ordinary messages. My husband is a married man. Why did allow a woman to send him some intimate messages. I have provided those messages to the court. I think they are now in the files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了' as 'But it is not ordinary messages.' The correct translation is 'If it were just ordinary messages.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user incorrectly translated '怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢' as 'Why did allow a woman to send him some intimate messages.' The correct translation is 'How could he let the other person send such intimate words.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court in the translation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Exibit 1 in page thirty one in page thirteen. The defendant, please check if these messages is from your cell phone?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '提示' as 'Exibit' instead of 'Exhibit'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'in page thirteen' after 'in page thirty one', which is incorrect. It should be 'in page thirteen in page thirty one'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word '裡面' which means 'inside'. The correct translation should be 'Exhibit 1 inside page thirty one in page thirteen'.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這就是我手機上的簡訊。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I need to now I want to ask you some questions about the message. First, that text message is sent at twenty first fifty, on twenty first in December in 2017. The phone number is 2958 0958932123. The content of the message is that I miss you so much. What’s that means what does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I really miss you, my love' as 'I miss you so much'.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封簡訊是來自於我的同事。那一次我請了兩天假，所以她覺得非常擔心，才寄了這樣的一封簡訊給我。我這位同事是在美國受教育的，所以她的所以她表達方式比較開放，這就是他們表達愛的一種方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural expression

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So, do you mean that your colleague is educated in US, so her so her expression is more open. The expression my love is not special, right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of '我的愛' as a simple expression of endearment, when it actually carries a deeper meaning in Chinese culture.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對，這不是一個太奇怪的方式。這就是朋友之間的表達方式。這就是好朋友之間或非常在乎對方的人之間的表達方式。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
So, what about the the last sentence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'last' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，我同事只是很擔心我，因為我請假了兩天。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the colleague was only worried because the user took two days off, rather than naturally missing the user.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So, do you mean that the text message so do you mean that the message texted by her is just because that you leave away for two days and she missed you for accompanying you to teaching?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，這就是我想表達的。我認為那封簡訊真的不是個大問題。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Exibit 2, the text message is sent at twenty third fifty five, on twenty ninth in December in 2017. The phone number is the same as the above. The content is that I want to by my side I want to by your side, and what can we truly be together?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'I want you by my side' as 'I want to by my side'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in 'I want to by your side'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'when' in 'when can we be truly together?'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這封簡訊是想問我這些英文句子在中文裡面應該怎麼表達。 這只是個工作。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You are mean that so do you mean that she roll this message to help you compete your assignment? What does that means?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'roll' as 'send'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'so do you mean that she roll this message'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'to' in 'help you compete your assignment'

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太說的，我正在爭取一個碩士學位而且我必須要完成30學分。所以很正常所以很正常地，我必須會有一些工作我必須會有一些作業要做。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about completing assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Uh so please explain that what do you actually study to achieve your master degree.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是英語教學，這裡面一部分包含了英語教學， 另一部分包含語言能力及文化。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' instead of '計畫'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我的課程是英語教學，其中一部分與英語教學有關，另一部分與文化和語言能力有關。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the program being TESOL. It should be '我的課程是TESOL的英語教學計畫，其中一部分與英語教學有關，另一部分與文化和語言能力有關。'

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So, you mean that you will get a degree of TESOL, but the course also includes some culture communication?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the degree being a TESOL degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the course including culture communication.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，如果沒記錯的話，有三門課是跟文化溝通有關係的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what does the assignment which is related to this kind of course?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這樣的文化或是溝通的課程是將會因人而異。拿我自己當例子好了，我想要得到英語教學的學位，所以我必須要證明自己對於中文有一定的了解。所以我的作業當中有很多是關於中英對譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'good command of Chinese' as '一定的了解', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'good command'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'prove my competence' in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'Chinese-English sentence translation' as '中英對譯', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'sentence translation'.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean that you wanted to getting a teaching position in Taiwan, so the course require you to have the understanding of Chinese, so many assignments related to your course is translation between Chinese and English. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of completing assignments as part of the course.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的沒錯。此外我還被要求要精進我的口說跟寫作寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, let’s get back to the point. The message we just mentioned is your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，當我收到作業上的那兩那幾句中文時，我不知道要如何翻譯他們，法官也知道的，中文字有的時候對於外國人來說難以辨識，所所以我就向我的同事求助並請她將答案寄給我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The translation does not adapt the idiomatic expression 'difficult for foreigners to recognize' to the target language.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So, the situation is that you ask the your colleague the translation of the Chinese sentence and ask her to send the answer to you through text message, so the message is just a part of your assignment.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about asking the colleague to send the answer through text message.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'ask' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
是的，那封簡訊就只是我作業的一部分而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'answer' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
The defendant, please see the evidence show on Page No.14 to page 16. These message are all for your assignments, right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages on pages 14 to 16.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些所有這所有的簡訊都是為了完成作業而存在的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, regard so concerning that your wife think that you have an affair with your colleague, what’s your explanation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
關於這件事，我覺得我的太太真的想得太多了。我知道她對於我沒有對這個家提供我知道她一直在意我沒有對這個家提供資助，但我想讓法官知道的是，從我開始這段課程，我的太太也沒有提供我任何支持。因為在我想要取得學位這件事上，我太太的我太太的態度一直不是那麼的支持，如果她可以表示出支持的話，我就不需要去找我的同事尋求協助了阿!所以我覺得她應該為這整件誤解負一些責任。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '資助' (financial support) is not an accurate translation for 'support' in this context.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '對這個家提供' (provide for this family) is not an accurate translation for 'support the family' in this context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '因為在我想要取得學位這件事上，我的太太的我太太的態度一直不是那麼的支持' is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the speaker asked their colleague for help.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
So, it seems that you are not satisfied with your relationships?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the sentence.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們的婚姻一開始，我們也曾經過得很幸福。但是一切的問題都來自於我的工作，我無法在教授葡萄牙語上得到穩定的授課時數。這件事，關於我的工作這件事，是造成我們不愉快的最大原因，而我們也已經因為這件事起了很多衝突，我的太太不相信我已經在工作這件事上做了最大的努力，我不知道如何讓他了解我的挫折和我面對的處境。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '在我們的婚姻一開始' should be '一開始，在我們的婚姻'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '一切的問題都來自於我的工作' is translated as 'All the problems come from my work', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'The problem is my employment'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the speaker tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Uh, back to your master degree, when did the course begin and do you complete your course and get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年4月開始的這個課程，這個課程需要兩年的時間完成，理論上我應該在2017年5月得到取得碩士學位，但因為我一直有做一些兼職，所以沒有足夠的時間念書，最後也就沒有得到這個學位。正如我所說，在我追求學位的這件事上，我的太太並沒有展現出她的支持，我覺得我是一個人孤軍奮戰在取得在追求這個學位，這讓我覺得很沮喪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我是在2015年4月開始的這個課程' is incorrect. It should be '我是在2015年秋季開始這個課程'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense in the sentence '理論上我應該在2017年5月得到取得碩士學位' is incorrect. It should be '理論上我應該在2017年5月完成碩士學位'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '最後也就沒有得到這個學位' is incorrect. It should be '最後我沒有得到這個學位'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '正如我所說，在我追求學位的這件事上，我的太太並沒有展現出她的支持' is incorrect. It should be '正如我所說，在我追求學位的這件事上，我的太太並沒有給予我足夠的支持'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我覺得我是一個人孤軍奮戰在取得在追求這個學位' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself.'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So, you say that the whole program last for two years and you don’t complete the course and get the degree, why?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒有辦法完成所有的作業一些還有一些課程的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'couldn't' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
What is the end of your registered period?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊的最後一學期是在2017年的春天。

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you mentioned above, your course may your course is supposed to was supposed to end in May in 2017, so you are supposed to not have the assignment at all, but you still have text message with your colleague after seven month of your expiration.
omission or addition	omitting important details	omitting the information about the course ending in May 2017
grammar and structure	tense errors	using 'may' instead of 'was supposed to'

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然我最後沒有取得學位，但這不代表我就放棄精進我的中文了，所以在課程結束後，我仍持續地靠自學進修我的中文。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of failing the program in their translation.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even though you didn’t complete your degree, you still want to keep improving your Chinese competence. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是為什麼我持續尋求我同事的協助。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, the role of your colleague is like a personal teacher?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
對我而言，她不只是個家教，而是我真正的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
So, do you pay her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有耶，不過我曾經有說過要付她報酬，但她婉拒了我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不過我曾經有說過要付她報酬，但她婉拒了我。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
So, if you didn’t pay her, why does your colleague sending you answer in the midnight, which is a sleeping time of her? I think the situation is beyond the coworker’s relationship.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我說她是我真正的好朋友啊!在我學習中文這件事情，她一直表示著為最大的支持。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '我真正的好朋友' does not directly translate to 'very supportive friend'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order. The phrase '在我學習中文這件事情' should be placed before '她一直表示著為最大的支持'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那裡工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
So that colleague so is that colleague still work there still working there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，她也還在那裡工作，但我們不再是彼此的搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們不再是彼此的搭檔了' instead of '但我們不再是搭檔彼此了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any person that you want to subpoena or any evidence that need the court to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena the defendant’s colleague Huang Ron-Er to serve as a witness. I hope that she can explain her relation with the defendant.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the details about the text messages and their purpose.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The defendant, do you have any evidence that need the court to investigate for you
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff as the one who needs to provide evidence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'defendant' instead of 'plaintiff' as the subject of the sentence.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I hope that the court can subpoena the cram school 美而美. Uh, I hope that the court will inquire the cram school 美而美 about the whole situation. I heard that the cram school once took some actions to deal with this situation and they even wanted to persuade the woman to leave.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the relationship between the two people involved.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' before the object 'the cram school', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of wanting to inquire about the situation.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence that need the court to help you with your case? The current situation is that your master degree course ended in May in 2017, so that’s not an explanation that can help you clarify your relationship between you and Huang Ron-Er. So, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The defendant, do you have any evidence that need the court to help you with your case?' is incorrect. It should be 'Do you, the defendant, have any evidence that needs the court's help with your case?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'The current situation is that your master degree course ended in May in 2017' does not accurately convey the original meaning. It should be 'The current situation is that your master's degree program ended in May 2017.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant's text message interaction with Huang Ron-Er, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant's text message interaction with Huang Ron-Er, which is an important detail in the original text.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我實在是沒有任何證據可以代表我，就像我說的，我們之間的關係很簡單，就只是我想要持續進修英文，而我的同事提供我協助，就這樣而已。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我實在是沒有任何證據可以代表我'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original sentence 'I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf' is not accurately conveyed in the translation. The translation suggests that the speaker doesn't have any evidence to represent themselves, while the original sentence implies that the court cannot investigate any evidence on the speaker's behalf.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail that the purpose of the communication between the speaker and their colleague was to improve their language ability and continue learning Chinese.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the procedure of inquiry of the witness is set to be at four thirty PM on twenty forth in June in 2018. Both of the parties need to attend the procedure attend the court. Both of you can hire a lawyer.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the need for both parties to attend the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the possibility for both parties to hire a lawyer.

 我明白。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
We’ re here today for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The accuser filed the case because her husband had an affair with his coworker, and it’s beyond co-workers’ relationship. The accuser found some intimate messages in her husband phone. Her husband often made up reasons for extra hours working, also he would found up reason for doing tele-conferencing with his co-worker Rong-Er Huang. The defendant, your wife accused you had an adultery case, what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'We’ re here today for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'The accuser filed the case because her husband had an affair with his coworker, and it’s beyond co-workers’ relationship.' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the husband had an affair with his coworker, while the translation suggests that the affair is beyond a coworker relationship.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of the accuser finding intimate messages in her husband's phone.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The translation includes the phrase 'also he would found up reason for doing tele-conferencing with his co-worker Rong-Er Huang.' which is not present in the original text.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation uses the term 'adultery case' which may not accurately convey the legal term '通姦罪' in the original text.

Not guilty, of course.
我無罪
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, we will ask the details of text messages of the defendant to confirm if the adultery case existed. Does both parties understand the procedure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Does both parties understand the procedure?' instead of 'Does both parties understand the procedure?'

我明白
I understand.

I understand.
我了解

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long have you been married to your husband? Do you have a child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for 4 years, and we don’t have kids.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Did you marry in Taiwan, or in other country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband 4 years ago. He first came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'He came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.'

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Well, over the past few years, his job in Taiwan is just teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense 'was' to match the time frame mentioned.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he still teaches Portuguese. However, there aren’t many people in Taiwan want to learn Portuguese so his teaching hours is not stable. Sometimes, there is a period between jobs, even for two months. In order to increase the income he decided to teach English. However, his native language is not English so he decided to seek an advance degree in English.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Sometimes, there is a period between jobs, even for two months' is incorrect. It should be 'Sometimes, there is a period, even for two months, between jobs.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband wanted to seek an advanced degree in English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he decided to seek an advance degree. Does it mean that he wanted to seek a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advance degree' instead of 'further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wanted to teach English, he wanted to get a degree of TESOL. He found a online platform about distance learning program provided by California, so he doesn’t have to go to America to get that degree. After finish all the classes, he can get a master degree. Then, he can get a English teaching job in Taiwan.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user incorrectly translated '關於英語教學' as 'TESOL' instead of 'about English teaching'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '遠距教學課程' as 'distance learning program' instead of 'online platform'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the program being offered by a university in California.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the program being completed through correspondence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the degree being a master's degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the degree being related to English teaching.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the degree being obtained after completing all the credits.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the purpose of getting the degree to find an English teaching job in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what’s the relationship between him and the person he has adultery?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
There are coworkers in the cram school. In that cram school, they have foreign teachers and Chinese teachers. They partner up to teach the classes, so the lady is his partner.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '同事' as 'coworkers' instead of 'classmates'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the cram school arranges for Chinese and foreign teachers to teach together.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the lady is the user's partner in the class.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'affair' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At the beginning, I found that he often worked over hours at the cram school. I asked him why he had to spend so much time at the cram school. It’s not necessary. He said that because he had to partner up with Taiwanese teacher. He had to communicate with her. At first, I didn’t doubt that he has an affair. However, sometimes after he came home, he often had a phone call. He didn’t answer the phone in front of me. Instead, he went to the study room to answer the phone. After I checked his phone, I found that there are some messages.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'cram school' as 'cram school' instead of 'English language school'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the husband's explanation for working late at the cram school
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the wife's suspicion and subsequent action of checking the husband's phone
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'He didn’t answer the phone in front of me'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the content of the messages found on the husband's phone

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything unusual in his phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
First, I found that there is always a same number in his phone record. Then, I checked his messages. I found that he kept texting with the same lady, and they have messages everyday.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is a male.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverb 'always' before the verb 'kept', which is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the user's curiosity was the reason for checking the messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even if they are messaging, that’s not a big deal. Is the context inappropriate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it just a normal message, why did she kept texting to the man who is married. I found some intimate messages. It should be in the file that I provided to the court before.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '讓對方發一些很親密的字句' as 'kept texting intimate messages' instead of 'letting the other party send some intimate words'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court in the translation

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
As you can see in the file, there are some messages in the file. I want to ask the defendant. Is that the messages in your cellphone?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的這是我手機裡的訊息
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then, I want to ask some questions about these messages.The first message is sent from the phone number 0958932123, at 9:50 pm, on Dec 21st, 2017. The message is : “ I really miss you, my love.” What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封簡訊是我同事傳的，那時我請假兩天，所以她只是傳簡訊來關心我一下。我的同事是在美國受教育的。他的思想非常開放，至於my love 這個字只是用來表達我們在乎的人而已。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So the person is educated in the U.S. Her mind is westernized, and she openly expresses her emotion, so the word “my love” is not a big deal. Is that right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of '我的愛' as simply meaning 'my love' without any special meaning.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
是的，那個只是我們彼此之間稱呼在乎的朋友的方式
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the former part of the message?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
正如我所說的，他只是很擔心我而已，在我請假兩天時，他非常的擔心，畢竟我們是工作上的搭擋。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So did you mean that because you were away for two days, and without your assistance, she just missed you, so she sent the message to worry about you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea of 'worrying' about the speaker.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，那封簡訊真的沒有什麼
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'The message was no big deal,' the user's translation says 'That text message really didn't have anything.'

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Then, the second message also sent from the same number, at 11:55 pm, Dec 29th, 2017. The content is “ I want you by my side, when can we be truly together? What does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他寫那個句子是為了幫助我寫中文作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You meant that the purpose that the message to help you to do the homework. What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
正如我太太先前提過的，我為了要拿到我的學位，我必須完成30學分的課程，還有一些作業及習題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '提過的' should come after the subject '我'.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you please explain what is your master degree about?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程主要是英語教學，那個課程涵蓋英語教學，以及文化和語言能力。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' instead of '計畫' or '方案'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我的課程主要是英語教學，那個課程涵蓋英語教學，以及文化和語言能力。'

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you get a degree of TESOL, and there are some culture and communication courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'some' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the word 'communication' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation lacks the appropriate level of formality and politeness that is present in the original text.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的我記得有三門課程是與語言文化有關
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What are the assignments of the course Culture and Communication?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'kind' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
在這門課的作業是因人而異的。以我來說，我為了要在台灣取得英語教學工作，我必須要有能力用當地語言溝通。所以我很多作業都是中英翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '以我來說，我為了在台灣取得英語教學工作，必須要有能力用當地語言溝通。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '取得英語教學工作' is translated as 'seek a teaching position as an English teacher', which does not accurately convey the meaning. The correct translation should be 'obtain a teaching position in English'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the assignments are for the 'culture and communication courses'.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
In order to get the English teaching degree, you have to finish some assignments about Chinese-English translation. Is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific course, which is important for understanding the context.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'have' instead of 'has' to agree with the singular subject 'degree'.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，我還需要精進我的口說與寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Then….Let’s go back to the sentence we just said. Is that your assignment
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，那是我的作業，當時我看到這個句子我不知道該怎麼翻譯。你也知道，中文字對外國人來說是很困難的，所以我就問我的同事，並請她傳訊息告訴我答案。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not adapt the idiomatic expression 'Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize' to the target language.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you meant… because you asked some questions about Chinese, your colleague sent you this message. This is just about the assignment. Is that what you meant?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Please see the evidence 1, page 14-16. These messages are all your assignment. The person sent you the messages because you need help for your assignments. Is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages on pages 14-16.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation about your wife accused you had an affair with your coworker?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事情真的是想太多了，我知道她很不滿我沒有那麼多能力去支撐整個家庭，但當時我要去進修的時候她完全沒任何支持。因為他一開始就沒有支持我。如果她當時支持我的話，我就不會去找我同事幫忙，她應該怪罪於自己。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'blamed' as '怪罪於自己', which means 'blame oneself' instead of 'blame her'.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your words, it seems that you didn’t get along with your wife.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們剛結婚時，的確相處得非常愉快。主要是我工作的問題，因為教授葡萄牙文的時數並不是很固定。所以這就變成我們之間很大的問題，我們常常為這件事吵架，她並不相信我已經盡力，她並不知道我因這件事非常挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '主要是我工作的問題' (The main problem is my job). The correct word order should be '我工作的問題主要是'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So let’s go back to your master degree. When did you start it? Does it finish? Did you get your degree?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details about the master's degree program, such as the start and end dates.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention whether they obtained the degree or not.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年秋季註冊的，那是兩年的課程，我應該會在2017年的五月完成，但我一直有兼職工作，我沒有時間做作業，所以我沒有完成它。就像我所說的，我的太太並沒有支持我，讓我覺得很孤獨、很累，所以我就沒有拿到學位。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我是在2015年秋季註冊的' (I registered in the fall of 2015). The correct word order should be '我在2015年秋季註冊的'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '我應該會在2017年的五月完成' (I should have finished in May 2017). The correct tense should be '我應該在2017年的五月完成'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我一直有兼職工作' (I have been working part-time). The correct word order should be '我有一直兼職工作'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我沒有時間做作業' (I don't have time to do assignments). The correct word order should be '我沒有時間做作業'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以我就沒有拿到學位' (So I didn't get the degree). The correct word order should be '所以我就沒有拿到學位'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我覺得很孤獨、很累' (I felt lonely and tired) is translated as 'I became too tired and too frustrated', which changes the meaning of the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我的太太並沒有支持我' (My wife didn't support me) is translated as 'my wife has never been very supportive', which changes the meaning of the original text.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You meant that this program is for two years, and you didn’t finish in the end. Why is that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我無法完成所有課程的作業。以及一些課程的要求
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not being able to finish the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When is the last semester you registered?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後註冊的學期是2017年的春學期。

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you mentioned, your program should be finished on 2017 in May. But the messages happened 7 months after the program finished. Why was that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '課程結束後七個月' as '7 months after the program finished' instead of '7 months after the course ended'.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我完成我的學位，這並不代表我不想精進我的語言能力。所以就算我沒有完成我得學位我還是有在自學，精進我的語言能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就算我沒有完成我的學位，這並不代表我不想精進我的語言能力。所以我還是有在自學，精進我的語言能力。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You meant that even you didn’t finish your program. You still want to learn Chinese to improve your Chinese ability. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫忙
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague is just like your tutor. Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是我的家教，還是我的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
不，我曾提出要付她錢，但她拒絕。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾提出要付她錢，但她拒絕。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why would she help you in the midnight? Is that beyond what the coworker has to do?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我會說他是非常支持我的朋友，她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' (he) was used instead of '她' (she).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '她是非常支持我的朋友' (She is a very supportive friend).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of learning Chinese in the translation.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific subject of teaching, which is 'English'.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的我還在那工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does this colleague still work there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，她還在那工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們已經不是搭擋了' instead of '但我們已經不是了搭擋'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any evidence that you want to investigate? Do you want to subpoena someone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, Ron Er Huang. I want her to come to the court to explain the relationship between her and the defendant and explain the content of the messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important details of the colleague's name, which is Huang Rong Er, and the fact that she works at Mei Er Mei Tutorial Center.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error. Instead of saying 'I want her to come to the court,' it should be 'I would like her to come to court.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses 'subpoena' instead of 'summon' to request the colleague's presence in court.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the purpose of the colleague's testimony. It should include the colleague's role as a witness and the background and purpose of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation, which is an important detail.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'the accuser' as the subject, but it should be 'the accuser' instead.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that MeiErMei cram school had tried to deal with their relationship. They even asked their colleague Ron Er Huang to quit the job. I would like to subpoena the officer of the cram school to the court.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '試圖說服' as 'asked' instead of 'tried to deal with'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '採取一些行動' (took some actions) in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情' (I don't know if I can subpoena the cram school) in the translation.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? According to your words, your program should be finished on May 2017. You have no excuse for that, especially the messages were often sent after 9 pm. Do you have any evidence that you can prove that is just for the assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'According to your words, your program should have been finished on May 2017.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '沒有理由以做作業為藉口' as 'You have no excuse for that', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be translated as 'There is no reason to use doing assignments as an excuse'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '黃蓉兒' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '簡訊互動' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我目前有任何想要法院幫忙調查的證據。就像我所說的，我與同事之間的關係非常簡單，我只是想要提升我的中文能力而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'evidence' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '我目前有任何想要法院幫忙調查的' (I currently have any evidence that the court can investigate) at the beginning of the sentence, which is a word order error. The correct word order should be '我目前沒有任何想要法院幫忙調查的證據' (I currently do not have any evidence that the court can investigate).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple' as '我與同事之間的關係非常簡單' (the relationship between my colleague and myself is very simple), which does not convey the intended meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court date will be set on 2018, June 24th, at 4:30 pm. The court will ask some questions to the witnesses. The both parties please make sure to come to the court. If necessary, you can hire a lawyer. Does the both parties understand ?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.
我明白。

今為 刑事庭 審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '準備程序為通譯' which means 'as an interpreter in the preparation process'.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of an adultery case. The accuser Wang Yuhan, she thinks her husband is having an intimate relationship with his co-worker in the company. The accuser found intimate messages in the phone of his husband and his husband always found excuses for working late in the night. And he always has tele-conferencing with his coworker in the night. This situation, she thinks, has beyond coworker’s relationship, therefore she decided to file an adultery case. Defendant, your wife thinks you’ve committed the case of adultery, what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The accuser Wang Yuhan, she thinks her husband is having an intimate relationship with his co-worker in the company.' The correct word order should be 'Wang Yuhan, the accuser, thinks her husband is having an intimate relationship with his co-worker in the company.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'The accuser found intimate messages in the phone of his husband.' The correct sentence should be 'The accuser found intimate messages on her husband's phone.'

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence: 'Defendant, your wife thinks you’ve committed the case of adultery, what’s your plea?'

Not guilty, of course.
我當然沒有罪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, this court will ask the details of the relationship of the defendant and the coworker to decide whether they have committed adultery. Do you fully understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

我明白
I understand.

I understand.
我了解。

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'have you been married'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question does not include the information about having children, which was present in the original text.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve been married for four years, and we do not have kids.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of her husband in the translation.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
So do you get married with your husband in Taiwan or in any other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in past years, is your husband’s main job about teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, he continued as a Portuguese teacher. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so my husband always had an unstable condition in teaching Portuguese, for example, he would have few weeks not teaching Portuguese. Therefore, to make his income stable, however, English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced education.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '一位葡萄牙文老師' as 'a Portuguese teacher' instead of 'a Portuguese language teacher'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'he continued as a Portuguese teacher' instead of 'he continued teaching Portuguese'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband wanted to make his income more stable by teaching English.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that English is not the husband's mother tongue.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband decided to seek an advanced education to teach English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that your husband decided to seek an advanced program in Taiwan, do you mean he wants a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that '進修' means seeking an advanced program for a degree, when it actually means further education or professional development.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wants to take English-teaching as his job, therefore he must have a TESOL certificate. He found online a distance learning program in California, therefore he didn’t have to go to the US. And he can sit at home and receive distance learning and meet the requirements of the program. After he finished all the credits, he would have a postgraduate degree. Therefore, with such a certificate, he can have a job as an English teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '學位' as 'certificate' instead of 'degree'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of TESOL in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of the specific program being a distance learning program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user skipped the mention of the program being from California.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the information about the program being completed through correspondence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of the program being a postgraduate degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the purpose of the degree being to find a job as an English teacher.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So What’s the relationship between he and the partner he is having a relationship with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
The person he is having a relationship with is a co-worker in his class. The teaching school has one Chinese teacher and one foreign teacher for one class. And the woman is the Chinese teacher in his class.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'relationship' is used instead of 'colleague'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'having a relationship with' does not accurately convey the meaning of '同事' (colleague).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that they work in a tutoring center.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not mention that the teaching school arranges for Chinese and foreign teachers to work together.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not specify that the woman is the Chinese teacher in his class.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they are having an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How do you know' instead of 'How do you know they'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, he always worked overtime and didn’t come home. I’m confused that it’s only a teaching school. There’s no reason for him to work overtime. He explains that he had to work with a Chinese teacher, and there’s much to communicate with that Chinese teacher. At first, he didn’t think he is having an affair. But later on, I found he constantly received telephone calls at home. And he didn’t receive those phone calls in front of me. Instead, he goes to the study room to receive those phone calls. So I got a little curious about the intention of him and later I checked his cellphone and found the reason.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	using 'teaching school' instead of 'English language school'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpreting 'communicate with' as 'work with'
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out the suspicion and curiosity of the speaker
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	including irrelevant material about checking the cellphone

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, I found one telephone number constantly showing in his phone book. And therefore, I checked his messages and found that he sent text messages to that number constantly.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'phone book' instead of 'messages'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is communicating with a woman.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
I think it’s ok to send text messages. Is it because the content of the text messages is inappropriate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
They are not sending common text massages. Considering he is a married person, it’s not appropriate to send intimate messages to another woman. I have report to the court the content of the messages. I think they are in the files.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the cultural context

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Exhibit evidence, page 13. Please be noted of the content of the messages. Defendant, please take a look, do you send those messages?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's phone.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的， 這些是我手機上的訊息。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Therefore, I will ask you a few questions about the text messages. The first message is sent by the phone number 0958-932123 at 9:50 pm, on December 21st, 2017. The content is I really miss you, my love, so what’s your explanation?

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
該簡訊的內容由同事傳給我，當時我記得我休假了兩天，她非常擔心，因此發送了這樣的簡訊。我的同事在美國受教育，思想開放，這也是她之所以這樣談話，這樣表達的原因，至於“My love”的部分，這是我們對關心的人的稱呼。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that the sender received her education in the US, and got very westernized and she is very open-minded about stuffs like emotions, and the phrase my love sent by her does not have any special connotations?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
是的，這樣的話是在朋友間，或是在互相關心的人之間的用法。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
So how about the phrase before my love?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'my love' in their translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
正如我之前所述，她非常擔心我，作為我的同事對於我離開兩天非常擔心。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '作為我的同事，她對我離開兩天非常擔心。'

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So do you mean because you take two days off from work, she got very worried about you and sent you messages like she missed you.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea of the person being worried and expressing missing the other person.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，這就是當時的背景情況，那封簡訊沒有什麼大的問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message is sent by the same person at 11:55pm on December 29th, 2017. the content is I really want you be my side, when can we be truly together? So what does this text message mean and what does it exist?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	I really want you be my side
omission or addition	omitting important details	when can we be truly together?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她當時寫這封簡訊是告訴我怎麼樣表達我作業中的用法。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that the sender sent you this message to help you with this message, what does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
正如我妻子所向法庭所述，我當時正在修讀一個碩士課程，需要完成30分的學分，因此也需要完成一些作業和考試。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Please explain what on earth your master program is about?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士課程是英語教學，內容包括英文教學，文化以及語言能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我的碩士課程是英語教學'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the program being a master's degree program.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you mean that there’s something about culture in your English-teaching master program.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少有三門課關於文化與溝通議題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What’s the homework of these culture and communications courses.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'these' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這樣的一門作業每個人都有所不同，就以我為例，因為我在台灣，希望獲得一個英語教學相關的崗位，要達到這樣的目標，我需要提高自己的英語能力，所以要學好中文。因此我的作業很多方面很多都是中英句子的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '每个人都有所不同' instead of '这样的一门作业每个人都有所不同'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'culture and communication courses' in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'English teacher' in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'Chinese-English sentence translation' in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'prove my competence' in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'show that I have a good command of Chinese' in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'reach this goal' in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'many of my assignments' in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'were about Chinese-English sentence translation' in their translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean you want to seek an English teaching position in Taiwan, and in this master program you have to prove yourself the Chinese competency. The coursework includes assignments of translating Chinese and English sentences, am I right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，我同樣被要求提升自己的讀寫能力。

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok, let’s go back to that text massage. Is that your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，因為我當時寫的作業有一些不太理解，因為中文中有些東西外國人很難認， 因此我就請我的同事幫助我來翻譯，然後將答案傳給我。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural references

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you sent the Chinese text message to her and she sent back the Chinese answers to you. Is that your homework?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
OK, defendant please look at the file One, page 14 to 16. Please carefully check the content of the messages. Are those messages all the assignments of you? Is it because it’s your homework and you sent them to her to help you with your assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '偵卷' as 'defendant' instead of 'file'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'OK' at the beginning of the sentence instead of at the end.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '簡訊內容' (message content) in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '對方' (the other person) in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '發給你的' (sent to you) in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '都是你因為要做作業' (all because you were doing homework) in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '尋求對方幫助' (seeking the other person's help) in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '才' (only) in the translation.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊都是同樣的目的，針對我的作業。

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So what’s your explanation in response to your wife’s suit that you have an affair with the third person?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '針對' as 'in response to' instead of 'accusing'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'in response to' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'explanation'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's accusation in the translation.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我的妻子把這件事想得太嚴重了，我知道我持家的能力並不是很好，但她沒在剛開始的時候幫助我啊。因為她一直都沒有幫助我完成我的學位，如果不是這樣，我也不會讓同事幫忙，她應該為此負責，這是誤解的原因。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'blamed' as '負責', which means 'responsible' instead of '責怪', which means 'blame'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'from the very beginning of my study' in the translation.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, it seems that you have some unhappy situations with your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況' as 'you have some unhappy situations with your wife', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛開始相處時，我們彼此都度過了愉快的時光， 但問題就在於我的工作，我剛開始在這裡教葡萄牙語，但並不能獲得穩定的 教學時間。之後工作問題就成了我們之間的問題，我們時而為此吵架，她並不理解我的努力也並不知道我的沮喪和當時的困境。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們彼此都度過了愉快的時光' is incorrect. It should be '我們都彼此度過了愉快的時光'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok, let’s go back to the master program, when does this master program start? Does it end? Did you get your diploma?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這個項目開始於2015年的秋季，應當耗時2年時間，並在2017年5月結束，但是我當時在兼職，我沒有足夠的時間做作業，所以並沒有完成學位。正如我所言，我的妻子在我這個碩士項目上並沒有很幫助我，我覺得我彷彿一個人在追求這個學位，因此非常累也非常沮喪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '這個項目開始於2015年的秋季'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '應當耗時2年時間'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '並在2017年5月結束'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '但是我當時在兼職'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我沒有足夠的時間做作業'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以並沒有完成學位'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '正如我所言'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我的妻子在我這個碩士項目上並沒有很幫助我'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我覺得我彷彿一個人在追求這個學位'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '因此非常累也非常沮喪'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean this is a two-year program, and you failed to finish it, what’s the reason?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成所有的課程作業。也沒辦法完成課堂的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not being able to finish the course requirement.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So when is the end of the last semester registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
最後註冊的學期是2017年春季。

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, the last semester is May 2017, therefore you shouldn’t have assignment from then on. But the text messages last 7 months after the completion of your master program, what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the completion of the master program.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
好吧，儘管我沒有完成自己的碩士項目，但這並不意味著我不能繼續學習中文， 所以結束後，我也是想繼續提升自己的中文能力，所以我繼續一個人努力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我結束後也想繼續提升自己的中文能力，所以我繼續一個人努力。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that although you didn’t complete your master program, you still want to sharpen you Chinese competency, am I right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這也是我讓我同事幫助我的原因。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the role played by your co-worker is like a home teacher, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'home teacher' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
對我來說，她不僅像個家教，更像是個很好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay the tuition to her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我之前說要給她學費，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我之前說要給她學費，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, is it beyond coworker’s relationship that she sent text messages to you to answer your questions at midnight?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
正如我之前所說，她真的在幫助我，利用她的閒餘時間幫我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她真的在幫助我，利用她的閒餘時間幫我學中文。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach at that teaching school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我仍在那裏工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does your coworker still work there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，她也在那裡教學，但我們並沒有組成一個班。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們並沒有組成一個班' instead of '但我們並沒有組成一個班。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any evidence you want to investigate or any witness you want to ask to the court?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
This court wants to subpoena the colleague Huang Rong’er, to explain the relationship between these two and the context as well as the purpose of these text massages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the court wanting to subpoena the colleague Huang Rong'er.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order should be 'to explain the relationship between these two and the context as well as the purpose of these text messages.'

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Accuser, is there anything you want the court to further investigate?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the accuser in their translation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard the teaching school has done something about their relationship. They even talked to the coworker to resign. I want to know if it’s right and I want to further investigate this evidence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '補習班' (teaching school) as 'coworker'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the action taken by the teaching school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
Defendant, is there any evidence you want us to help investigate for you? Considering your master program has already finished on May 2017, you have no reason to keep sending text messages to your coworker Huang Rong’er for assignment. And the conversations start usually at 9 pm. This is really suspicious. Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master program finishing in May 2017, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the suspicious timing of the text messages starting at 9 pm, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'you want us' instead of 'you want the court' in the sentence 'is there any evidence you want us to help investigate for you?'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有任何的證據作為進一步的調查，我和同事之間的短信互動實際上非常簡單，就是我想提升我的語言能力，精進我的中文。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of not being able to think of any evidence that the court can investigate on their behalf.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'communication' as '短信互動' (text message interaction) instead of '交流' (communication).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'language ability' as '語言能力' (language ability) instead of '語言技能' (language skills).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'continue to learn Chinese' as '精進我的中文' (improve my Chinese) instead of '繼續學習中文' (continue learning Chinese).

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next proceeding starts at 4:30 pm on June 24th, 2018. Both the accuser and the defendant shall be present. If required, both parties can have a lawyer, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.

請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
Prosecutor, please state the details of the crime.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'Prosecutor' at the beginning of the sentence, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. Instead of 'Prosecutor, please state the details of the crime.', the user translates it as 'Prosecutor, please state the details of the crime.'

如起訴書所載。
As stated in the indictment.

被告Steven Knox於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在其自家門口 （地址為：新北市板橋區長江路 23號6樓），因其摩托車被挪動而與鄰居（即告訴人）發生口角，進而產生肢體衝突。經告訴人至醫院驗傷，醫師診斷為手臂、身體多處挫傷、瘀青，後被提告。檢察官起訴被告違反刑法375條之傷害罪，被告做何答辯？
The incident happened at 7:50 p.m. on July 18th 2020 in the door of the defendant’s house. Because the defendant’s motorcycle was moved by his neighbor, also the accuser, the defendant had a quarrel with the accuser. Then, in the end, they had physical confrontation. And the defendant’s house is at New Taipei City, Banqiao district, …… is at 4th floor Changjiang Rd., New Taipei City. After the accused went to the hospital, he was injured a lot of bruises and scratches on the back of his hands. Then, the defendant is prosecuted of Clause number 352 in the criminal law. The defendant, what is your plea?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	July 18th 2020 should be translated as 中華民國109年6月18日
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	the defendant's motorcycle was moved by his neighbor should be translated as 因其摩托車被挪動

omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the plea of the defendant

I plead not guilty.
我沒有罪
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'plead' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I plead not guilty.'

今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
Today, we are here for preparatory procedure. We will see the evidence provided. Both the prosecutor and the defendant can ask questions. The defendant did not hire a lawyer, so he will state by himself. The defendant, do you understand the procedure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The defendant, do you understand the procedure?' is incorrect. It should be 'Do you understand the procedure, defendant?'

了解。
Yes, I understand.

請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
The prosecutor, please check and confirm the evidence used in this case and ask questions.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The defendant, at 7:50 p.m. on June 18th 2020 at the door of your house, you had a quarrel with neighborhood, who is also the accuser, and your quarrel came into physical confrontation. In the investigatory record on page 8, there are statements made at the police station. In the statements you made at police station, you said that you went home at 6:30 p.m. at that day. Then you put your motorcycle in the parking slot, and then you went up to the stairs. After you have dinner, you looked down stairs quickly, and you found out there was someone moving your motorcycle. So you go down stairs to check the situation immediately. When you go down the stairs, you found that the one who moved your motorcycle is Damin Chang, the accuser… umm who moved your motorcycle. Then you asked why he move your motorcycle. The accuser said that because your motorcycle stock his way, and you should not stop motorcycle at that place, so he moved your motorcycle. Because you disagree with his statement, so you two have quarrel, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'In the investigatory record on page 8, there are statements made at the police station.' The correct word order should be 'There are statements made at the police station in the investigatory record on page 8.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'In the statements you made at police station, you said that you went home at 6:30 p.m. at that day.' The correct form should be 'In the statements you made at the police station, you said that you went home at 6:30 p.m. on that day.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'After you have dinner, you looked down stairs quickly.' The correct form should be 'After you had dinner, you looked down the stairs quickly.'
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence 'So you go down stairs to check the situation immediately.' The correct form should be 'So you went down the stairs to check the situation immediately.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence 'Because you disagree with his statement, so you two have quarrel, right?' The correct form should be 'Because you disagreed with his statement, that's why you two had a quarrel, right?'

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
是的，事情大概就是這樣發生的。我想要強調的是，這不是我們第一次為了停車格的事情而吵架。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
You mean that both parties have many quarrels about the parking slot, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using the word 'quarrels' instead of 'disputes'.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我住在那個社區已經超過8個月了，這幾個月來，告訴人移我的摩托車，而且沒有經過我的同意。他只是不喜歡我把機車放在那個位子，但是他沒有任何理由可以這麼做。在這個社區，每個人都可以把機車停在有空位的地方。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '告訴人移我的摩托車' is incorrect. It should be '告訴人移動我的摩托車'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '沒有經過我的同意' is translated as 'without any reason' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'without my consent'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the plaintiff trying to move the motorbike 'more than once'.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Then, have you ever reported this kind of case in police station?

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
之前，我都想說要避免衝突，所以有的時候我就會不太在意，或者是假裝沒有看到這類的情形。針對剛剛的問題，我的回答是沒有，我沒有為這件事情報過案，但是其他的鄰居有遇到跟我類似的問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
Are there specific parking slots in your neighborhood?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of motorcycles in their translation.

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
null

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So, in your neighborhood, anyone can stop their motorcycle when there is an empty place?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
是的，只要有空位的話，任何人都可以停在那個空位裡。

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Then, are there any parking slot in the empty area?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Are there any parking slots in the empty area?'

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
是的，市政府有畫至少十格以上的停車格在那個空地。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '至少十個以上的停車格'.

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
In the investigatory record one on page 24, the picture showed that there are parking slots in the defendant’s neighborhood. The defendant, please check the picture.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific type of parking slots, which are for motorcycles.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，照片裡的就是我們社區的機車停車格。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'picture' from the translation, which is an important detail.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
Then, at that day, why did your quarrels become the physical confrontation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '口角' as 'quarrels' instead of 'verbal arguments'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'at that day' instead of 'that day' at the beginning of the sentence.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我看到有人在移我的摩托車的時候，我立刻從樓上衝到樓下去看發生甚麼事。就像我說的，我不是第一次遇到那樣的情形，所以在那個晚上，我就再也忍不住我的憤怒。當我下樓看的時候，我看到，告訴人已經把他的手放到我的摩托車上，我問他，為甚麼要移我的摩托車，他沒有回答，所以，我就更往前一步站，來阻止他行動。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '當我看到有人在移我的摩托車的時候' (When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle). The correct word order should be '當我看到有人在移我的摩托車時候'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我立刻從樓上衝到樓下去看發生甚麼事' (I rushed down to check what happened). The verb '看' (check) should agree with the subject '我' (I), so it should be '我立刻從樓上衝到樓下去看看發生甚麼事'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence '就像我說的，我不是第一次遇到那樣的情形' (As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle). The verb '遇到' (encounter) should be in the past tense to match the context, so it should be '就像我說的，我不是第一次遇到那樣的情形了'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '所以在那個晚上，我就再也忍不住我的憤怒' (I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night). The correct word order should be '所以在那個晚上，我就再也忍不住了我的憤怒'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '當我下樓看的時候' (When I went downstairs to see). The correct word order should be '當我下樓的時候看'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence '告訴人已經把他的手放到我的摩托車上' (The plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike). The correct word should be '原告' (plaintiff) instead of '告訴人' (teller).

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
Do you mean that you try to stop the accuser so it became in to the physical confrontation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by suggesting that the accuser tried to stop the speaker, leading to a physical confrontation.

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
對，當我推他放在機車把手上的手，他就是不放開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我推他放在機車把手上的手，他就是不放開。'

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Did you remember who start the physical confrontation first
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得是我把他的手從我的機車上拿開。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of 'trying to push his hands away,' the user's translation states 'taking his hands off my motorcycle.'

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
I’ll show the investigatory record one on page 8, the statement made at the police station. In investigatory record on page 9, line 10, the record showed that you tried to move the accuser’s hand on the motorcycle with much force because he grab your motorcycle tightly. You said that you moved first, so is that the move you said before?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '警局訊問記錄' as 'investigatory record' instead of 'police station statement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is awkward and does not follow the original text.

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
是的，剛那個就是我在警局裡描述的行動。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '剛剛那個' instead of '剛那個'.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
When you move the accuser’s hand, what is his reaction?

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有把手從我機車上移開，更糟糕的是，他把我的機車抓得更緊。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning by stating that the person did not remove their hand from the motorcycle, instead of not moving.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
So the other party did not move his hand from your motorcycle. Instead, he grab your motorcycle more tightly, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes.
是的

接下來發生什麼事呢？
Then, what happened next?

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
因為他不把手從我的機車上放開，所以我就推了他的肩膀，希望他可以把手放開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為他不把手從我的機車上放開，所以我就推了他的肩膀'.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
So that’s why you push his shoulder?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我有推他肩膀。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should be in the past tense to agree with the past tense of 'pushed'.

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Did you think that you push him with a strong force?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，我只是輕輕推他一下，就像是我們平常要提醒別人要做哪些事，或阻止別人做某件事的時候會有的那種輕輕推一下。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'like how we generally push others to do or not do something' is not present in the original text and introduces a different interpretation.

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我不曉得那些傷口和瘀青是怎麼來的，我並沒有造成他的這些傷口。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我並沒有造成他的這些傷口，我不曉得那些傷口和瘀青是怎麼來的。'

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there anyone can prove your statement? Is there any witness saw the situation at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is there anyone who can prove your statement?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'saw' should be in the past tense to match the past tense of 'the situation'. It should be 'Is there any witness who saw the situation that day?'

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
我的女朋友那時候也在家，她知道我那時候去處理那件事，她也有看到我們的事發經過。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她也知道我和那個鄰居之間的歷史。'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb '知道' (knew) should be past tense to match the original text. The correct translation should be '她知道我那時候去處理那件事。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the detail that the girlfriend is aware of the history between the speaker and the neighbor. The correct translation should include '她也知道我和那個鄰居之間的歷史。'

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
You mean that your girlfriend saw the procedure of your confrontation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
我的女友在我們爭執到一半的時候下樓，她有拿手機，試著錄下當時的過程，以防我們之後需要那段影片。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '在爭執到一半的時候，我的女友下樓。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'middle of the confrontation' which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened' which is an important detail in the original text.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
When did your girlfriend exactly came to saw your quarrels and try to record the clip?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did your girlfriend exactly come to see your quarrels and try to record the clip?'

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
她在我第一次嘗試想要抓我的機車的時候下來的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她在我第一次嘗試想要抓機車的時候下來的。'

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Then, did she record the clip successfully?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '拍成功' as 'record the clip successfully' which does not accurately convey the meaning of '拍成功' which means 'succeed in filming'.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，就在我女朋友拿出手機錄的時候，告訴人警告他不可以錄，但是他並沒有權利告訴我的女朋友這麼做。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has subject-verb agreement errors.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
Then, I have no further questions.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The defendant, today is the preliminary preparatory procedure. Do you need the court to investigate any evidence on your behalf in the next court?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
是的，我想要求法院調查那天兩個監視器裡面的影片。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想要求法院調查那天兩個監視器裡面的影片。'

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
You mean that there are two CCTV in your streets, and you want us to check the CCTV clips there? If so, can provide the exactly time or section that you want us to check specifically?

I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
我是在七點四十分下樓的，因此，我希望法院可以檢查七點三十到八點十分的影片。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我是在七點四十分下樓的' instead of '我是在七點四十分下樓的'.

檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
The prosecutor, do you have any questions about the defendant’s request?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

沒有意見。
No.

今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？
Today’s court is dismissed. The next court is set to be at 2:30 p.m. at August 8th 2020. In the next court, we will examine the CCTV clips and asked the opinions of the defendant and accuser. The defendant and the prosecutor, do you have any further questions?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The defendant and the prosecutor, do you have any further questions?' is incorrect. It should be 'Do you have any further questions, the defendant and the prosecutor?'

沒有。
No, I rest.

No.
我沒有，謝謝。

那今天開庭到此結束，請在簽完筆錄後離席，謝謝。
Then, today’s court is dismissed. The defendant, please sign the court record before you leave.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'Please sign the court record before you leave.'

如起訴書所載。
As stated in the indictment.

被告Steven Knox於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在其自家門口 （地址為：新北市板橋區長江路 23號6樓），因其摩托車被挪動而與鄰居（即告訴人）發生口角，進而產生肢體衝突。經告訴人至醫院驗傷，醫師診斷為手臂、身體多處挫傷、瘀青，後被提告。檢察官起訴被告違反刑法375條之傷害罪，被告做何答辯？
The incident happened at 7:50 p.m. on June 18, 2020. The location was in front of the defendant’s house. The address is Floor 4, No. 23, Changjiang Road, Banqiao District, New Taipei City. The defendant’s motorbike was moved by his neighbor also the accuser so they had argument and then evolved into physical confrontation. After the accuser went to the hospital…, the doctor found he suffered multiple injuries and bruises on his arms and body. …Therefore, the decedent was prosecuted to committhe attack of Clause 375 in the Criminal Law. For this, what’s your plea?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	decendent instead of defendant
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	commit the attack instead of commit the crime
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect placement of 'also the accuser'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the accuser's injuries

I plead not guilty.
無罪答辯
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '答辯無罪'.

今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
Today is the preparatory procedure. I’ll check and confirm the part of evidence usedin this case. If prosecutor and defendant have any questions about the evidence, you can ask the court. In today procedure, the defendant doesn’t apply for a lawyer and will speak for himself. Do you fully understand the procedure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'I’ll check and confirm the part of evidence used in this case.' The correct word order should be 'I’ll check and confirm the part of evidence used in this case.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the court's role in addressing questions about the evidence: 'If prosecutor and defendant have any questions about the evidence, you can ask the court.'

我也了解。

請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
Prosecutor, please show the evidence and ask the defendant some questions.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
Defendant, you had argument with your neighbor and evolved into physical confrontation because he moved your motorbike. The incident happened in front of your house at 7:50 p.m. on June 18, 2020. I’ll show you the statement made at the police station on P.8 in investigation record one. In the statement, you went back home at 6:30 p.m., parked your motorbike, and then went upstairs. After dinner, you looked down and saw someone move your motorbike so you went downstairs to check. When you went downstairs, you found your neighbor also the accuser 張大明was moving your motorbike. You asked him why he moved your motorbike. Then, he replied because your motorbike blocked his car and you couldn’t park here so he moved it. You disagreed with his statement so you had argument with him, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Defendant, you had argument with your neighbor and evolved into physical confrontation because he moved your motorbike.' is incorrect. It should be 'Defendant, you had an argument with your neighbor that evolved into a physical confrontation because he moved your motorbike.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '告訴人' as 'accuser' instead of 'neighbor'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the time of the incident in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the date of the incident in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the location of the incident in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the time of the argument in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the reason for the argument in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's disagreement with the neighbor's statement in the translation.

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
是的，事情就是這樣發生的。我只想強調這已經不是第一次為了這樣的是，而發生爭執了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只想強調這已經不是第一次為了這樣的事情而發生爭執了。'

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
You mean, it’s not the first time you argue about parking the motorbike?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我已經住在這裡至少八個月了。而告訴人已經不是第一次無故移動了我的摩托車。他只是看不慣我把車停在那裡…。這社區裡的每個人都可以停車在這裡，如果這裡有空位的話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence structure.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for the plaintiff's actions.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the plaintiff's dislike for the motorcycle parking.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the plaintiff's lack of authority in the matter.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the statement that everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park their vehicle.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever reported to the police …like this before?

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
之前發生口角時，我會想要避免衝突。有時候，我不會在意他移動我的車子。有時候，我會假裝沒看到。回答剛才的問題，我沒有去警局報案過，但其他鄰居也發生過類似的事。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
In your neighborhood, do you all park your motorbikes in fixed spaces?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you have fixed spaces for parking motorbikes in your neighborhood?'

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，我們可以停在任何的空位。也就是，先到的人先停。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '先到的人先停' instead of '先停的人先到'.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So, everyone can park his motorbike of there is empty space, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the plural subject 'everyone'.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
沒錯，只要有空位，大家都能停車在那裡。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'anyone' should be followed by the singular verb 'can park', not 'can park'

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Are there any parking slots drawn in the empty space?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'empty' which is an important detail in the original text.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
沒錯，市政府有畫超過10格停車格。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
I’ll show you the photo on P.24 in investigation record one. In the photo, there are parking slots for motorbikes. Defendant, please make sure.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the word 'investigation record' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'Defendant, please make sure' at the end of the sentence instead of after the mention of the photo.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
沒錯，照片裡面就是我們社區可以停放機車的停車格。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'parking slots' is translated as '停車格' which means 'parking spaces' instead of '停車位' which means 'parking slots'.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
How did your argument evolve into physical confrontation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我看到有人移動我的摩托車時，我便衝下樓查看。如我剛才所說，這已經不是第一次有人移動我的車。我那時已經忍無可忍。當我下樓時，我看到告訴人將手放在我摩托車的把手上。我問他在做什麼，但他沒有回我任何一句話。…
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '如我剛才所說' is incorrect. It should be '如我剛才所說的' to indicate that the speaker is referring to something mentioned earlier.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '回我' should agree with the subject '他', so it should be '回答我' instead of '回我'.

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
You mean when the accuser moved your motorbike, you want to stop him soyou have confrontation, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the accuser moved the motorbike instead of the accused.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order, resulting in a confusing sentence structure.

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
是的，當我試著握住我的摩托車把手時，他並沒有放手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb '放手' (let go) should come before the subject '他' (he).

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Do you remember who started first?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Do you remember who started first?'

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我只是想試著把他的手挪開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
I’ll show you the statement made at the police station on P.8 in investigatory record. On P.9 line 10, the accuser grabbed the handlebars tightly and moved your motorbike. So, you… pushed his hands away. …
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the accuser's intention to forcefully move the motorbike.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'pushed' instead of 'push' to match the subject 'you'.

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
是的，這就是我在警局陳述衝突發生的過程。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
When you pushed his hands away, what was the accuser’s reaction?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'pushed his hands away' as '撥開對方的手' which means 'move the other person's hands away' instead of 'push his hands away'.

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有鬆手。而且他甚至握得更緊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他甚至握得更緊。'

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
You mean the other party didn’t move his hands and even grabbed the handlebars tightly, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes.
沒錯

接下來發生什麼事呢？
What happened next?

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
因為從他的肢體語言來看，他看起來沒有想要鬆手。所以我才推了他的肩膀要他放開把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
Because of this, you pushed his shoulder, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我因為這樣推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Do you think you pushed his shoulder with much force?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '用力' as 'with much force' instead of 'pushed his shoulder'

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，我只是輕輕推了一下，就和其他人會推別人去做或不做一樣。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只是輕輕推了一下'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'like how we generally push others to do or not do something'.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
I’ll show you the hospitalization on P.48 in investigatory record one. In the hospitalization, there are multiple injuries and bruises on his arms and bodies.How did he suffer? Is it because you pushed his shoulder?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '診療證明' as 'investigatory record' instead of 'hospitalization'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'In the hospitalization record on page 48'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the doctor's diagnosis and only mentioned the injuries and bruises.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the question 'How did he suffer? Is it because you pushed his shoulder?' which is not present in the original text.

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我不知道為什麼他身上有多處的瘀青和受傷。這不是我造成的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'bruises or injuries'.

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there anyone who can verify your statement and the details of the incident?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
那時我女朋友正好在家。他知道我下樓，也知道這樣的事已經不是第一次發了。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'know' should agree with the subject 'she', so it should be 'she knows' instead of 'he knows'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'that neighbor' is translated as '這樣的事' which means 'this kind of thing' instead of referring to a specific neighbor.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
You mean your girlfriend spotted the incident at that time?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
她在我們爭執到一半時下樓，想要拍下當時案發的照片以作為證據。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她在爭執到一半時下樓'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of using a cell phone to film the incident.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
Specifically speaking, when did your girlfriend do downstairs and try to take a photo about the incident?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
就在我第一次握著把手時，她就下來了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她就下來了' instead of '就在我第一次握著把手時，她就下來了'.

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she take a photo successfully?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '拍成功' as 'take a photo successfully' instead of 'succeed in filming'.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，當我女朋友要拿手機出來時，告訴人就警告他，但他沒有權力制止她拍照。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'plaintiff' is translated as '告訴人' which means 'informant' or 'reporter' instead of '原告' which means 'plaintiff'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '警告' (warn) should agree with the subject '告訴人' (informant), so it should be '告訴人警告她' instead of '告訴人就警告他'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the plaintiff warned the girlfriend not to take out her cell phone, which is an important detail in the original text.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
I have no further questions.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
Today is the preliminary preparatory procedure. Before the next court, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
有，我想要法院調閱在場兩個監視器畫面。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'request' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '調閱' (to review) before the noun '法院' (court), which is incorrect word order in Chinese.

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
You mean there are CCTV cameras at that street and you want the court to check the CCTV clips, right? Can you provide the court with exact time for the segment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
我大約在晚上7:40下樓，所以我希望法院能調閱晚上7:30到8:10的片段。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我希望法院能調閱晚上7:30到8:10的片段，所以我大約在晚上7:40下樓。'

檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
Prosecutor, do you have any opinion about asking for the CCTV clips?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the defendant requesting to review the CCTV clips.

沒有意見。
No.

今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？
The preparatory procedure is dismissed today. The next court will be set at 2:30 p.m. on August 8, 2020. In the next court, we’ll check the CCTV clips and ask both parties some questions about this. Prosecutor and defendant, is there anything to add?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of reviewing the CCTV clips and asking both parties for their opinions.

沒有。
No, I rest.

No.
我也沒有問題。

那今天開庭到此結束，請在簽完筆錄後離席，謝謝。
The court will be ended here. Please sign the court record and then leave, thank you.

semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of 'appointed' in 'You have the right to a lawyer.'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user added 'the court' in 'you may ask the court for legal assistance.'

3. 你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
You have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence favorable to your case.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

被告是否了解以上權利？
Do you fully understand your right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'understand' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'Do you fully understand your rights?'

了解
Yes, I do.

今天告訴人因病向法院請假，因此今天的程序會先跟被告釐清當天的狀況，明白嗎?
Since the accuser is sick toady, so in the procedure we will ask the accused and clarify what happened on that day.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Today's procedure will first clarify the situation with the defendant due to the accuser's illness.'

I understand.
是的，我了解。

請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
Prosecutor, please state the crime.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'statement' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'Prosecutor' after the verb 'state', instead of before it.

如起訴書所載。
As stated in the indictment.

被告Steven Knox於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在其自家門口 （地址為：新北市板橋區長江路 23號6樓），因其摩托車被挪動而與鄰居（即告訴人）發生口角，進而產生肢體衝突。經告訴人至醫院驗傷，醫師診斷為手臂、身體多處挫傷、瘀青，後被提告。檢察官起訴被告違反刑法375條之傷害罪，被告做何答辯？
The incident happened at 7:50 p.m. on June 18, 2020. It happened in front of the accused’s house which is located at floor 6, number 23, Changjiang Road, Banqiao District, New Taipei City.… The motorcycle of the accused has been moved. Therefore, the accuser and accused have some argument, which caused their physical confrontation. Later, the accuser went to hospital to see his condition, and the doctor said that he had some scratches and bruises on his arm and the rest of his body. Therefore, the accuser filed a lawsuit against the accused. The accused violated the attack in the Criminal Law, number 375. What’s your plea
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the argument being verbal.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation leaves out the mention of the accused's motorcycle being moved.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the mention of the accused being sued.

I plead not guilty.
無罪答辯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I plead not guilty.'

今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
Today is preparatory procedure. The court will check and confirm the evidence used in this case. The prosecutor and the accused can talk about their opinion based on the evidence. Today the accused doesn’t have lawyer, so he will speak for himself. Do you understand the procedure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

了解。
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
我也了解。

請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
Prosecutor, please check and confirm the evidence used in this case and ask questions.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The accused, you have some argument and therefore have physical confrontation with the accuser at 7:50 p.m. on June 18, 2020. You have confrontation because your motorcycle was moved. In the evidence used in this case, that is, page 8 in Investigatory Record 1, there is a statement made in the police station. According to the statement you made in the police station, you went home at about 6:30 p.m. After you parked your motorcycle, you went upstairs. After you had a dinner, you look out of the window and saw someone at the downstairs was moving your motorcycle, so you went downstairs to check the situation. When you walked downstairs you saw… 大明張, who is the accuser of this case, was moving your motorcycle. Therefore, you asked the accuser why he moved your motorcycle, and the accuser said that your motorcycle had blocked his car. You should not park the motorcycle here, so he moved the motorcycle. Because you didn’t agree the other party’s answer, so you have an argument with the accuser. Is it right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'After you had a dinner, you look out of the window and saw someone at the downstairs was moving your motorcycle'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'When you walked downstairs you saw… 大明張, who is the accuser of this case, was moving your motorcycle'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'You have confrontation because your motorcycle was moved' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text, which states that an argument and physical confrontation occurred because the motorcycle was moved.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the accused and the accuser being neighbors, which is an important detail in the original text.

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
是的，那基本上是當時發生的情況。我想強調這已經不是第一次我們因為停車的關係發生口角。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
Do you mean that the quarrel on the motorcycle parking space between both parties was not happened for the first time?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我住在這個社區已經至少有八個月了，告訴人在沒有原因的情況下…移動我的摩托車已經超過一次了。他只是不喜歡我把摩托車停在那裡，但是他沒有任何理由去做這件事。 在社區，每個人都有權利把車子停在沒有人停的地方。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '告訴人在沒有原因的情況下…移動我的摩托車已經超過一次了' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '告訴人已經超過一次在沒有原因的情況下移動我的摩托車'.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever been to police station to report the incident like such case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Have you ever been to the police station to report a similar incident?'

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
我們之前發生口角的時候，我都會避免發生肢體衝突，有時候我並不介意我的摩托車被移，有時候我會假裝沒有這件事發生。對於告訴人回答，我是從來沒有去和警察報警，其他鄰居也有類似的經驗。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence structure.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect translation of 'confrontation' as '肢體衝突' (physical conflict) instead of '口角' (verbal argument).
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'with the police' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'to answer your question' in the translation.

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
In your community, does the parking of the motorcycle have the certain space?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，任何人都可以停在沒有人停的空位上，是先到先有的概念。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So for the parking of the motorcycle, can everyone park if the space is available?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
是的，只要有空位，任何人都可以去停車。

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Then, does the parking space have some parking slot?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
沒錯，我們的市政府有畫超過十個位置讓摩托車停放
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
According to page 24 in Investigatory Record, the picture shows that there are many parking spaces for motorcycle in their community. They have parking slots. Please confirm.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '有畫停車格' as 'they have parking slots' instead of 'there are painted parking spaces'

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，在這片裡面有我們社區的摩托車停車格。

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
Why did your quarrel at that day become physical confrontation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我從樓上看到有人移動我的摩托車，我就下樓來確認。就像我剛剛說的，已經不只一次有人移動我的摩托車了，我真的不喜歡這樣的事發生。當我下樓時，我看見告訴人的手放在我的摩托車把手上面，我就問他在做什麼，他沒有回我，於是我就向前想要制止他。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '當我從樓上看到有人移動我的摩托車' (When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs)

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
Do you mean that he was going to move your motorcycle, and you wanted to stop him, so you have physical confrontation with him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by suggesting a physical confrontation, while the original text only mentions a pushing incident.

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
沒錯，當我出手抓住我摩托車的把手，他也沒有停止抓著我的把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Do you remember who did this thing first?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you remember who first did this thing?'

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得我是要把他的手推開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
Please refer to page 8 in Investigatory Record about the record from the police. In line 10 on page 9 the accuser used his hand to hold the handlebars. He didn’t release his hands and he wanted to move the motorcycle. The accused tried to pushed his hands away. You said that you tried to push his hands away. Do you mean this action?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the accused tried to push the accuser's hands away.

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
沒錯，這是在事件發生之後我到警局做的筆錄。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
What’s the accuser’s reaction when you pushed away his hand
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'pushed away' as '撥開' which means 'move aside' instead of 'push away'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject 'you' after the verb 'pushed away' instead of before it.

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有移動，他反而是更用力的握著我的摩托車把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他反而是更用力的握著我的摩托車把手，他沒有移動。'

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
Do you mean that the other party didn’t put away his hands; instead, he grabbed the handlebars…tightly?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes.
沒錯。

接下來發生什麼事呢？
What happened next?

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
從他的肢體語言來看，他並不想要放手，所以我推了他的肩膀，希望他可以將手放開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為他的肢體語言告訴我，他不會放開我的摩托車，所以我推了他的肩膀，希望他能放開把手。'

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
Because of this, you pushed his shoulder. Is it right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我推了他的肩膀' instead of '我推了他的肩膀。'

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Do you think at that time you pushed him with much force?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '用力' as 'pushed him with much force' instead of 'did you put in a lot of effort'

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，我只是輕輕的推一下，就像是我們平常會推推別人的情況。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
Please refer to page 48 in the Investigatory Record. This is a medical evidence from Lian-He hospital. In the hospital diagnosis, there are multiple scratched and bruises on accuser’s body and his arm. Do you know how this injury happened? Is that because you pushed him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '告訴人' as 'accuser' instead of '身體' (body).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'accuser’s body and his arm' before 'multiple scratched and bruises', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the cause of the injuries.

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我不知道這些瘀青跟挫傷是怎麼造成的，那不是我造成的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不知道這些瘀青跟挫傷是怎麼造成的，那不是我造成的。'

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there anyone who can prove what you said about the situation happened at the night on that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
那天晚上我女友在家，他知道我下樓，他也知道我和告訴人之間發生了什麼事。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'know' should agree with the subject 'she', so it should be 'she knows' instead of 'he knows'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun 'he' should be 'she' to refer to the girlfriend.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
Do you mean that your girlfriend had seen what happened at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
她有下樓來並且介入我們的肢體衝突，她…拿起手機拍下影片，以免我們需要影片來知道發生了甚麼事。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '她下樓來' instead of '她有下樓來'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '介入我們的肢體衝突' is translated as 'interfere with our physical conflict', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'came down in the middle of the confrontation'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The phrase 'just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened' is omitted in the translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The phrase '以免我們需要影片來知道發生了甚麼事' is added in the translation, which is not present in the original text.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
Please said more precisely when your girlfriend went downstairs and tried to use her cellphone to take a film.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
她在我第一次要嘗試去抓我的摩托車把手時到達了現場。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she take the film successfully?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，當我女朋友拿出手機時，告訴人就警告她不要這樣做，但告訴人其實沒有權利這樣制止她。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'plaintiff' as '告訴人' (informant) instead of '原告' (plaintiff).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '我女朋友' (my girlfriend) before the verb '拿出' (took out), resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff warning the girlfriend, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff having no right to tell her not to use her cell phone.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
My question will end here.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The accused, today is the preliminary preparatory procedure. Is there further evidence you want the court to investigate for you before the next court date?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
有，我希望法院能夠調閱當天的兩台監視器，看看監視器裡的畫面。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the request for the court to look into the clips taken by the CCTV cameras.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
Do you mean that there are CCTV clips at the alley of your community, and you hope us to request for the CCTV clips? If yes, can you tell us which place or area you want us to request the CCTV clips? Can you give us the certain time?

I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
我當天是在大約晚上7點40的時候下樓，所以我希望法院可以調查7點半到8點10分左右的監視器影片。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我當天是在晚上7點40的時候下樓'.

檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
Prosecutor, do you have anything to add about the accused want to request the CCTV clips?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the prosecutor's opinion.

沒有意見。
No, I don’t.

今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？
The preparatory procedure toady is dismissed. The next court date will set to be at 2:30 p.m. on August 8, 2020. On that day we will check the content of the CCTV clips and ask questions to both parties. Prosecutor and accused, do you have any further question.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The preparatory procedure toady is dismissed' is incorrect. It should be 'The preparatory procedure today is dismissed.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the sentence 'The next court date will set to be at 2:30 p.m. on August 8, 2020' is incorrect. It should be 'The next court date is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. on August 8, 2020.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of reviewing the surveillance video content in the court session.

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The defendant at 7:50 pm, on June 18th, 2020, you were at the door of your house and you had a quarrel with your neighbor because of your motorcycle was moved. After that, the situation evolved into physical confrontation. As for the checking and confirmation of the evidence used in this case, we can look at the investigatory record on page 8, there are statements made at the police station. At the police station, and in the statement, you said that around 6:30 pm, you arrived at your house and after you parked your motorcycle, you went upstairs. After you had dinner, and you looked down from the window, you saw that there was a person who was about to move your motorcycle, so you went downstairs and checked the situation. When you went downstairs you encountered the accuser, 張大明, he was removing your motorcycle. So you asked the accuser why do you have to remove my motorbike, and the accuser said that because the motorbike blocked his car and he shouldn’t park his motorbike there, so the accuser removed the motorbike. The defendant, since you disagree with the accuser, so you had a quarrel.

grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'When you went downstairs you encountered the accuser, 張大明, he was removing your motorcycle.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Misinterpretation of the word 'accuser' as the name of the person instead of the role in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for the quarrel between the defendant and the accuser.

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
基本上就是事發的原因。我想強調的是，這不是我們第一次因為移動車子的事而發生口角了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '基本上就是事發的原因' instead of '事發的原因基本上就是'.

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
Do you mean that you both had a quarrel upon the issue of parking space, and it was not the first time, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我已經住在這個社區至少八個月了，那告訴人也是不止一次挪動我的摩托車，而且每次都是無緣無故的。他就只是不喜歡我把摩托車停在那裡，他根本沒有任何立場可以這樣做。所有住在這個社區的人都有權利把車停在可停的地方。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '那告訴人也是不止一次挪動我的摩托車' should be '那個告訴人不止一次挪動我的摩托車'.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever been to the police station for such kind of incident and to have to make a statement?

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
我們之前發生口角的時候，我都會盡量的避免衝突，有時候我還不在意他挪動我的摩托車，那也有一些時候我會假裝什麼事都沒發生。要回答這個問題，就是我都沒有去警察局備案過，但其他鄰居有發生過類似的事情。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '有時候我還不在意他挪動我的摩托車' should be '有時候我還在意他挪動我的摩托車'.

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
In your community, are there particular parking spaces for the motorbikes?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of motorcycles in their translation.

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，我們沒有固定的停放位置，只要有空間就可以停放，也就是採取先到先有的方式。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So you mean that if there are any parking spaces or any empty spaces, everyone is OK to park there, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
沒錯，只要有空位大家就可以停車。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'anyone' should be followed by the singular verb 'can park', not 'can park'.

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Are there any slots on your parking spot?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Are there any parking slots on your spot?'

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
是的，市府有畫超過10個專屬機車的停車格。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '市府有畫超過10個專屬的機車停車格。'

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
In the investigator and record page 45, there is a picture and the picture shows that in your community, every motorcycle has their own marked parking slot, the defendant, please confirm.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '提示偵券(一)' as 'investigator and record page 45'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'the defendant' at the end of the sentence instead of after 'please confirm'.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，照片裡面就顯示了我們社區的摩托車都有專屬停車格。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
So on that day, why did you... how did the quarrel evolve into physical confrontation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我看到我的摩托車被挪動時，我正站在樓上看，所以我就趕快衝下樓察看。就像我剛剛說的，這已經不是第一次有人移動我的摩托車了，所以我那次真的不想要再忍了。當我下樓的時候，我看到告訴人把他的手放在我的機車把手上，我就問他說：「你在做什麼！」但他並沒有回我，所以我就衝上前試圖要阻止他。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我正站在樓上看' is incorrect. It should be '我正站在樓上看到' to indicate that the speaker saw someone moving their motorcycle while they were upstairs.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'tolerating the matter' as '再忍了' is not accurate. It should be translated as '再容忍' or '再忍受' to convey the meaning of enduring or putting up with the situation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我看到告訴人把他的手放在我的機車把手上' is incorrect. It should be '我看到告訴人把他的手放在我的機車把手上' to indicate that the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of the speaker's motorbike.

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
What you meant was when you stepped forward and tried to stop the plaintiff, so you pushed against each other, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by changing the meaning of '發生推擠情事' (occurrence of pushing and shoving) to 'pushing against each other'.

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
沒錯，當我將我的手放在機車把手上的時候，告訴人並沒有把手鬆開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '告訴人並沒有把手鬆開' instead of '告訴人沒有把手鬆開'.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Did you remember who made the move first?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you remember' instead of 'Did you remember'.

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得那時候我嘗試要把他的手推開
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
In investigatory record, one on page 8, there is a inquiry made at the police station. On page 9, line 10, you said that the other party was grabbing the handlebars tightly and you tried to push his hands away. As you mentioned, you said that you made the move first, is that moved this move?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the other party was trying to forcefully move the motorcycle.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect and lacks clarity.

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
沒錯，那就是我在事發過後做的筆錄。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '那就是我在事發過後做的筆錄。'

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
When you were pushing away his hands, what was his reaction?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他並沒有鬆開手，反而更用力地抓住把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb phrase 'grabbed the handlebars' should come before the adverb 'even more tightly'.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
Therefore, you mean that the accused not only let go the handlebars. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars with much force.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the accused grabbed the handlebars with much force, while the original text does not mention the level of force.

Yes.
沒錯。

接下來發生什麼事呢？
What happened next?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'next' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
因為他的肢體語言告訴我說他並不想要放開，所以我就推了他的肩膀，希望他可以鬆開把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為他的肢體語言告訴我說他不想放開，所以我推了他的肩膀，希望他可以鬆開把手。'

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
Therefore, you pushed his shoulder, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Did you push his shoulder like that?'

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我有推他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should be in the past tense to agree with the past tense of 'pushed'.

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Did you pushed his shoulders tightly...with much force?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you push his shoulders tightly...with much force?'

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有我只是輕輕地，像告知性的推他那樣，就像我們平常提醒別人一樣。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes a cultural transformation by using the phrase '告知性的推他' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'gentle push' in the original text.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
The following is the investigatory record one, page 48, it is a diagnosis from the city Union Hospital. In the diagnosis, the doctor pointed out that on the body and arms of the plaintiff, there were multiple bruises and scratches, so is your pushing his shoulders caused this injury?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '挫傷' as 'scratches' instead of 'bruises'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'so' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'caused'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '多處' (multiple) in the translation.

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我根本不知道這些瘀青還有傷口是哪裡來的，我根本什麼都沒做。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我根本不知道這些瘀青還有傷口是哪裡來的，我根本什麼都沒做。'

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there any witness can clarify the situation that day？
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the specific time frame 'evening' mentioned in the original text.

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
當天我的女朋友在家，她也知道我下樓來查看，而且她也很了解我和鄰居之前發生過的事。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當天我的女朋友在家'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'she knew' as '她也知道' is incorrect. It should be translated as '她知道'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'she is also aware' as '她也很了解' is incorrect. It should be translated as '她也知道'.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
You meant that your girlfriend saw the situation and the process？
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
當我們衝突發生到一半的時候，我女友就下樓了，當時她用手機將事發過程錄影下來，以便我們證明事發過程。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我們衝突發生到一半的時候，我女友就下樓了'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened' is translated as '以便我們證明事發過程', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
Precisely speaking, what was the exact time did your girlfriend came to the spot and used her cell phone to record everything?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'What was the exact time your girlfriend came to the spot and used her cell phone to record everything?'

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
就在我第一次嘗試要去握機車把手的時候，我女朋友就到了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我女朋友就到了' instead of '就在我第一次嘗試要去握機車把手的時候，我女朋友就到了。'

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Afterwards, did she film the situation successfully?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '拍成功' as 'film the situation successfully', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，當我女朋友要把手機拿出來錄影的時候，告訴人就警告他說不要拍，但他根本沒有權力這樣做。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning by referring to the plaintiff as '我女朋友' (my girlfriend) instead of '原告' (the plaintiff).
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '拍' (to take a photo) should agree with the subject '告訴人' (the plaintiff), but it is in the wrong form.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the plaintiff warning the person not to record with their cell phone.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the unnecessary detail of the person being the translator's girlfriend.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
So my questions will temporarily ends here.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The defendant, today we are here for a preliminary preparatory procedure, before the next court date, do you have anything to investigate, and the can court can investigate for you on your behalf.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
是的，我想要要求法院幫我檢視當天錄到事發過程的兩支監視器。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'taken' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
You meant that there were CCTVs in front of your alley, so you want us to check the CCTV clips, right? If yes, what exact section or segment you want us to check for you and extract for you?

I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
我當時大約在晚上7:40分的時候下樓，所以我希望法院可以幫我調閱大概是7:30到8:10之間的錄影畫面。

Further, we will inquire both parties to make your own statements. Prosecutor and the defendant, do you have anything to add?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The preparatory procedure today is dismissed here' is incorrect. It should be 'The preparatory procedure today ends here.'

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
呃…對…基本上事情就是這麼經過的。我得說，這並不是我們第一次因為停摩托車的問題起口角。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
You mean it was not the first time you two had a quarrel about where to park the motorcycle?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我在那個社區已經住了大概八個月…在這之間告訴人有很多次都未經任何提示或說明就亂移我的摩托車。他就是不喜歡我把摩托車停在那裡，但是他沒有任何立場以及理由去做這件事。住在這個社區裡面的人本來就有權力把車停在…把車子或摩托車停在空位上，只要那個位子是可以的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence structure.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in 'Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Incorrect translation of 'move my motorbike' as '亂移我的摩托車' which means 'move my motorbike randomly' instead of 'try to move my motorbike'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the phrase 'without any reason' in 'The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason'.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of the phrase '在這之間告訴人有很多次都未經任何提示或說明' which means 'many times without any notice or explanation in between' and is not present in the original text.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in 'Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space' which should be translated as '每個社區居民都有權利停放他/她的車輛，只要有空位'.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever been the police station for record for such incident?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Have you ever been to the police station for record for such an incident?'

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
當我們起口角的時候，我都會盡全力避免有進一步的衝突，很多時候我也不會去在乎他亂移我的摩托車，有時候我甚至會裝作我不知道。那麼回到你的問題，我從來沒有在警察局備案過，但是其他得鄰居其實有遇到類似的情況。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我都會盡全力避免有進一步的衝突' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我都會盡全力避免進一步的衝突'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'before' in the sentence '當我們起口角的時候'. The correct translation should be '當我們起口角之前的時候'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'with the police' in the sentence '我從來沒有在警察局備案過'. The correct translation should be '我從來沒有向警察局備案過'.

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
In your community, are there any stable parking slots for motorcycle?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Are there any stable parking slots for motorcycles in your community?'

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，基本上只要有空格我們就能把車子停在裡面，那這個概念就有點像是你先到就可以先停。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the concept of 'first-come-first-serve' as '先到先停' (first to arrive, first to park), which is not an accurate representation of the original meaning.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So, about the parking of motorcycles. You mean that one park his or her motorcycle whenever there is an empty space, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
是的，只要有空位就可以把摩托車停進去。

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
So, about the parking spaces, are they the parking slots, that means… that means… are there any lines and blocks on it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of '停車格' as 'parking slots' is incorrect. It should be translated as 'parking spaces'.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
沒有錯，是政府有在那裏畫了超過十個摩托車的停車格。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '政府有在那裏畫了超過十個停車格的摩托車。'

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
According to page 24 of the investigatory record, in the picture there are actually parking slots in your community, the accused, please check the picture.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the accused in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the plural verb 'are' instead of the singular verb 'is' to agree with the singular noun 'picture'.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，照片裡面就是我們社區的摩托車停車格。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'slots' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
At that day, how come your quarrel become a physical confrontation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當時我在樓上，當我看到有人在移我摩托車的時候，我馬上就衝到樓下。如我剛剛所說的，這並不是第一次有人移我的摩托車，而在那天晚上，我覺得我不想再忍下去了。我下樓的時候看到告訴人正抓著我的把手，所以我走向前問他說他到底在做甚麼，但是他沒有回答，於是我就出手阻止他繼續動我的摩托車。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '如我剛剛所說的' should be '正如我剛剛所說的'.

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
You mean…you two had…physical contact like pushing because you want him to stop moving your motorcycle, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by suggesting that there was physical contact involved in the situation, which is not mentioned in the original text.

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
沒錯，在我出手要拿回我的摩托車把手的時候，他也沒有放手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '在我出手要拿回我的摩托車把手的時候'.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Do you remember…do you remember…how it begin…begin like who hit who first?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得是我先想要把他的手推開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
…In the investigatory record page 8, the question and answer in the police station.On page 9 line 10, you stated that the accuser tried to force to move your motorcycle, so you pushed his hands away from your handle bar.You said you are the first one started the physical confrontation, is that what you mean?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the accuser grabbing the motorcycle handlebar.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'tried' instead of 'tried to' in the sentence 'the accuser tried to force to move your motorcycle'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'his hands' before 'away' in the sentence 'you pushed his hands away from your handle bar'.

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
沒錯，這是我在事件發生以後在警察局提供的筆錄。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
When you pushed the other party’s hand away, what was his reaction?

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有鬆手，他甚至掐得更用力。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text by stating that the person grabbed the handlebars even more tightly, while the original text only mentions that he held onto them tightly.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
You mean, the other party grabbed the handle bar of your motorcycle even more tightly instead of letting it go, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes.
沒有錯。

接下來發生什麼事呢？
Then what happened next?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'Then' at the beginning of the sentence, which is an important detail in the original text.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
因為他的肢體語言告訴我，他並沒有要鬆手，所以我接下來推他的肩膀，希望他可以因此放手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為他的肢體語言告訴我，他並沒有要鬆手'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'let go of my motorcycle' as '放手' is incorrect. It should be translated as '放開我的摩托車'.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
As a result, you pushed his shoulder, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
沒錯，我推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '推了' should agree with the subject '我', so it should be '推了' instead of '推了'.

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Did you do that with… a strong force or not?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，我只是輕輕地推一下，大概就是我們平常制止別人的時候會用的那個力道。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '制止別人的時候會用的那個力道' does not capture the idea of a gentle push.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
Let’s move to page 48 of the investigatory record that’s is the therapy statement of 聯合hospital.In the statement of the doctor, … he stated that there are multiple bruises and contusions on the accuser’s body and arm. Is that what you caused? Is that caused because you pushed him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '診療證明' as 'therapy statement'
grammar and structure	word order errors	rearrangement of sentence structure
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the cause of the bruises and contusions

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我也不知道那些瘀青跟傷是怎麼造成的，我真的不知道，那不是我做的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'bruises' as '瘀青' is incorrect. The correct translation should be '淤血' or '瘀斑'.

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there any witness of what happened that day, in other words, is there anyone can explain what happened that night for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
那晚我和我女朋友在一起，她也在我家，所以她也知道我下樓去，那麼她也知道我和告訴人之間發生過的事情。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我和我女朋友在一起' instead of '我和我女朋友在一起'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'history between me and that neighbor' as '我和告訴人之間發生過的事情' is not accurate. It should be translated as '我和那個鄰居之間的歷史'.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
Do you mean that your girlfriend witnessed what happened that night?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
在我們發生衝突了以後，我女朋友也來到樓下，並且她原本也想要用手機錄影 以防我們以後要…證據來證明說那晚發生了甚麼事
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'girlfriend' was translated as '女朋友' which means 'girlfriend' in a romantic relationship, but the original text refers to 'she' which indicates a female person who is not necessarily in a romantic relationship.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The phrase '在我們發生衝突了以後' should be placed at the beginning of the sentence to match the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'in the middle of the confrontation' which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened' which is an important detail in the original text.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
Please state more precisely when did your girlfriend came up…down stair and try to film the whole confrontation by her phone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
她在我第一次要奪回我的把手的時候就下來了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she successfully film the confrontation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '拍成功' as 'film the confrontation', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，在她一把手機拿出來，告訴人就警告她不准這樣做，但是他明明就沒有權利這樣要求。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '在她拿出手機的時候，原告警告她不要這樣做。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'He had no right to tell her that' is incorrect. It should be translated as '他沒有權利這樣告訴她。'

那我的問題先問到這裡。
Then, that’s the end of my questions.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The accused, today’s case is the primary…preparatory procedure, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
有的，我希望能夠幫我調閱當天…的…兩台監視器裡面的畫面
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '調閱' which means 'retrieve' instead of '查看' which means 'look into'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '當天' after the object '兩台監視器裡面的畫面', which is incorrect. It should be '當天的兩台監視器裡面的畫面'.

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
You mean there are CCTV in your comm and you want us to investigate the clip for you?If that is true, can you tell the specific area or…more specifically when… I mean when the incident the happened.

I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
我記得我當天大概是在晚上七點三十分下樓的，所以我希望法院可以幫我調閱晚上七點三十到八點十分左右的畫面。

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'the court' in the request to examine the clips. The correct translation should include '法院' to indicate that the request is directed towards the court.

檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？

After you finished your dinner, you saw someone was moving your motorbike. Therefore, you go downstairs to check out. When you came downstairs, you found out that the accuser, Chang da-min was moving your motorbike. You ask the accuse why you’re moving my motorbike. The accuser answered that because your motorbike was blocking my way of my car. And you shouldn’t parked your motorbike on that position. Therefore, I move your motorbike. Because you are not agree with the answer of the accuser. So you have the argument about this, right?

是的，這就是基本上發生的事情過程。 我只是想強調這不是我和他因為我的摩托車的位置第一次有爭吵了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我離開這個社區已經八個月了。在這段時間裡面，告訴人已經想要移動我的摩托車超過一次了。他只是不喜歡我將我的摩托車放在那個位置。但他沒有立場這麼做。在這個社區裡面，每個人都有權利去停放他的摩托車，只要有空位。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever been to the police station for the case because of the moving of motorbike?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
之前發生爭吵的時候，我會盡量避免和告訴人發生爭吵。有時候我會阻止它移動我的摩托車。有時候我會當作沒有發生一樣。先回答你剛剛的問題，我沒有去警局備案過。其他鄰居也有發生相同的問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我會阻止它移動我的摩托車' should be '我會阻止他移動我的摩托車'.

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
In your society, is there the accurate place for parking motorbike?

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，我們可以停放在任何有空位的地方，這是一個先到先有的權利。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們可以停放在任何有空位的地方'.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
Concerning the issue of parking of the motorbike. If there are the empty place, anyone can park his motorbike, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the singular subject 'anyone'.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
沒錯，只要有空位任何人都可以停放他的摩托車。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'anyone' should be followed by the singular verb 'can park', not 'can park'

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Are there parking slot on your motorbike parking place?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Are there parking slots for motorbikes in your parking place?'

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
是的，市政府有在我們的社區劃設十幾個專為摩托車設計的停車格。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '十幾個專為摩托車設計的停車格' instead of '專為摩托車設計的十幾個停車格'.

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
According to the investigatory record page 24. The photo shows that there are parking slots in the defendant’s community. Defendant, please confirm it.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，這照片裡我的社區裡有位了摩托車而設的停車格。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
On that day, why you have the physical confrontation after you had the argument with each other?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
Do you mean that because he trying to move your motorbike. Then you want to stop him. Therefore, you have some physical confrontation, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using 'physical confrontation' instead of 'pushing and shoving'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the sentence 'Then you want to stop him.' It should be 'Then you wanted to stop him.'

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
沒錯，當我想要將我的摩托車拿回來的時候他並沒有放手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb '拿回來' (take back) should come before the object '我的摩托車' (my motorcycle).

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Do you remember who had the physical to each other first?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得我想要把他的手推開
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
The statement made at the police station is on the investigatory record page 8. On the page 9 line 10. You have mention that the accuser grabbed your motorbike handlebar. Therefore, your try to remove his hands on the handlebar. You just mentioned that you take the action first. Does that mean the movement?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '撥開' as 'remove' instead of 'push away'

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
是的，這就是在事發後我在警局做的筆錄。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這就是我在事發後在警局做的筆錄。'

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
When you remove the hands of the accuser. What’s his reaction?

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有移動而且甚至更用力地抓住我的機車把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他甚至更用力地抓住我的機車把手，而沒有移動。'

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
Do you mean that the accuser did not let his hands go? And he grab the handle bar with much force.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

Yes.
是的，沒錯

接下來發生什麼事呢？
Then, what’s happened?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'next' which is an important detail in the original text.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
因為他的肢體語言告訴我說他不會放開我的摩托車。所以我推了他的肩膀迫使他放開我的摩托車。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為他的肢體語言告訴我說他不會放開我的摩托車，所以我推了他的肩膀迫使他放開。'

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
So you pushed his shoulder, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
沒錯，我推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '推了' should agree with the subject '我', so it should be '推了' instead of '推了'.

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Did you think you push him with much force?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'push' was translated as '用力' which means 'with force', but it should be translated as '推' which means 'push'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'Did you think you pushed him with much force?'

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有我只是輕輕的推了一下，就像一般的人在催促會或是不想要你做什麼事情的時候一樣。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像一般的人在催促你做或不做某事的時候一樣。'

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
Then we will ask the investigatory record page 48. This is the evidence of the diagnosis of the city hospital. In the doctor’s diagnosis evidence. There are multiple bruise and injuries on the accuser’s body and his hand. Did you made it because of your pushing him?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '告訴人' as 'accuser' instead of 'patient'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'Did you make it because of your pushing him?'

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我不知道那些擦傷還有那些瘀青是怎麼發生的，我並沒有做這些事。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不知道那些擦傷還有那些瘀青是怎麼發生的，我並沒有做這些事。'

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there anyone can prove your statement and the situation at the incident?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is there anyone who can prove...' instead of 'Is there anyone can prove...'

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
我的女朋友在家只有他知道我和鄰居事發的經過
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '只有他知道我和鄰居事發的經過'.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
Did you mean that your girlfriend witness the procedure of the incident?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
他在我們爭吵過程的中間就下來了。她用手機拍下了我們的爭吵過程以防之後我想要證明我的清白
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她在我們爭吵過程的中間就下來了。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened' is incorrect. It should be translated as '以防之後我們需要這段視頻來證明發生了什麼。'

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
Please be accurate. When were your girlfriend arrived the situation. Did she filmed the incident with her cellphone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did your girlfriend arrive at the scene?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'arrived' should agree with the subject 'your girlfriend', so it should be 'When did your girlfriend arrive at the scene?'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'arrived' should be in the past tense to match the time frame of the question. It should be 'When did your girlfriend arrive at the scene?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The question should end with a question mark. It should be 'When did your girlfriend arrive at the scene?'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'situation' should be replaced with 'scene' to accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'filmed the incident' should be replaced with 'recorded the incident' to accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
他抵達事發現場當我第一次想要阻止他移動我的摩托車的時候
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she film the incident successfully?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，當我女友拿出手機的時候。告訴人就警告我女友不能拍，但是他沒有權力這麼說。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'plaintiff' as '告訴人' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'plaintiff'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form '警告' instead of '警告了' to indicate past tense.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff warning the girlfriend not to take photos.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
Then my questions will end here.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The defendant, today is the preparatory procedure. Before our next court, do you need the court to investigate any evidence for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Today is the preparatory procedure.'

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
是的，我想要要求檢方去查閱當天事發經過路口的兩句監視器畫面
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of CCTV cameras.

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
You mean that there are monitors on your street. so you want us to have the CCTV clips, right? If yes, which area or when should we retrieve the CCTV clips?

I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
我記得我是7點50分下樓的，所以我希望法院可以去調閱7點半到8點之間的監視器畫面。

檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
Prosecutor, do you have anything to add with the examine of CCTV clips?

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The accused, did the incident happened at 7:50 p.m. June 18th, 2020, in front of your house? You have quarrels with your neighbor, which turned out to be the physical confrontation, right?In the first evidence which is the statement made in the Police Station, which are also the investigatory record No.1.According to the statement you made in the Police Station, you mentioned that you went home at around 6:30.

grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'did the incident happened'

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
是，這基本上就是事情的經過。我還要強調一點，像這種情況並不是第一次發生，我之前也要求過他移動摩托車。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '要求' (to request) should come before the object '他' (him).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the argument was about the parking issue of the motorbike.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added unnecessary information by stating that it was not the first time they argued about the parking issue.

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
You mean that this was not the first argument with respect to the parking location of the motorbike?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我已經在這個社區住了八個月的時間，但告訴人並非第一次試圖移動我的摩托車。他只是很討厭我把車子停在那邊，但他沒有任何理由這麼做。在社區裡，每個人都有權利去停放自己的汽車或機車在有空位的地方。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '但告訴人並非第一次試圖移動我的摩托車' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但原告並非第一次試圖移動我的摩托車'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '試圖' should agree with the subject '原告', so it should be '試圖' instead of '試圖'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '但他沒有任何理由這麼做' is a mismatched meaning. It should be translated as '但他沒有任何理由移動我的摩托車' to convey the correct meaning.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Then, have both party went to the Police station and have the identical record for the same incident?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
我們之前的確有過口角，但都沒有發展成肢體衝突。有時候，我甚至會對摩托車被移走的這件事視而不見。先回答前一個問題，我從來沒有到警局備過案，但我知道有些鄰居也發生過相同的問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我從來沒有到警局備過案' should be '我從來沒有備過案到警局'.

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
Do you have the regular places that everyone parks their motorbike in your community?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific type of vehicle, which is 'motorbike'.

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，事實上，我們可以把車停在任何有空位的停車格裡，基本上就是先到先有的概念。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '事實上，我們可以把車停在任何有空位的停車格裡，基本上就是先到先有的概念。'

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
In terms of the parking of the motorbike, basically you can park your motorbike wherever you want if there is a place.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
沒錯，只要有看到空位，每個人都可以將他的車輛停在裡面。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'his/her motorbike' should agree with the verb 'park', but the verb is in the plural form 'park'.

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Is there any block on where the car parking?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
有的，市政府有畫了十多個停車個在那邊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
According to the investigatory record on p.24, there’s a photo shows there are parking lot in the accused’s community. Please check these photos.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'drawn' in the phrase '有畫停車格' which means 'painted parking spaces'.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，在照片裡的是我家附近的機車停車格。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'neighborhood' in their translation.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
Then, how did the situation turned out the be the physical confrontation after the argument.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '口角' as 'argument' instead of 'quarrel'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'the' before 'physical confrontation' instead of after.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我在樓上看到有陌生人在移動我的摩托車時，我就趕緊下樓察看。就像我剛說的，有人移動我摩托車已經不是第一次，那天下午，我覺得我已經忍無可忍了。當我下樓時，我看到告訴人正把手放在我的機車上，問他他在幹什麼，但對方沉默不語，於是我就上前阻止他。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '當我在樓上看到有陌生人在移動我的摩托車時' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我在樓上看到有陌生人在移動我的摩托車時'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我就趕緊下樓察看'. The correct form should be '我就趕緊下樓查看'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	There is a tense error in the sentence '就像我剛說的'. The correct form should be '就像我剛才說的'.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '問他他在幹什麼' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '問他他在做什麼'.

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
You mean that when you were trying to move your motorbike, and you came up to stop him. That’s the reason why the physical confrontation happened?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
沒錯，當我上前準備抓住我的摩托車把手時，他卻沒有放手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我準備抓住我的摩托車把手時'.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Do you still remember who was the first one attack the other?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得那個時候我試圖把他的手推開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試圖把他的手推開' instead of '我記得那個時候我試圖把他的手推開'.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
The statement made at the Police Station, it’s also investigatory record one is as follows.On P.9, line 10, you mentioned that the other party grabbed the motorbike tightly, you tried to let him take the hand out of the handlebars.You just mentioned that you’re the first one to attack him, do you mean that was such behavior you move?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misinterpreted the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
是的，這就跟我在警局裡提到的一樣，在衝突發生之後。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '在衝突發生之後，這就跟我在警局裡提到的一樣。'

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
What’s his reaction when you tried to take his hands out your motorbike?

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有要放手的打算，反之，他抓得更用力了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb 'grabbed' should come before the subject 'he'.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
You mean that he didn’t tried to move his hand: rather, he grabbed the handlebar more tightly?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

Yes.
null

接下來發生什麼事呢？
And what happened next?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'And' at the beginning of the sentence.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
從他的肢體語言來看，我相信他終究是不會放手的，所以我就用力推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我相信他終究是不會放手的' instead of '從他的肢體語言來看，我相信他終究是不會放手的'.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
So, you pushed his shoulder, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
沒錯，我推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '推了' should agree with the subject '我', so it should be '推了' instead of '推了'.

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Do you think that you did it with much force at that time?

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，我只是輕輕地推他，就像我們平常會輕輕地碰一下對方的肩膀，告訴他們去做些什麼事情這樣。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb should come before the object in this sentence.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
Next, let’s look at the p.48 on the investigatory record one, it’s the treatment result came from the Capital United Hospital.According to this file, we can see there are many bruises on the accuser’s body and arms, do you have any idea how did he injured? Does it come from your push on his shoulder?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user incorrectly translated '診療證明' as 'investigatory record one' instead of 'treatment result'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '告訴人' as 'accuser' instead of 'the person being told'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'Does it come from your push on his shoulder?' instead of 'Does it come from your push on his shoulder?'

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我不曉得他身上的那些瘀青是怎麼來的，我認為不是我做的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'bruises or injuries' as '瘀青' is incorrect. '瘀青' specifically refers to bruises, but not injuries in general.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我不曉得那些瘀青或傷口是怎麼來的'.

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there anyone are able to prove what you just mentioned and what happened that evening?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'are' should be 'is' to agree with the singular subject 'anyone'.

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
當天我和我的女朋友待在一起，所以她有看到我下樓，她也很清楚過去我和我那位鄰居之間的衝突。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我和我的女朋友当天待在一起'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'home' as '一起' is incorrect. '一起' means 'together' or 'in company', but 'home' should be translated as '家' or '家里'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The translation omits the information that the girlfriend knew about the history between the speaker and the neighbor. This detail should be included in the translation.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
Do you mean that your girlfriend witnessed what happened that day?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
我的女朋友在我們爭執到一半的時候就下樓查看，她也試圖拿手機錄下事情發生的經過，以防之後可能會使用到。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '在爭執到一半的時候'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'middle of the confrontation', which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened', which is an important detail in the original text.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
More specifically, what’s the timing that your girlfriend witnessed the incident and tried to film the video.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'What's the timing at which your girlfriend witnessed the incident and tried to film the video?'

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
就在我第一次試圖要抓住機車把手時，我的女朋友就下來了。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the sentence by introducing the girlfriend's action of getting off the motorcycle, which is not mentioned in the original text.

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she film the video she want?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，當我的女朋友拿出手機時，對方就立馬制止了我的女朋友，說她並沒有權力這麼做。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning by stating that the plaintiff immediately stopped the user's girlfriend and claimed that she had no right to do so.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
Then, that’s all the questions for you.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The accused, today is only the preparatory procedure. Do you need to court investigate any evidence for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
是的。我希望法院這邊能幫我調出兩個監視器畫面以查看當天的情況。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the CCTV cameras.

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
You mean that there are CCTVs in your community, and you’d like to ask the court to find the clips at the time?Can you give us the timing more specifically so that we can know what is the timing of the CCTV clips?

I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
我記得我當天是在大約晚上7點40分下樓的，我以我希望法院這邊能夠幫我調出七點三十到八點十分的監視器畫面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我希望法院這邊能夠幫我調出七點三十到八點十分的監視器畫面。'

檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
Prosecutor, do you have any opinion about the fact that the accused is going to find the CCTV Clips at that day?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the fact that the prosecutor is being asked for their opinion.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. It should be 'about the fact that' instead of 'about that fact that'.

沒有意見。
No, I do not.

今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？
And today’s preparatory procedure will end here.The next court will set at 2:30 p.m. August 8th 2020.And next time we’re going to examine the CCTV clips at the day when the incident happened. Also, we’ll ask both party to have your statement.Prosecutor and accused, do you have any questions.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'And today’s preparatory procedure will end here' is incorrect. It should be 'Today's preparatory procedure will end here.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense in the sentence 'The next court will set at 2:30 p.m. August 8th 2020' is incorrect. It should be 'The next court is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. on August 8th, 2020.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about reviewing the surveillance video content and asking for statements from both parties.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds the phrase 'at the day when the incident happened,' which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting or misrepresenting culturally specific concepts	The user's translation does not include the specific term '庭檢閱' (reviewing in court) which is a culturally specific concept in the legal context.

沒有。
No, I rest.

No.
沒有，謝謝。

那今天開庭到此結束，請在簽完筆錄後離席，謝謝。
And the court is dismissed. After singing up the record, you can leave.

如起訴書所載。
As stated in the indictment.

被告Steven Knox於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在其自家門口 （地址為：新北市板橋區長江路 23號6樓），因其摩托車被挪動而與鄰居（即告訴人）發生口角，進而產生肢體衝突。經告訴人至醫院驗傷，醫師診斷為手臂、身體多處挫傷、瘀青，後被提告。檢察官起訴被告違反刑法375條之傷害罪，被告做何答辯？
This incident took place at 7:50 pm on June 18th, 2020. The location is in front of the defendant’s house, which the address is 6th floor, No.23 ChangJiang Street Banqiao District, New Taipei City. The defendant’s motorcycle was moved, and he had some arguments and quarrels with his neighbor, which is the accuser, and caused physical confrontation. After the accuser went to the hospital for medical examination, the doctors that he had… he had many bruises on his arms and body parts. According to the Criminal Law No.375, the accused has constituted attack. The defendant, what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The location is in front of the defendant’s house, which the address is 6th floor, No.23 ChangJiang Street Banqiao District, New Taipei City' is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'The location, which is the 6th floor, No.23 ChangJiang Street Banqiao District, New Taipei City, is in front of the defendant’s house.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence 'The defendant’s motorcycle was moved, and he had some arguments and quarrels with his neighbor, which is the accuser, and caused physical confrontation.' The correct verb form should be 'caused' instead of 'cause' to match the subject 'he'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the details of the accuser going to the hospital for medical examination and the diagnosis of bruises on his arms and body parts.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user's translation adds unnecessary information about the Criminal Law No.375. This information is not present in the original text.

I plead not guilty.
無罪答辯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '答辩无罪'.

今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
Today we are here for a preparatory procedure. I will now first offer some evidence. The prosecutor and the defendant can add more details to the evidence offered. For today’s procedure, the defendant did not hire a lawyer, so he will speak on his own behalf. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
Prosecutor, please show the evidence and ask your questions.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'Prosecutor' at the end of the sentence instead of the beginning.

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The defendant, the incident happened at 7:50 pm on June 18th, 2020 in front of your door. You had a quarrel with your neighbor about moving your motorcycle. At first it was only a little argument, but it became physical confrontation. The first evidence is as stated in page 8 investigatory file. It is the statements made at the police station. As stated in the statements made at the police station, you said that you went home on that day at 6:30 pm. You parked your car and then went home. After that you were having dinner, then you looked downstairs and saw someone moving your motorcycle, so you went downstairs to take a look at what was happening. When you went downstairs, you found out the one who was moving your motorcycle was your neighbor, Da-Ming Chang, which is the accuser. He was moving your motorcycle. You asked the accuser why did he move your motorcycle. The accuser answered that because your motorcycle was blocking his car, and you shouldn’t park your motorcycle at that place, so he moved your motorcycle. Because you disagreed with his statement, so you had quarrels with him, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'At first it was only a little argument, but it became physical confrontation.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'The defendant, the incident happened at 7:50 pm on June 18th, 2020 in front of your door.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Misinterpretation of the phrase '挪動摩托車' as 'moving your motorcycle' instead of 'moving the motorcycle'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the argument and confrontation were a result of the neighbor moving the defendant's motorcycle.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the defendant disagreed with the neighbor's statement about moving the motorcycle.

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
是的，基本上那就是事發經過。我想要強調這不是第一次我們因為我的摩托車停放位置吵架。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們因為我的摩托車停放位置吵架' instead of '我們吵架因為我的摩托車停放位置'.

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
Do you mean that both parties have already had arguments about where the motorcycle is parked before?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我在這個社區已經住了八個月了，告訴人他已經多次嘗試移動我的摩托車。他只是不滿和看不慣我把車子停在那裏。這個社區的所有住戶都有權利可以在這個停車場停放自己的汽車或機車，只要有空位。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '告訴人他已經多次嘗試移動我的摩托車' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '告訴人多次嘗試移動我的摩托車'.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever been to the police station to report cases about these kinds of arguments?

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
之前發生口角的時候我都會盡量避免肢體衝突。有時候我甚至不會在乎他移動我的摩托車，有時候我會假裝沒有看到。回答剛才的問題，我沒有去警局備過案，但其他鄰居有相似的經驗。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '之前發生口角的時候我都會盡量避免肢體衝突' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我都會盡量避免肢體衝突之前發生口角的時候'.

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
In your community, do the motorcycles have their own specific parking slot?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of a specific parking slot for motorcycles.

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有，我們基本上是只要有空位就可以停。基本上是採先到先有的制度。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So about the parking of the motorcycle, everyone can park his or her own motorcycle if there is an empty space, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'everyone' should be followed by the singular verb 'can park', not 'can park'

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
是的，只要有空位任何人都可以停放他的機車。

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Is there a parking slot at where you park your motorcycle?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is there a parking slot where you park your motorcycle?'

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
是的，市政府已經有劃分十個特定的機車空位給我們停放。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '市政府已經為機車劃分了十個特定的停車位。'

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
According to the investigatory file page number 24’s picture. In the defendant’s community, the parking spaces for motorcycles indeed have parking slots. The defendant, please check this picture.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，照片上的確是我社區裡面給摩托車停放的停車格。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'neighborhood' in their translation.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
Then how did the arguments you had that day evolve into physical confrontation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
那天我在樓上看到有人在樓下移動我的機車，所以我就趕下樓看發生什麼事。就像我說的，這已經不是第一次有人移動我的摩托車。那天晚上我就是感覺不想再忍受這樣的事情了。當我下樓時我看到告訴人他雙手緊抓著我的把手。我問他在幹嘛，但他沒有回答我，於是我上前阻擋他的去路。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '那天我在樓上看到有人在樓下移動我的機車' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '那天我在樓上看到有人在樓下移動我的機車'.

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
Do you mean that he was trying to move your motorcycle, and you stepped forward to try to block him, so there was some push and pull between you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using 'push and pull' instead of 'pushing and shoving'.

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
是的，當我試著想要用雙手我摩托車的把手，他卻沒有放手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'hold' should come before the object 'handlebars'.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Then do you remember who started the fight first?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得是我先想要把他的手推開。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
According to the investigatory file page number 8, there are the statements made at the police station. According the tenth line on page 9, the accuser held on the handlebars very tightly, and tried to move away your motorcycle, so you went forward and tried to push away his hands. You just mentioned that you attacked first, did you mean this move?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the accuser grabbing the motorcycle handlebars tightly.

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
是的，這就是我在警局筆錄裡所陳述的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這就是我在警局筆錄裡所陳述的。'

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
After you pushed away his hands, what was the other party’s reaction?

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他沒有因此放手，反而他更用力的握住把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb phrase '握住把手' should come before the adverbial phrase '更用力的'.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
So you mean that the accuser did not let go of the handlebars, but instead grabbed it more tightly, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using 'accuser' instead of 'opposite party'.

Yes.
是的沒錯。

接下來發生什麼事呢？
Then after that, what happened?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific event or action that occurred after the mentioned event.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
因為他的肢體語言告訴我他不會放開我的把手，所以我就推了一下他的肩膀，想要讓他放手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為他的肢體語言告訴我，我推了一下他的肩膀，希望他能放開把手。'

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
So you pushed his shoulder, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我推了他的肩膀。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我推了他的肩膀' instead of '我推了他的肩膀。'

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Then do you think that you pushed his shoulder with much force?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，在我記憶中我只是輕輕推了他的肩膀一下。就像有時候我們希望對方停止動作的時候的輕推。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions a 'gentle push' while the user's translation mentions '輕輕推了他的肩膀一下' which means 'gently pushed his shoulder once'. The user's translation does not capture the idea of pushing someone to do or not do something.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
Next we are going to show the 48th page on investigatory file 1. This is a medical receipt according to the Capital United Hospital. In the hospitalization, the accuser’s body and arms had many injuries and bruises. How did that occur, was it because you pushed him?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user incorrectly translated '提示偵券' as 'investigatory file' instead of 'medical receipt'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'Next' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'According to'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the doctor's diagnosis in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the cause of the injuries in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the accuser in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the multiple injuries and bruises in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question of whether the assistant caused the injuries in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the assistant's denial of causing the injuries in the translation

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我完全不知道那些擦傷還有瘀青是怎麼來的，那不是我造成的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我完全不知道那些擦傷還有瘀青是怎麼來的，那不是我造成的。'

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there anyone who can prove your statements of what you just said? Or about what happened that night?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Can anyone confirm what you just said about the situation that night?'

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
當天我的女朋友也在我家，他知道我要下樓查看，他也非常清楚我和我鄰居之前有過這樣的爭執。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be changed to 'was' to match the past tense of the sentence.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
Do you mean that your girlfriend saw what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
他在我們爭執的時候就下樓了。他非常堅持要用手機錄下視頻，以便之後需要。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他在我們爭執的時候就下樓了。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'intended' is translated as '非常堅持要', which means 'insist on' instead of 'intend'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the part 'just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened'.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
More specifically speaking, when did your girlfriend arrive at the scene and tried to film?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
他下樓的時候我正第一次試圖要抓住我摩托車的把手
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she successfully film the process of your quarre
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，正當他要把手機拿出來錄影的時候，告訴人告訴他不要這麼做，但告訴人沒有權利制止他。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning by stating that the plaintiff warned the person not to record, instead of warning the person not to take out her cell phone.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order, resulting in a confusing sentence structure.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the plaintiff's lack of right to tell the person not to take out her cell phone.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
Then I have no further questions.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The defendant, today is a preliminary preparatory procedure. Before the next court, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate on your behalf?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
有的，我想要請法院查看並調閱那兩個監視器畫面查看當天的事發經過。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb '查看' (to view) should come before the noun phrase '那兩個監視器畫面' (the two CCTV camera footage).

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
Do you mean that there are CCTVs placed in your community, and you hope we can retrieve the CCTV clip and take a look? If that is true, can you please say where and when you want us to take a look on the CCTV clip? Can you offer a more specific time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific location in the community where the CCTVs are placed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not provide a specific time for when they want to review the CCTV clip.

I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
我下樓的時候大概是晚上7:40，所以我希望法院可以調閱7:30到8:10的錄影帶。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我希望法院可以調閱7:30到8:10的錄影帶，因為我下樓的時候大概是晚上7:40。'

檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
Prosecutor, do you have anything to add on what the defendant asked for retrieving the CCTV clip?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the prosecutor's opinion.

沒有意見。
I have nothing to add.

今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of reviewing the case in the next court session.

沒有。
No, I rest.

No.
沒有，謝謝。

那今天開庭到此結束，請在簽完筆錄後離席，謝謝。
The court is dismissed, please sign the court records and you may leave.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'please sign the court records and then you may leave.'

semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits important details from the original text.

I plead not guilty.
無罪答辯
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '答辯無罪'.

今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
Today the court will provide the part of the evidence and the prosecutor and the defendant, if you have any opinion, both of you can reflect. In this procedure, the accuser did not hire a lawyer. So he will speak for himself. Do you understand.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

了解。
 Yes, I do.

I understand.
是的，我也了解

請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
Prosecutor. Please provide the evidence and ask the questions.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'Prosecutor' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'Prosecutor' at the end of the sentence instead of the beginning, resulting in a word order error.

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The defendant. At 7:50 p.m. on June 18th 2020. In front of your house, you had an argument and which leads to a physical confrontation with your neighbor because of your motorcycle was moved. The first evidence is showed on the trial list page 8 which is the record in the police.According to your record, you got back home at 6:30 pm and then you park your motorcycle in front of your house. And you went up stair. After that, you finished your dinner. And then you saw someone down stair is moving your motorcycle. Then you asked 大明張 why would he move your motorcycle. And he answered that your motorbike was blocked his car. And you should’ve not park your motorbike in that place.Because you cannot agree with his response, so you started the argument right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'And you went up stair.' It should be 'And then you went up the stairs.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'And then you saw someone down stair is moving your motorcycle.' It should be 'And then you saw someone downstairs moving your motorcycle.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'And you should’ve not park your motorbike in that place.' It should be 'And you should not have parked your motorbike in that place.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence 'Because you cannot agree with his response, so you started the argument right?' It should be 'Because you disagreed with his response, you started the argument, right?'

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
是的，基本上就是這樣沒錯，但我只想再次強調，這不是我們第一次為了停車糾紛而有發生口角過
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the motorbike in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
So you mean this is not the first time had an argument about the parking place of your motorbike?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我在這個社區至少住了八個月以上，在這段期間，告訴人一直試圖的想要移動我的摩托車，他只是看不慣我把摩托車停在那個位子，但他並沒有任何正當理由，任何人住在那個社區都有權利把他們的交通工具停在那個位子，只要它是空的
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '告訴人一直試圖的想要移動我的摩托車' should be '告訴人一直試圖想要移動我的摩托車'.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever made a statement at police station because of some argument alike?

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
之前有過口角的時候，我都盡量避開衝突，有時我會假裝沒看到，或者是不去在意我的摩托車被移動，至於是否有到警察局做筆錄，我的回答是沒有的，但是鄰居也有相關的經驗
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
Is there any regular parking slot in your community?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
並沒有，我們並沒有固定的停車格，只要有位子，縣道的人就能將車子停放在那裏。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that parking can be done in any empty spot, while the user's translation suggests that there are no fixed parking spaces.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So you can park anywhere available if you see any parking slot.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'if you see any available parking slot, you can park anywhere.'

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
沒錯，只要停車格是空的，那麼他們都能將他的摩托車或汽車停放在那
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'anyone' should be followed by 'can park' instead of 'can park his/her'.

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
Are the parking slot has……
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
有的，政府有在那附近畫了十幾個停車格
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation incorrectly refers to '停車格' (parking spaces) instead of 'designated parking spaces for motorcycles'.

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
According to the investigatory record one, you can check and confirm the defendant motorbike was parked at the parking slot.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the photo and the fact that it was shown in the record.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的沒錯 照片當中那些的確是機車停車格
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
And why the quarrel leads to a physical confrontation at that day
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我發現我的機車正在被移動時，我利馬衝下樓查看是怎麼一回事，如同我剛剛所說，這不是第一次有人移動我的摩托車了，而剛好在那天下午我不想再忍受了，當我下樓查看時，告訴人的雙手放在把手上移動著它，我也問他他在做甚麼他卻不回答，所以我走向前
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of the motorbike.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added unnecessary information about not wanting to tolerate the matter anymore.

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
So the confrontation happened because you want to stop him from moving your motorbike
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
null
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker tried to hold the handlebars of their motorcycle.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Do you remember who started the confrontation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得是我想將他的手從把手上移開
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. 'I believe I tried to push his hands away' suggests uncertainty, while '我記得是我想將他的手從把手上移開' implies a definite memory of the action.

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
Check and confirm the investigatory record of the statement made at the police station. At page nine line ten. The record says that the accuser grabs your motorbike tightly and don’t want let go, so you try to remove his hand from your motorbike. So you said that you started the confrontation which indicate this movement
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the police questioning and focused only on the confrontation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'don't' instead of 'doesn't' to agree with the singular subject 'accuser'.

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
是的，這就是我自筆錄當中提到我在衝突發生後所做的事
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
What’s the reaction of the accuser when you try to remove his hand from your motorbike?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about the accuser's hand being on the motorbike.

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他並沒有移開，相反的他更用力的掐握著我的摩托車
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他並沒有移開，相反地他更用力地掐握著我的摩托車。'

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
So the accuser did not remove his hand from your motorbike. Instead, he grabs your motorbike even more tightly
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes.
是的沒錯

接下來發生什麼事呢？
Then what happened next?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'Then' at the beginning of the sentence, which is an important detail in the original text.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
從他的肢體上看來他並沒有想要放開我的摩托車，所以我推了他的肩膀，希望他可以離開我的摩托車
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因此我推了他的肩膀'.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
So you push his shoulder because you want him to leave your motorbike?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我推了他的肩膀
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我推了他的肩膀' instead of '我推了他的肩膀'.

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Do you push his should with much force at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you push his shoulder with much force at that time?'

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
我並沒有推他推的很大力，我大概就是以平常要別人不做甚麼事情的那種力道
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
Let’s check and confirm the investigatory record one on page 48. This is the result of 聯合hospital. In the diagnose record. It shows that accuser’s arm and multiple body part have bruises and injuries. Are these injuries caused by the push?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'investigatory' is used instead of 'medical' or 'diagnostic'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'Let's check and confirm the medical record on page 48.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the city hospital.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the doctor's diagnosis.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the cause of the injuries.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the accuser's body.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the bruises and injuries being in multiple places.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the accuser's arm being one of the injured body parts.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the injuries being bruises and contusions.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the injuries possibly being caused by a push.

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我完全不曉得這些淤青和挫傷是怎麼造成的，這不是我做的阿
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我完全不曉得這些淤青和挫傷是怎麼造成的，這不是我做的阿'.

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
Is there any one can prove your statement or what happened at that time.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
那個時候我的女友正在家中，她知道我要下樓去查看，也知道我和那位鄰居發生的事
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '那個時候我正在家中，我的女友知道我要下樓去查看，也知道我和那位鄰居發生的事。'

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
So your girlfriend witness what happened at that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
我女友下來察看時,衝突已經開始了，她有拿出手機來拍攝下這些過程，以方之後我們有需要證據來證明
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她下來察看時'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'in the middle of the confrontation' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened' in the translation.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
To be more precisely, when did your girlfriend went down stair and took out her phone and film this incident?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'When did your girlfriend go down the stairs and take out her phone to film this incident?'

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
她下來時，我正好要將伸手握取機車把手
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我正好要将手伸出去抓住摩托车的把手' to maintain the same meaning as the original text.

後來她有拍成功嗎？
Did she film the scene successfully?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有 正當我女友拿出手機拍時，告訴人就制止她，但他並沒有任何權力這麼做
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '拍' (to take a photo) should be conjugated to match the subject '我女友' (my girlfriend).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the plaintiff warning the girlfriend not to use her cell phone.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
There’s no further question.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
The accused. Today is the preliminarily preparatory procedure. Is there any evidence that you would like to ask the court to investigate for you for the next court?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
是的，我想要請法院調閱出當天在那附近兩台監視器的畫面
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific request to look into the clips taken by the CCTV cameras.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在那附近' (nearby) in the wrong position in the sentence.

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
So you want us to check the two CCTV in your community? So could you tell the court more precisely about which area should we check?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
我是大約在7:40的時候下樓的，所以我希望法院可以調閱7:30分到8:10這段時間的影像
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我是大約在7:40的時候下樓的，所以我希望法院可以調閱7:30分到8:10這段時間的影像。'

檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
Prosecutor, do you have anything to add about the defendant want to check the CCTV?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the opinion of the prosecutor.

沒有意見。
No

今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？

今天告訴人因病向法院請假，因此今天的程序會先跟被告釐清當天的狀況，明白嗎?
The accuser take a sick leave, so we will ask the accused of what happened on that day.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I understand.
是的，我了解。

請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
Prosecutor, please state the crime
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the key information of the prosecutor's statement.

如起訴書所載。
As stated in the indictment.

被告Steven Knox於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在其自家門口 （地址為：新北市板橋區長江路 23號6樓），因其摩托車被挪動而與鄰居（即告訴人）發生口角，進而產生肢體衝突。經告訴人至醫院驗傷，醫師診斷為手臂、身體多處挫傷、瘀青，後被提告。檢察官起訴被告違反刑法375條之傷害罪，被告做何答辯？
 The incident happened at 7:50 pm on June 18, 2020 and the incident took place in front of the accused’s house, the address is 6 Floor, No.23 Changjiang Road, Banqiao District, New Taipei City. On that day, the motorcycle of the accused was moved, so the accused have some quarrel with his neighborhood, the accuser, and then have physical confrontation. After the accuser went to the hospital, the doctor said that there are many bruises and scratches on the accuser’s arm, so the accuser was going to sue the accused. And according to the Criminal Law No.375, the accused violated the attack. What’s your plea?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	address is not translated correctly
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	the accused's motorcycle was moved, not the motorcycle of the accused
omission or addition	omitting important details	the accused's motorcycle was moved by someone else, important detail is missing

I plead not guilty.
我無罪答辯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我答辯無罪。'

今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
Today is the preparatory procedure, so we will show some evidence first. Prosecutor and the accused, you can add anything you want to say for the evidence. Today the accused didn’t apply a lawyer, so he will state by himself. For the procedure, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Today the accused didn’t apply a lawyer, so he will state by himself.' The correct word order should be: 'Today the accused didn’t apply for a lawyer, so he will state by himself.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the court showing evidence first in the original text.

了解。
Yes, I do.

I understand.
我也了解。

請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
Prosecutor, please show the evidence and ask.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'evidence' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'ask' before the subject 'Prosecutor', resulting in incorrect word order.

被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
The defendant, at the time of 7:50 pm, June 18, 2020, you had a quarrel and physical confrontation with your neighborhood in front of your house because of the move of your motorcycle. In the investigatory record 1 page 8, on that page there is the statement made at the police station. As the statement stated, you said that you went home at 6:30. After you parked your motorcycle, you went upstairs. After you finished, you looked down from the window and see someone wanted to move your motorcycle. After you went down and checked, you found that your neighborhood, Da Ming Chang, was moving your motorcycle. You asked the accuser why he moved your motorcycle and he replied that your motorcycle was obstacle, and you shouldn’t park at that place. Because you can not accept his statement, so you have argument, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'As the statement stated, you said that you went home at 6:30.' The correct word order should be: 'You said in the statement that you went home at 6:30.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'After you finished, you looked down from the window and see someone wanted to move your motorcycle.' The correct form should be: 'After you finished, you looked down from the window and saw someone wanted to move your motorcycle.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence: 'You asked the accuser why he moved your motorcycle and he replied that your motorcycle was obstacle.' The correct form should be: 'You asked the accuser why he moved your motorcycle and he replied that your motorcycle was blocking his vehicle.'

Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
我只是想強調這已經不是第一次為了停車的事情吵架。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
So you mean that it was not the first time that you have argument with each other because of the parking place of the motorcycle.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
我住在那個社區八個月了，告訴人不只一次的想要移動我的機車，而且都沒有原因。他不喜歡我把我把我的車子停在那哩，但已經沒有其他可以停的地方了。如果有空位的話，社區的每個人都有權利把他們的交通工具停在那個地方，如果有空位的話。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '告訴人不只一次的想要移動我的機車' should be '不只一次的告訴人想要移動我的機車'.

以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
Have you ever reported to the police about this condition.

When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences.
之前發生口角，我都會避免肢體衝突，有時候我並不在意他移動我的車，我甚至會假裝沒發生過這件事。回到你的問題，我並沒有去警察局備案過，但其他鄰居也有發生過類似的經驗。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "之前發生口角" is incorrect. It should be "口角之前發生".
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "我並沒有去警察局備案過" is incorrect. It should be "我沒有去警察局備案過".

在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
Are there available parking spaces in your community?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis.
沒有固定的位子，只要有空位就可以停，通常是只要有車位，你就可以先停進去。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about parking being on a first-come-first-serve basis.

所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
So you mean that about the issue parking of motorcycle, everyone can park their motorcycle if there are empty spaces.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
 對，只要有空位，每個人都可以停在那裏。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'anyone' requires the singular verb 'can park' instead of 'can park'

那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
In your community, are there any parking slots with lines?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
沒錯，市政府有在我們的社區裡劃很多停車格。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions designated parking spaces for motorcycles, but the user's translation refers to parking spaces in general.

提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
According to the investigatory record 1 page 24, and there is a photo, the photo shows that in the community, there actually parking slots. The defendant, please make sure of it.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '有畫停車格' as 'there actually parking slots' instead of 'there are painted parking spaces'.

 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
是的，照片裡的停車格是讓摩托車停的。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation incorrectly refers to the parking slots as '停車格' instead of '停車位', which is the more commonly used term in Chinese.

那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
What’s your reason that your argument evolved into physical confrontation on that day?

When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
當我在樓上看到有人想移動我的摩托車時，我立刻衝了下去。就像我說的，這已經不是第一次，我已經沒辦法再容忍這樣的事情發生了。當我下樓的時候，我看到告訴人正在抓著我摩托車的把手，我問他在做什麼，但他沒有回答，所以我向前想要把我的摩托車拿回來。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '當我在樓上看到有人想移動我的摩托車時' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我看到有人想移動我的摩托車時在樓上'.

所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
You mean that the accuser was moving your motorcycle, and you stepped forward to stop him so you have some physical confrontation like pushing, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the accuser was moving the motorcycle, while the original text does not mention who was moving the motorcycle.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
是的，當我上前試著抓住我的把手，但他卻緊握著不放
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當我試著抓住我的把手' instead of '當我上前試著抓住我的把手'.

你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
Do you remember who is the first one to hit the other party?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be changed to 'was' to match the past tense of the sentence.

I believe I tried to push his hands away.
我記得是我想把他的手挪開我的把手。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of 'pushing his hands away,' the user's translation states 'I wanted to move his hands away from my hands.'

提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
I’m going to show you the questioning statement in police station on the investigatory record 1 page 8. On the page 9 line10, you said the accuser grabbed your handlebar tightly. And he insist to move your motorcycle, so stepped forward to remove his hands. As what you mentioned, you said that you have the physical action first, do the mean the action is removing his hands?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the police questioning statement in their translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '警局訊問記錄' as 'questioning statement in police station' instead of 'police questioning statement'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect in the sentence 'As what you mentioned, you said that you have the physical action first, do the mean the action is removing his hands?' It should be 'As you mentioned, you said that you took the physical action first, does that mean the action is removing his hands?'

Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
對，這是在事件發生後我到警局作的筆錄。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
After you remove the other party’s hands, what was his interaction

He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
他不但沒有把他的手移開，還更用力把我的把手抓得更緊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
You mean that the accuser grabbed your handlebar tightly instead of removing his hand?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes.
是的。

接下來發生什麼事呢？
Then what happened next?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'Then' at the beginning of the sentence, which is an important detail in the original text.

Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
從他的肢體動作，可以看到他是完全沒有想放開我的摩托車，所以我推了他肩膀，希望他可以放開我的把手。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我推了他的肩膀'.

因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
So you pushed his shoulder because of this?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
是的，我推了他的肩膀
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我推了他的肩膀' instead of '是的，我推了他的肩膀'.

你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
Did you push his shoulder with much force?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '當時你有很用力嗎？' as 'Did you push his shoulder with much force?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks 'Did you feel like you were putting in a lot of effort at that time?'

No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
沒有，我只是輕輕推一下，就像我們平常要制止別人時推他的力道一
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
 I’m going to show the investigatory record 1 page 48. There is a medical report from the United Hospital. In the medical report, there were many hurts and bruises on the accuser’s body and arms. Is that caused by your pushing?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '提示偵券' as 'investigatory record' instead of 'court summons'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '1 page 48' in the wrong position in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the medical report is a diagnosis certificate from the doctor.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the injuries were caused by an incident, not necessarily by the assistant's pushing.

I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
我不知道為什麼他身上會有那些挫傷和瘀青，我並沒有做。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation changes the meaning of 'bruises or injuries' to '挫傷和瘀青', which specifically refers to bruises and contusions, but not necessarily injuries.

有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
If there anyone can be your witness of the content you state and what happened that day?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is there anyone who can confirm...' instead of 'If there anyone can confirm...'

My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor.
那天晚上，我女朋友在我家，他知道我下樓查看這件事，而且他也知道我和告訴人已經有很多次口角了。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'know' should agree with the subject 'girlfriend', so it should be 'she knows' instead of 'he knows'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the history between me and that neighbor' is translated as '已經有很多次口角了', which means 'have had many arguments' instead of 'history'.

你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
Do you mean that your girlfriend is a witness of the incident?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
我女朋友那時候也下樓，並且在我們爭執時想錄下影片，就是為了可以讓影片當成證據。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '那時候也下樓' instead of '我女朋友那時候也下樓'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'She came down' is not accurately conveyed in the translation. The phrase '我女朋友那時候也下樓' translates to 'My girlfriend also came downstairs at that time'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'the middle of the confrontation', which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened', which is an important detail in the original text.

準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
Certainly, when did your girlfriend arrive at the scene, and try to film what happened?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question.

She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
她在我第一次想要奪回把手時抵達現場。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'grab the handlebars'.

後來她有拍成功嗎？
So did she successfully film?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
沒有，正當我的女友要錄影時，告訴人警告她不准這麼做，但她並沒有權力制止我女朋友。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

那我的問題先問到這裡。
Then my question ends here.

今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
Today is the preliminary preparatory procedure, before the next court, do you need any evidence that need the court to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day.
 是，我想要求法院調閱那天兩台監視器的畫面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb '調閱' should come before the object '那天兩台監視器的畫面'.

你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
Do you mean that there are CCTVs in the intersection of your community, so you want us to get those clips from it, right? If the answer is yes, can you provide certain time for us so we can request the clips more easily.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
我是在7:40分下樓的，我希望能調閱7:30到8:10的監視器畫面。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我是在7:40分下樓的，我希望能調閱7:30到8:10的監視器畫面。'

檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
Prosecutor, do you want to add anything for the request from the accused of asking the CCTV clips?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the response from the prosecutor.

沒有意見。
No.

今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？
Today’s court for preparatory procedure is dismissed. The date of the next court is set at 2:30 pm on August 8, 2020. On the next court, we will check the CCTV clips and ask the both parties more details on that day. Prosecutor and the accused, do you have anything to add?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of reviewing the case in the next court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of asking for opinions from both parties.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'we will check' instead of 'we will review' the CCTV clips.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used 'is set' instead of 'has been scheduled'.
grammar and structure	preposition errors	The user used 'on' instead of 'at' to indicate the time.

沒有。
No, I rest.

No.
沒有。

那今天開庭到此結束，請在簽完筆錄後離席，謝謝。
The court is dismissed. Please sign the record before you leave.

今天我們要辦理的是林熙蕾和Tim離婚的準備程序。雙方都有律師嗎？
Today’s we;re here for the divorce case, perjury, preparatory procedure for divorce case. Did both parties have lawyers to represent both yourself?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	perjury instead of preparatory

是的，我請律師代表我。
Yes, I have asked a lawyer to represent myself.

I'm still looking for my lawyer, so I'll be representing myself today.
我還沒找到委託律師，所以今天由我自己回答。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'looking' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

在今天的程序中，我會先詢問告訴人離婚的原因，然後再詢問被告的感受。如果被告不願意離婚，您的主要原因是什麼？清楚知道流程嗎？
In today’s procedure, I’ll ask the expresser for the main reason of divorce, and ask the pther party. And ask the reason for the other party why he don't want to divorce.

我和老公結婚3年了，但是年齡差距太大了，大約有30歲。以前我們談戀愛的時候，我不知道我們有很多價值觀不匹配，所以結婚後，我發現我一點也不幸福。我平時和老公溝通不好，而且他對一切都高度懷疑。他總是以關心的名義詢問我去了哪裡，遇見了誰。一開始我以為是他的關心，但隨著時間的推移，我覺得他越來越認真了。關於關心我。比如說，如果我告訴他我要去崇光百貨，但我帶著清風廣場的包回來後，他就會生氣，問很多關於我的事情。有時候，我不想解釋，但情況卻變得更糟。這種情況從我們結婚之初就開始了。我真的厭倦了這個。另外，我的丈夫是法國人，我的家人都不會說法語，所以我的家人都無法與他交談。雖然我不和家人住在一起，但每逢節假日或特殊場合，我們都會聚在一起。我病了好幾天，所以我媽媽來我家照顧我。由於語言障礙，我丈夫和我母親發生了很多衝突。我在他們之間做了很長一段時間的中間人，我覺得厭倦了，所以我想提出離婚。
I’ve been married for 3 years, but I want to divorce because the gap in age and we about 20 days. When we were in relationship, I didn’t find out  that our values are different. But after marriage, I didn’t feel happy. We didn’t have a great communication with each other for many times, and he is highly suspicious. He often ask me where I go to and who I’m with in the name of concern. At first, I though he just concern me, but he got more and more suspicious. For example, if I told him I will go to, went to Sogo at Shihlin, but i went back home with the shopping bag with breeze plaza, he will ask for me a lot of questions and got angry. Sometime, I didn’t want to explain, the situation gets worse. when I come home I carry merchandise of breeze plaza, then he will ask for many things and sometimes he get angry. Sometimes, I don’t wat to explain, and the situations gets worse. Such a situation begins when we got married, and I felt exhausted. Moreover, my husband is France; however, my parents cannot speak French, so they cannot also communicate with him. families don’t speak French. Therefore, they cannot communicate at all. Although I separate with my parents, we get together on holidays or special occasions. I was sick before, so my mom take care of me, and my mom have language barrier, so they have some conflicts between themselves. I felt tired to be the middleman so I want to divorce.

我承認我前陣子確實和岳母有一些爭執，但我們會吵是因為他想要跟我們待再一起，但我先前沒有預想到全部的人會住在一起。我尊重我的岳母是因為我知道中國人都很尊重家庭，也很孝順。至於我會想了解說我太太去哪裡，我只是單純的關心她。她身心不太好，他有精神疾病，也會去看精神科。

一般來說，在正常的離婚案件中，在台灣人看來，我們希望勸說夫妻繼續在一起，而不是尋求離婚。雙方都想進行婚姻諮詢嗎？婚姻諮詢師的主要角色和職責是找出你婚姻中的問題。也許我們可以通過婚姻顧問來幫助您的婚姻。如果根本不工作，你已經盡力了，你會考慮嗎？
Generally Chinese or Taiwanese try to persuade couples to stay together in a relationship rather than seek a divorce in this kind of situation. Do both party consider for marriage consultant?

我曾向丈夫建議過這種方法，但他沒有接受。他堅持認為婚姻是我們自己的事，我們沒有別人的幫助。既然他都這麼說了，我也無能為力。如果jhonor有能力說服他進行婚姻諮詢，我想嘗試一下。

I don't mind if my wife wants a marriage counselor, but if we scold him for doing that, will my wife stop looking for her ex-boyfriend? That guy treated her badly, that guy was only interested in our money.
如果這是我太太的想法的話，那我不介意去進行婚姻諮商。但如果我們真的去進行婚姻諮商，我希望我的太太可以不要再去找前男友。那個難的不是真的愛他，他只是覬覦她或是我們的錢。

等等，你的意思是你妻子的婚姻有問題嗎？還有一個男朋友嗎？
Wait a minute, do you suspect she has a extra marital affair?

Yes, that guy was his ex-boyfriend, and he kept seeing his ex-boyfriend even after we got married.

告訴人，您對此有何看法？
The expresser, what do you think?

這就是為什麼我說他對一切都持懷疑態度。他確實對一切都抱有很高的懷疑態度。他提到的男性朋友只是我最好的朋友之一。當一個人心情不好的時候，總是想和一些朋友聊聊，我也是。但我的丈夫總是把我和朋友的聊天當作家庭醜聞。他對我的朋友不友好。他不能，因為我有一個男性朋友然後認為我有婚外情。
This is why I mention my husband is highly suspicious of my ex boyfriend. He just mention that the male friend is just my good friend. When a person are in a bad mood, he or she would want to have a person to talk with, and I’m no acception. But my husband think that I talk with my friend is to show the family scandal. He treat my friends badly, but he cannot say that I have a extra marital affair with him.

我的意見是雙方都可以寫下自己對對方原來的看法。告訴人，你要知道，被告在國外有婚姻，在台灣，所以他可能為了你們的婚姻付出了很大的努力。你剛才說你和你丈夫的年齡差距很大，所以。你剛才提到你心情不好的時候總是和你的朋友聊天，我可以理解。這一部分我覺得你應該聽取意見，和你老公有個概念。
I suggest that both party can put down the stereotype. The expresser, you have to know that the other party leave his own country and come to here, so he may emphasize on this relationship, put more attention on this relationship. You mentioned that you have a gap in marriage, so you may know that when he has insecurity. I can understand that you wnat to talk with your friend when you are in a bad mood. However, you should get confirmation from your husband, or the situation will get worse.

是的我明白。
Yes, I understand.

被告，我知道你很愛你的妻子。但如果你愛一個人，就不要每天都懷疑她。就像她剛才說的，他出去的時候，你總是問他，問她很多問題，懷疑他有別的男朋友了。這種態度無法維持健康的婚姻。你必須明白，信任是婚姻的基礎。你必須明白它的重要性。
The other party, I know you still love your wife, but you cannot be high suspicious of him of her. He just mentioned that you may ask her many questions when she go out, and suspect of his male friends, so both of you cannot be happy in this marriage. You must know that confidence lay foundation of marriage.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect interpretation of the original text

I get it, I'll give it a try.
我了解了，我會試著信任他。

看來雙方都不太願意進行婚姻諮詢，您將此案轉至婚姻諮詢中心看看我們是否能得到進一步的幫助。不得不提的是，因為你們都接受婚姻諮詢，所以你們必須一起去婚姻諮詢，否則這一切都是一句空話。我會給這個案例4個月左右的時間，看看你婚姻諮詢的效果。但我必須給你一個意見：婚姻根本不是一件容易的事。大家都知道，相聚容易，共處難。所以，如果你們已經結婚了，就繼續在一起吧。雙方都明白嗎？
Since both party are willing to have marriage counseling,  the case will transfer to the marriage counseling center, and see if they can solve this problem. Both the party accpet this method, so you have to go to marriage counsleing center together, otherwise the problem cannot be solved. And I will give this case for four months and see what’s the effect of marriage counsel. But I have to tell both party that marrigae is not easy, it’s not easy to maintain a marriage. Everyone knows taht it is easy to love each other, but it is hard to get along with each other. So since get marriage, you have to maintain this marriage. Do both party fully understand?

But as time goes on, his behavior is getting more and more serious. For instance, if I told him I was going to Sogo in Shihlin District, but when I come home I carry merchandise of breeze plaza, then he will ask for many things and sometimes he get angry. Sometimes, I don’t wat to explain, and the situations gets worse. Such a situation happened as soon as we get married. I’m very tired of it.

我承認我前陣子和我的岳母有點衝突。原因只是因為他想跟我們住在一起，但是我還沒有習慣他在我們家。我很尊重我岳母，因為我知道家庭觀念對中國人是很重要的。至於，關於我太太剛才說的行蹤的問題，我只能說這就是我表達關心的方法。我太太的身心狀況其實沒有很好，他已經有因為憂鬱症及其他精神疾病去看過心理醫生了。

你的意思是說你的生活出現問題是因為你的妻子有精神疾病吧？
So you mean the problems of your marriage is a result from your wife’s mental and physical condition?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I love her very much and I don't mind her illness, in fact I would love to take care of her. I even found the best doctor in the spiritual field for him, I just want the best care for him. Finding him the best doctor near us and I only hope for the best for her.
我很愛她，我接受他的狀況，而且我也很想照顧她。我甚至在我們附近幫他找了最好的醫生，我只希望能把她照顧的最好。

你剛才提到他去看精神科，心理醫生對他、她的病是怎麼說的？
You mentioned that she has been to psychiatry, what does the doctor say?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '精神科' as 'psychiatry' instead of 'psychologist'.

The doctor said that he had been under great pressure for a long time, so she was easily angry. The doctor said he should go back to the clinic more often so that the psychiatrist can diagnose his condition.
醫生說他長期待在壓力的環境下，那就是為甚麼他很容易動怒。醫生有建議他定期回診，這樣比較好掌控他的情況。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '那就是為甚麼他很容易動怒' is incorrect. It should be '那就是他很容易動怒的原因。'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb '定期回診' should be consistent with the tense used in the original text. It should be 'should go back to the clinic more often' instead of '定期回診'.

你有孩子嗎？

我們沒有小孩。

一般來說，在正常的離婚案件中，在台灣人看來，我們希望勸說夫妻繼續在一起，而不是尋求離婚。雙方都想進行婚姻諮詢嗎？婚姻諮詢師的主要角色和職責是找出你婚姻中的問題。也許我們可以通過婚姻顧問來幫助您的婚姻。如果根本不工作，你已經盡力了，你會考慮嗎？
Well, generally, in the opinion of Chinese people and Taiwanese people, we always try to pursue couples to stay together in a relationship rather than seek a divorce.  Would the both parties consider a marriage counselor?I suggest so because the role and the drop of a marriage counselor is to help you communicate and getting along with each other. Perhaps you can get your marriage back by marriage counseling ing. Even if you failed, at least you had tried. Do you understand?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the text.

我曾向丈夫建議過這種方法，但他沒有接受。他堅持認為婚姻是我們自己的事，我們沒有別人的幫助。既然他都這麼說了，我也無能為力。如果jhonor有能力說服他進行婚姻諮詢，我想嘗試一下。
I once suggest so to my husband, but he didn’t agree. He always insist that marriage is our own business so we don’t want anyone to bother. Since he didn’t accept, I have nothing to do. But if the judge can pursue him to have a marriage counseling ing, of course I will accept.

對此，被告您有何看法？
The other party, what’s your opinion?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I don't mind if my wife wants a marriage counselor, but if we scold him for doing that, will my wife stop looking for her ex-boyfriend? That guy treated her badly, that guy was only interested in our money.
我不會介意去做婚姻諮商的，如果那就是我妻子希望。但是如果我們可以去做婚姻諮商，我希望他可以不要再去見她前男友。那個人不是真心想對她好，他只是對我們以及他的錢有興趣而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

等等，你的意思是你妻子的婚姻有問題嗎？還有一個男朋友嗎？
Hold on, you mean your wife has other boyfriend?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the original text and inferred that the speaker's wife has another boyfriend.

Yes, that guy was his ex-boyfriend, and he kept seeing his ex-boyfriend even after we got married.
沒錯，那個就是他的前男友，甚至在我們結婚後他們也一直見面。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'ex-boyfriend' as '前男友' which means 'former boyfriend' instead of '前男友' which means 'ex-boyfriend'.

您認為這種情況會導致您的婚姻出現問題嗎？
So do you think it’s an important factor that caused the difficulties in your marriage?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I wouldn't say it was the main reason for our marital problems, but I would think it did affect how we viewed each other. I hope my wife won't meet that guy anymore.
我不會說這件事情造成我們婚姻的不快樂，他有一定的份量，至少他影響我們怎麼相處。我希望我的妻子可以向我保證他不會再見那個人。

告訴人，您對此有何看法？
The expresser, do you have anything to state about the issue?

這就是為什麼我說他對一切都持懷疑態度。他確實對一切都抱有很高的懷疑態度。他提到的男性朋友只是我最好的朋友之一。當一個人心情不好的時候，總是想和一些朋友聊聊，我也是。但我的丈夫總是把我和朋友的聊天當作家庭醜聞。他對我的朋友不友好。他不能，因為我有一個男性朋友然後認為我有婚外情。
This is why I say my husband is highly suspicious of me. The male friend he mentioned is simply a really good friend of me. If one is unhappy, he or she would want you to have a friend to talk about this, I’m no exception. However, my husband consider my talking to other people as I’m talking about the family scandal to others. He’s really unfriendly to my friends. However, he cannot consider me having an extra material affair simply because I’m meeting a male friend.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '持懷疑態度' as 'suspicious of me' instead of 'doubtful attitude'

omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase '然後認為我有婚外情' in 'However, he cannot consider me having an extra material affair simply because I’m meeting a male friend'

我的意見是雙方都可以寫下自己對對方原來的看法。告訴人，你要知道，被告在國外有婚姻，在台灣，所以他可能為了你們的婚姻付出了很大的努力。你剛才說你和你丈夫的年齡差距很大，所以。你剛才提到你心情不好的時候總是和你的朋友聊天，我可以理解。這一部分我覺得你應該聽取意見，和你老公有個概念。
My suggestion is can the both parties give up what you think about your partner for a while.The expresser, can you please understand the other party, your husband is a foreigner in this country, he has no family he is no friend. Therefore, he put all his time in this marriage in this in your relationship. As you mentioned, you are a old wife young wife. Therefore his sense of unsafe is understandable. You said that when you feel sad you need someone to talk about, to talk to, I can understand. However, should’t you get your husband’s understanding and consideration in this issue? Otherwise the misunderstanding will only expand.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'can the both parties give up what you think about your partner for a while.' It should be 'Can both parties give up what you think about your partner for a while.'

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text, which emphasizes the importance of the expresser seeking understanding and having a conversation with her husband.

是的我明白。
I get it.

被告，我知道你很愛你的妻子。但如果你愛一個人，就不要每天都懷疑她。就像她剛才說的，他出去的時候，你總是問他，問她很多問題，懷疑他有別的男朋友了。這種態度無法維持健康的婚姻。你必須明白，信任是婚姻的基礎。你必須明白它的重要性。
The other party, I know you love your wife every month still. However, if you really love someone, you shouldn’t be suspicious of her or him all the time. She said that whenever she goes out, you will ask a lot of questions, and you suspicious of having Alder boyfriend’s outside. How can such a situations such a condition remain your relationship?

我明白了，我會試著做出改變的。

看來雙方都不太願意進行婚姻諮詢，您將此案轉至婚姻諮詢中心看看我們是否能得到進一步的幫助。不得不提的是，因為你們都接受婚姻諮詢，所以你們必須一起去婚姻諮詢，否則這一切都是一句空話。我會給這個案例4個月左右的時間，看看你婚姻諮詢的效果。但我必須給你一個意見：婚姻根本不是一件容易的事。大家都知道，相聚容易，共處難。所以，如果你們已經結婚了，就繼續在一起吧。雙方都明白嗎？
Since both parties agree on finding a marriage counselor, I will transfer this case to the marriage counseling center, perhaps they can help you keep this relationship. Please know that since the both party agree this temporary solution, you have to meet the marriage counselor together or this solution is simply a empty talk. And I will give for about 4 months to this case to see the result of your marriage counseling.  But I have to tell that both parties marriage is never an easy scene. Everyone knows it’s easy to fall in love but it’s difficult to last everyday. So since you’ve get marriage, please try to keep it. Can the both parties understand what I said?

我和老公結婚3年了，但是年齡差距太大了，大約有30歲。以前我們談戀愛的時候，我不知道我們有很多價值觀不匹配，所以結婚後，我發現我一點也不幸福。我平時和老公溝通不好，而且他對一切都高度懷疑。他總是以關心的名義詢問我去了哪裡，遇見了誰。一開始我以為是他的關心，但隨著時間的推移，我覺得他越來越認真了。關於關心我。比如說，如果我告訴他我要去崇光百貨，但我帶著清風廣場的包回來後，他就會生氣，問很多關於我的事情。有時候，我不想解釋，但情況卻變得更糟。這種情況從我們結婚之初就開始了。我真的厭倦了這個。另外，我的丈夫是法國人，我的家人都不會說法語，所以我的家人都無法與他交談。雖然我不和家人住在一起，但每逢節假日或特殊場合，我們都會聚在一起。我病了好幾天，所以我媽媽來我家照顧我。由於語言障礙，我丈夫和我母親發生了很多衝突。我在他們之間做了很長一段時間的中間人，我覺得厭倦了，所以我想提出離婚。
I’ve been married to my husband for 3 years, but the gap in age is too large, that gap is about 30 years. When we have a relationship before, I did not know that we have a lot value that didn’t match with each other, so after I married, I found that I was not happy at all. I usually have a bad communication with my husband, besides, he is high suspicious about everything. He always use in the name of care to ask where I go and who I meet. At the beginning, I thought it was his care, but as time goes, I think he gets more and more serious. about caring me. For example, if I told him that I will going to Sogo department, but after I came back with the bag of breeze plaza, he will be angry and ask many things about me. Sometimes, I don’t want to explain it, but the situation becomes worse. Such situation begins at the beginning of our marriage. I’m really tired about this. Besides, my husband is French, neither of my family can speak French, so none of my family can have a conversation with him. Although I didn’t live with my families, but on the holidays or special occasions, we will gather together. I had sick for days so my mother come to my home took care of me. My husband had lots of conflicts with my mother because of language barrier. I have been the middleman between them for a long time, and I feel was tired of it, So I want to ask for a divorce.

除了溝通和生活之外，您還有什麼理由支持您提出離婚？

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you have any reason that supports your desire for a divorce besides communication and life?'

這兩點是我離婚的主要原因。
These two part are my main reason for the divorce.

As your wife talking, saying that life form, what’s your thought about the life form?

I have to admit I had some fights with my mother-in-law because his mother decided to stay with us, but I didn't want her mother to live with us. I respect my mother-in-law, but I know that Chinese people value their parents very much. As for the other question my wife mentioned just now, I was just showing my concern for him. She is actually physically and mentally unhealthy. Two doctors have diagnosed him with mental illness and depression.
我得要承認我有和我的岳母有一些爭吵，這是因為他母親決定要和我們待再一起，但我不想要她的母親和我們生活在一起。我尊重我岳母，但我知道中國人會很珍重自己的父母。至於剛剛另一個我老婆說到的問題，我只是在表現我對他的關心而已。她身心其實都不健康，有兩個醫生已經為他診斷了精神疾病跟憂鬱症

告訴人，您對此有何看法？
The expresser, what’s your opinios toward this distinct?

這就是為什麼我說他對一切都持懷疑態度。他確實對一切都抱有很高的懷疑態度。他提到的男性朋友只是我最好的朋友之一。當一個人心情不好的時候，總是想和一些朋友聊聊，我也是。但我的丈夫總是把我和朋友的聊天當作家庭醜聞。他對我的朋友不友好。他不能，因為我有一個男性朋友然後認為我有婚外情。
This is why I said about he’s suspicious about everything. He really have high suspicious about everything. The male friend he had mentioned is just one of my best friend. When someone is in the bad mood,  they always want to have a talking with some friends, so do I. But my husband always take my talking with my friend as a family scandal.

我的意見是雙方都可以寫下自己對對方原來的看法。告訴人，你要知道，被告在國外有婚姻，在台灣，所以他可能為了你們的婚姻付出了很大的努力。你剛才說你和你丈夫的年齡差距很大，所以。你剛才提到你心情不好的時候總是和你的朋友聊天，我可以理解。這一部分我覺得你應該聽取意見，和你老公有個概念。
My opinion is can both party put down your original opinion toward eachother. The expresser, you must know that the respondent  have a marriage in other country, in Taiwan, so he may put a lot of effort on your marriage. You just said that your gap in age between you and your husband is large, so. You just mention that you always have a talking with your friend when you are in a bad mood, I can understand it. In this part, I think you should receive the opinions and have a concept with your husband.

被告，我知道你很愛你的妻子。但如果你愛一個人，就不要每天都懷疑她。就像她剛才說的，他出去的時候，你總是問他，問她很多問題，懷疑他有別的男朋友了。這種態度無法維持健康的婚姻。你必須明白，信任是婚姻的基礎。你必須明白它的重要性。
Respondent, I know you really love your wife. But if you love someone, do not be suspicious about her everyday. Just like she just said, when he went out, you always ask him, ask her a lot of problems, and suspicious him about having another boyfriend. This kind of attitude cannot maintain a healthy marriage. You must understand that trust is the basement of marriage. You must understand the important of it.

It seems that both party are not, are willing to have a marriage counseling, you will transfer this case to the marriage counseling center to see if we can have the further help.

我和老公結婚3年了，但是年齡差距太大了，大約有30歲。以前我們談戀愛的時候，我不知道我們有很多價值觀不匹配，所以結婚後，我發現我一點也不幸福。我平時和老公溝通不好，而且他對一切都高度懷疑。他總是以關心的名義詢問我去了哪裡，遇見了誰。一開始我以為是他的關心，但隨著時間的推移，我覺得他越來越認真了。關於關心我。比如說，如果我告訴他我要去崇光百貨，但我帶著清風廣場的包回來後，他就會生氣，問很多關於我的事情。有時候，我不想解釋，但情況卻變得更糟。這種情況從我們結婚之初就開始了。我真的厭倦了這個。另外，我的丈夫是法國人，我的家人都不會說法語，所以我的家人都無法與他交談。雖然我不和家人住在一起，但每逢節假日或特殊場合，我們都會聚在一起。我病了好幾天，所以我媽媽來我家照顧我。由於語言障礙，我丈夫和我母親發生了很多衝突。我在他們之間做了很長一段時間的中間人，我覺得厭倦了，所以我想提出離婚。
I’ve had a marriage with my husband for about three years; however, the gap of age of us is too huge, it’s 30 years old. When we were having a dating and a relationship, pur concept are matched; however, after marriage, I’m not happy. In many time, I have a difficulty talking to my husband. Also, my husband is highly suspicious to everything. He usually care about asking who I will meet and the place I will go in the name of caring about me. Firstly, i think he just care about me, but afterwe date, I think he got more and more serious about it. For example, if I said I want to go to sogo in Shihlin district; however, when I came back and the bag is not from sogo,instead, the bag is from breeze plaza, my husband will ask me everything then he will turn very angry. Sometimes, if I don’t want to explain, the situation will get worse. This situation happen just in the beginning in our marriage, I feel so tired, really tired. Moreover, my husband is a French; however, in my family, no one can speaking France. Currently, I live out of the family; however, on holidays or special occasions, I will live together with my family. Some days before, I’m a little sick, my mother came to my house to take care of me. However, because of the language barrier, my husband have conflicts with my mom. Being the middleman, I was so tired, so i want to file for a divorce.

一般來說，在正常的離婚案件中，在台灣人看來，我們希望勸說夫妻繼續在一起，而不是尋求離婚。雙方都想進行婚姻諮詢嗎？婚姻諮詢師的主要角色和職責是找出你婚姻中的問題。也許我們可以通過婚姻顧問來幫助您的婚姻。如果根本不工作，你已經盡力了，你會考慮嗎？

我曾向丈夫建議過這種方法，但他沒有接受。他堅持認為婚姻是我們自己的事，我們沒有別人的幫助。既然他都這麼說了，我也無能為力。如果jhonor有能力說服他進行婚姻諮詢，我想嘗試一下。

這就是為什麼我說他對一切都持懷疑態度。他確實對一切都抱有很高的懷疑態度。他提到的男性朋友只是我最好的朋友之一。當一個人心情不好的時候，總是想和一些朋友聊聊，我也是。但我的丈夫總是把我和朋友的聊天當作家庭醜聞。他對我的朋友不友好。他不能，因為我有一個男性朋友然後認為我有婚外情。
This is why I mentioned he is highly suspicious of everything. The man he just mentioned is just my best friend, just BBF. When a person is sad, he or she would definitely wnat to vent his or her worry to others, I’m no exception. However, my husband just keep consider my venting to others as a family scandal. He always unfriendly to my friends, but he cannot just because of the sex, and treat me likethis, have a extra marital affair.

我的意見是雙方都可以寫下自己對對方原來的看法。告訴人，你要知道，被告在國外有婚姻，在台灣，所以他可能為了你們的婚姻付出了很大的努力。你剛才說你和你丈夫的年齡差距很大，所以。你剛才提到你心情不好的時候總是和你的朋友聊天，我可以理解。這一部分我覺得你應該聽取意見，和你老公有個概念。
Take my suggestion, first, you have to throw away your ideas about others. The expresser, you have to know that the person like the repondantwho traveled abroad and take marriage that much, it is usual. As you mentioned, you have a huge gap, so his unsecurity is maybe make sense. I understand that you just said that said that you are upset, you want someine to vnet your problem. If you don’t tell your husband to let him understand your behavior, the problem will be bigger and bigger to fully understand.

是的我明白。
Yes, I do.

被告，我知道你很愛你的妻子。但如果你愛一個人，就不要每天都懷疑她。就像她剛才說的，他出去的時候，你總是問他，問她很多問題，懷疑他有別的男朋友了。這種態度無法維持健康的婚姻。你必須明白，信任是婚姻的基礎。你必須明白它的重要性。
Respondent, I cam exactly know your feelings that you love her, but you can;t just be highly suspicious of everything just because your love. Just like what she mentioned, when she want to go out, you just ask many many questions. Do your think this could make your marriage better? Isn’t it right? You have to know that marriage is based on trust between two parties.

I get it, I'll give it a try.
我理解了，我會試試看。

看來雙方都不太願意進行婚姻諮詢，您將此案轉至婚姻諮詢中心看看我們是否能得到進一步的幫助。不得不提的是，因為你們都接受婚姻諮詢，所以你們必須一起去婚姻諮詢，否則這一切都是一句空話。我會給這個案例4個月左右的時間，看看你婚姻諮詢的效果。但我必須給你一個意見：婚姻根本不是一件容易的事。大家都知道，相聚容易，共處難。所以，如果你們已經結婚了，就繼續在一起吧。雙方都明白嗎？
Now that you can accept marriage counseling, so I will allow this case to the marriage counseling center. Maybe the marriage counselor can help you about this. But you have to know that this is a solution to your problem, but you have to go to the marriage couseling together. Otherwise, this will just be useless. I want you to go to marriage for 4 months, and after that, I will evaluate the solution. However, take my advise, marriage is not that easy. Everyone knows that falling in love with others is easy, but how to get along with others is difficult. Now you just married, just go to long, please. Do you really understand this?
