My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位是有關英語教學的。要完成這個學位，裡面有些關於教學的課程也有些關於中英語文能力的訓練。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'TESOL' as '英語教學' which means 'English teaching' instead of '英語教學與第二語言習得' which means 'Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' ('is') after the noun '學位' ('degree') instead of before it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that some of the courses were related to culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you pursue for the English teaching mater degree; however there are still some further culture courses in that degree?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'you' in the sentence, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'pursue' instead of 'pursuing'.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the word 'still' which is not present in the original text.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misunderstood the meaning of 'further culture courses' and translated it as 'some further culture courses'.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，至少有三門課是跟文化和溝通相關的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
You used the tem culture, so what would the teacher give you as assignments in the course?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'give' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'used' before the subject 'You' instead of after.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這門課的功課可能會因學生而異。像我自己的話，我來台灣然後想要找一個英語教學的教師職位，為了要達成這個目標然後顯現這個能力，所以我必須要有足夠的中文能力。因此我很多作業都是關於中英句子的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '像我自己的話，我來台灣然後想要找一個英語教學的教師職位'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '功課可能會因學生而異' is translated as 'The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student.' The correct translation should be 'The assignments for this course may vary depending on the student.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the assignments are for culture and communication courses.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the assignments are about Chinese-English sentence translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the user is trying to seek a teaching position as an English teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the user needs to prove their competence in Chinese.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the user's assignments are to show their command of Chinese.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that your goal is to teach English in Taiwan, so the course would ask you to proof your Chinese competence? Therefore, you had to complete some assignments and these assignments are about English and Chinese translation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
當然阿，而且我還需要磨練我的口說和寫作技巧
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, so you said that this message content was your assignment right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿，我還記得那個句子是甚麼。當我看到一個中文句子的時候我可能會不知道如何用英文來表達。你也知道吧，中文字有些時候對於外國人來說很難辨認阿，所以我需要別人的幫助，所以我就問我同事，我請她幫我翻譯然後請她把答案以簡訊寫給我。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	Neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Incorrect use of pronouns
grammar and structure	preposition errors	Incorrect use of prepositions

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that you ask your colleague this sentence in Chinese and she sent it back in English? Is this the situation? You mean that this message was just all about assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那則簡訊真的就只是作業答案而已啦。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then, how about the contents in Document One from page 14 to 16? Please check these messages. Are they all for your assignments? Just because you want your colleague to answer you in English?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，它們的目的都相同，就只是要幫我完成作業而已。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then how about the adultery between you and 王彩燕 from you wife?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'adultery' is not an accurate translation for '外遇'.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
對於這件事我太太真的是想太多了。我知道她對於我可以照顧家庭的能力不滿意。我想讓您知道的是，從我開始念學位開始，她都很不支持，她甚至一點都不想要幫助我完成學位。如果她多幫我一點忙的話，我也不用問我同事啦，我想她應該要為這樣的誤解負責。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: '對於這件事我太太真的是想太多了' should be '我太太真的是想太多了對於這件事'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error: '我知道她對於我可以照顧家庭的能力不滿意' should be '我知道她對於我照顧家庭的能力不滿意'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error: '從我開始念學位開始' should be '從我開始念學位的時候'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error: '她甚至一點都不想要幫助我完成學位' should be '她甚至一點都不想要幫助我完成學位的事情'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing punctuation: '我想她應該要為這樣的誤解負責' should be '我想她應該要為這樣的誤解負責。'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of details: The translation does not include the mention of asking a colleague for help.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, you two don’t get along quite well?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在婚姻初期我們是相處得滿愉快的。但她一直對我的工作有微詞。我也嘗試要教葡萄牙語來維生，但工作不穩定。所以我們有時候會為了這件事有口角，我們常為了這件事情不合，她都不相信我有努力找工作，我也很難讓她理解我有多沮喪和挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們常為了這件事情不合' is incorrect. It should be '我們常為了這件事情不合而爭吵'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '她一直對我的工作有微詞'. It should be '她一直對我的工作有微詞'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '教葡萄牙語來維生' is translated as 'teaching Portuguese to make a living', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'teaching Portuguese in Taiwan'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'fought from time to time over this issue' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced' in the original text.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s go back to the mater degree you mentioned. When did you start your master degree? When did you end it? Did you receive the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you start your master's degree?'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you end it?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'receive' should agree with the subject 'you'. It should be 'Did you receive the degree?'

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2010的春季開始上課。它是一個兩年的課程，我應該要在2012的12月完成這個學業，但是我並沒如期完成，因為我有一些兼職，還要寫作業，這樣有點困難。就想我先前說的，我太太不太支持我，所以我會覺得我自己在念書的時候好像只有一個人在奮鬥，所以我相當疲憊跟挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我是在2010的春季開始上課' (I started the program in Spring 2010). The correct word order should be '我在2010的春季開始上課'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '我應該要在2012的12月完成這個學業' (I should have finished the program in December 2012). The correct tense should be '我應該在2012年12月完成這個學業'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '因為我有一些兼職，還要寫作業，這樣有點困難' (because I had some part-time jobs and had to do assignments, which made it difficult). The reason for not finishing the program is not mentioned in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the mention of working part-time in the sentence '我太太不太支持我，所以我會覺得我自己在念書的時候好像只有一個人在奮鬥' (My wife is not very supportive, so I feel like I'm the only one struggling when studying). The mention of working part-time is not included in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the mention of feeling tired and frustrated in the sentence '所以我相當疲憊跟挫折' (So I became tired and frustrated). The mention of feeling tired and frustrated is not included in the translation.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that it’s two-year-long program and you didn’t finish it, why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '原來是兩年期的' as 'two-year-long program' instead of 'originally a two-year program'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'didn't finish' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我無法達成每堂課的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When was(did) the last semester you registered end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋季班。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '2012年的秋季班'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If what you said I is true, and the last semester of your registration ended on December 5th 2012; then after that you would not have to contact your colleague for the assignment right? However, you two, you and your colleague, had been contacting with each other for over six months after that.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '課程結束' as 'registration ended' instead of 'course ended'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '你就不會有任何作業了吧?' which means 'you would not have any assignments, right?'

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我可能真的無法完成學業，但並不代表我不想學習阿。雖然我無法完成學業，但我想持續精進中文，所以才會繼續和她聯絡。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我可能真的無法完成學業，但並不代表我不想學習。'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. The verb '聯絡' should agree with the subject '我', so it should be '我才會繼續和她聯絡。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about studying 'on my own'. This detail is important for understanding the context of the sentence.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even that you didn’t complete your degree, you still want to sharpen your Chinese by your own?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
是的，這就是我繼續和我同事尋求協助的原因。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
Your colleague is just like your tutor right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是家教的角色她還是我真心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經有提過，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經有提過，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why would she like to teach you Chinese so late at night, even it’s time for bed? Is it beyond the normal relationships between colleagues?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the sentence.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
我說過啦，她是一個很好的朋友，很支持我。她用她自己私人的時間來教我中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是一個很好的朋友，很支持我。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'using her own time to help me learn Chinese'. It should be translated as '用她自己的時間來幫助我學習中文。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach at that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那裏工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does 王彩燕 also work there till now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那裏工作，但我們沒有再搭檔合作了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們沒有再搭檔合作了' instead of '但我們沒有再合作搭檔了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Is there any person you want to subpoena or is there any evidence you want to investigate more?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena 王彩燕 as a witness from 伯元cram school. I want her to describe their relationships and why she wrote that kind of messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '傳訊被告的同事' (contacting the defendant's colleague) in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the part about '說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的' (explaining the relationship between the witness and the defendant, as well as the background and purpose of the messages).

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'is' instead of 'are' in the question.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that cram school has taken some actions for their relationships. Further, the cram school had tried to make 王彩燕 off. I don’t know if there is any possibility to proof this.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? Now the situation is that your program should end on December 5th 2012, and you should not use completing assignments as an excuse to contact 王彩燕. The text messages between you two almost happened after 9 p.m. It’s really easily to rouse people’s curiosity. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master's degree program ending on December 5th, 2012.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'your program should end' instead of 'your program ended'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '以做作業為藉口' as 'use completing assignments as an excuse' instead of 'use doing assignments as an excuse'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the text messages being between the defendant and 王彩燕.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'almost' before 'happened' instead of after it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the text messages happening mostly after 9 p.m.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '起人疑竇' as 'rouse people's curiosity' instead of 'arouse people's suspicion'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant needing evidence to help his case.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我實在想不到有甚麼其他的證據了，誠如我之前所說的，我和我同事之間的簡訊互動真的很普通，我真的只是想要增進中文能力然後繼續學中文。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'communication between my colleague and me' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '誠如我之前所說的' (as I said before) in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple' as '我和我同事之間的簡訊互動真的很普通' (the interaction between my colleague and me was really ordinary), which does not convey the same meaning.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
Then we set next court at 4:30 p.m. on June 9th 2014 for the witness procedure. Please both of you show up at that time. If it’s necessary, you two have the right to lawyer.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '中華民國103年06月09日' as 'June 9th 2014' instead of 'June 9th, 2014'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '證人詰問程序' (witness procedure) in the translation.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re here for the preparation of adultery case.The plaintiff, Ms. Chen, sued the case.The main reason is that her husband is too intimate with his colleague at the cram school.The plaintiff found some messages from his colleague.besides, her husband always makes up reasons for staying late and even have conferencing with Wang zhia yen at night.The plaintiff thinks that the contents of her husband with his colleague Ms. Wang has over beyond colleagues relationship. As a result, she sued the case. Defendant, you wife sued you adultery. What’s your explanation?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong translation of '告訴人' as 'plaintiff' instead of 'complainant'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	wrong translation of '告訴' as 'sued' instead of 'accused'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of '通姦罪' (adultery crime) in the translation

Not guilty, of course.
我無罪

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
how long have you been married? You have kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married?' instead of 'How long you have been married?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you'. It should be 'have you been married?' instead of 'you have been married?'
grammar and structure	omission of details	The question is missing the second part about having kids. It should be 'Do you have kids?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
we have been married for four years. We don’t have children.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'me and my husband' in the translation.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you two marry in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan and he wanted to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'We met each other in Taiwan.' instead of 'We each other met in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker and their husband met in Taiwan. This is an important detail that should be included in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation also omits the information that the husband came to Taiwan 4 years ago. This is another important detail that should be included in the translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses 'teach' instead of 'learn'. The original text states that the husband came to Taiwan to learn Portuguese, not to teach it.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
in the past few years, he worked at Taiwan as a Portuguese teacher?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'he worked as a Portuguese teacher in Taiwan in the past few years.'

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language to learn, his teaching hours was unstable.sometimes he did not have to work for a month.Later he wanted to teach English, in order to have stable teaching hours.But his mother tongue is not English, so he decides to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'After we got married, he kept teaching Portuguese' is incorrect. It should be 'He kept teaching Portuguese after we got married.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb 'was' in the sentence 'When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher' should be 'is' to maintain consistency with the present tense used in the rest of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the teaching hours were unstable and sometimes there were months without any classes.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds the unnecessary information that Portuguese is not a popular language to learn in Taiwan.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation leaves out the critical context that the husband wants to teach English to have a more stable income.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he seek an advanced degree, you mean he want to get a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advanced degree' instead of 'take further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get the degree of English- teaching.He found a online learning program from California in the USA on the internet.He can learn English on the internet without going to the USA.After he finishes the program, he can get a master degree.His original plan is that after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan as a professor.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '取得的學位是關於英語教學的' as 'the degree of English-teaching' instead of 'the degree related to English teaching'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the protagonist wants to become an English teacher in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the protagonist's plan is to teach English in Taiwan as a professor after obtaining the master's degree.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between he and the person he has affair with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇對象' as 'the person he has affair with' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues at the cram school.The cram school has an arrangement of a foreigner with a Chinese teacher. She’s his partner as a Chinese teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'She is his partner as a Chinese teacher.'

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How come do you find out they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'how come do you find out', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'how do you know'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
First, I noticed that my husband always stayed late at the cram school and worked.I asked him several times, it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so many extra work?He told me that because he has to discuss many details with his partner.At first, I did not suspect him.But later I found that he always gets some calls after he came back.And, when he gets the calls, he talks in the study room. He never talks on the phone in front of me.So I checked his phone and I started to suspect him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so many extra work?' It should be 'it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so much extra work?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'he has to discuss many details with his partner' is translated as 'he has to discuss many details with his partner'. The correct translation should be 'he has to communicate with his partner'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the husband receives calls after coming back home.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the husband talks on the phone in the study room.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the wife checked her husband's phone.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds the unnecessary detail that the wife started to suspect her husband.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is always the same number.I was very curious and I checked his text message.After I checked, I found that she text the message with the woman every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼' as 'In his phone book, there is always the same number', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '常常看到' (often see).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail of the person checking the text messages being '我' (I).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail of the person being curious about the text messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail of the person being surprised after checking the text messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail of the person texting with a woman '幾乎每天都通簡訊' (almost every day).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. It should be 'she texts the message with the woman' instead of 'she text the message with the woman'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
It’s just text messages, I think it’s okay, is there any weird content inside?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If these are just usual messages, that’s okay. But he’s a married man, how can he let the other people to send him those intimate messages? I’ve already provided some messages to the court, they should be on the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '讓對方發一些很親密的字句' as 'let the other people to send him those intimate messages', which changes the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court, which is an important detail in the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Document number 1 page number 13. Defendant, please check the content of the text messages.Are these from your cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the text messages mentioned in the original text.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對 這些都是我手機裡的簡訊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I would like to ask you some questions about these messages.The first message is sent at 9:50 pm. November, thirty-one, 2012.from the number 0958932.The content is: I really miss you, my love, what’s the meaning of this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事傳的，我記得那時我請了兩天假，她有點擔心,所以她寄了那封簡訊給我她是在美國讀書的，所以思想很開放那就是她表答自己的方法，她平常都這樣講話，至於my love那個地方只是要表答我們在乎的人
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean the sender was educated in the USA, so she’s more opened?She’s more open-minded about expressing herself, so there’s nothing with the two words, my love?
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not accurately translate the idiomatic expression '我的愛' as 'my love'.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
那就是只是彼此是好朋友會這樣說而已，沒什麼啊
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
What about the last sentence she mentioned?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the last sentence mentioned by the speaker.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛說的，因為我請假所以她有點擔心，畢竟我們是搭檔, 她當然會擔心
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為我請假所以她有點擔心' instead of '因為我請假所以她有點擔心'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'missed me' as '擔心' is incorrect. '擔心' means 'worried' or 'concerned', but it does not convey the meaning of 'missed' in this context.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that she sent those two messages because you took two days off?Because without your assistance, she missed you, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對呀 就是這樣，沒什麼大不了
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, then the second message which is sent at 11:55 at night, January thirteenth 2013, sent by the same person.The content is, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” Can you tell me what does it mean? Why she sends such a message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這句話來告訴我要怎麼寫我一個中文的作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you such a message is to help you with your homework? IWhat does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛告訴法官的，我之前想修碩士學位在課程中，我需要得到30個學分才能得到那個學位，當然我就會有一些作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '修' (to study) should come before the noun '碩士學位' (master's degree).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about completing assignments and exercises, which is an important detail mentioned in the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain the details about your master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我是在修英語課，在那些課程中有些是關於英語教學，有些則是關於文化與語言能力方面的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you want to get the TESOL and there’s some cultural related program, is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'TESOL' in the translation.
inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterpreted the meaning of the original text, which is about cultural communication courses, not a TESOL program.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
我記得至少有三門課都跟語言文化有關係
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What’s the assignment in the program?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'assignment' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
語言文化的作業每個人不同我的話，因為我在台灣想要學習英文來當英文老師為了要達到這個目的，我必須要證明我對英文中文有足夠的了解所以很多的作業都是中英的翻譯句子
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to understand Chinese as to be the teacher in Taiwan?As a result, you have to finish your assignment including the translation of some Chinese and English?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user's translation has a subject-verb agreement error.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的就是這樣, 而且我還需要增強我的寫作技巧以及口說
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay let’s go back to the sentence we just mentioned, is that your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
有 我還記得這個句子，當我拿到這個句子並不知道它的英文要怎麼講 你也知道有時候中文字對外國人來說真的很難，我需要別人幫忙所以我就請我的同事幫我我請她幫我翻譯那個句子然後再寄簡訊給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of asking the colleague to help with the translation.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that you asked your colleague to send you the answer with the text messages?Is that right?The content of the text message is just the answer of your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那些內容就只是我作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then let’s check the page number 14 to 16, the text messages content in the document, please check the content, are these text messages sent from the other party was because you have to deal with your homework?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking help from the other party in the translation.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation of your wife accused you of having adultery with you colleague?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the accusation of adultery.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事真的是想太多了，我知道她不滿意我在經濟能力可能無法養這個家我希望法官知道的是，在我剛開始要求學位的時候，她都沒有給我任何一點支持她根本不願意幫忙我完成我的學業, 如果她能稍微給我點支持，那我也不用找我的同事幫忙啊，我覺得會有這些誤會,都是因為他一開始不支持
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我覺得會有這些誤會,都是因為他一開始不支持' should be '我覺得這些誤會都是因為他一開始不支持'.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your explanation, it seems that there’s some trouble between you and your wife

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
結婚剛開始我們的確很開心，不過問題在我的工作，我想臺灣教葡萄牙語, 可是沒有辦法得到穩定的授課時數結果工作變成我們兩個吵架的原因，我們總是因為這件事情吵架，她不相信我已經在這方面盡力了，沒有辦法讓她了解我其實真的非常挫敗
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我想臺灣教葡萄牙語' should be '我想在臺灣教葡萄牙語' to indicate teaching Portuguese in Taiwan.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '穩定的授課時數' is translated as 'stable teaching hours' which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'stable teaching hours' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user's frustration and difficult situation faced, which is an important detail in the original text.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s get back to the master degree you just mentioned. When did you master degree begin, does it end? Did you get your degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Missing subject-verb agreement in the sentence.

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the verb 'end' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the verb 'get' in the sentence.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的, 這是一個兩年的課程, 我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的但因為我兼職的關係所以我沒有辦法在時間內修完學分像我剛剛說的，我的老婆並沒有很支持我，我覺得好像只有我自己一個人努力在追求那個學位, 我覺得很累而且很受挫
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的' should be '我是在2010年的春天開始的'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence: '我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的' should be '我原本應該在2012年12月完成我的學業'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '但因為我兼職的關係所以我沒有辦法在時間內修完學分' should be '但因為我兼職的關係，所以我沒有辦法在時間內修完學分'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '像我剛剛說的，我的老婆並沒有很支持我' should be '就像我剛剛說的，我的老婆並沒有很支持我'.

grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我覺得很累而且很受挫' should be '我感到很累而且很受挫'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that the program is for 2 years and you didn’t finish at the end, what’s the reason?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒修完全部的必修
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'course requirement' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
Then when did your last semester you’ve registered end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是在2010的秋天
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'fall 2012' as '2010的秋天', which means 'fall 2010' instead of 'fall 2012'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If that’s true, just as you’ve mentioned, then your last semester should be ended on fifth December in 2012There should be no more assignment, right? But the messages you text with your colleague last for 6 months after your program has ended, what’s the reason?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成我的學業但不代表我不想要增進我的語言能力啊！即使我沒有成功地拿到那個學位，但我還是想要增進我的中文能力所以我還是繼續努力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對, 這就是我還找我同事幫忙的原因
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in their translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, your colleague served as your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的中文家教, 她也是一個真心好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她不收
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she still send you the text messages on midnight, when she has to go to sleep? Is this beyond one’s colleague should do?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個非常支持朋友的人，她用了自己的時間來幫助我學習中文

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific subject of teaching, which is 'English'.

Yes, I am still working there.
對 我還有在那邊工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is your colleague, zhia-yen, Wang, still works there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那邊工作, 但我們已經不是搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經不是搭檔了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any detail or any other information or people you want to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena Ms.Wang who worked in the cram school. I would like her to explain her relation with the defendant and explain the content and the reason that she texted those messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's colleague's name, Ms. Wang, and the fact that she worked in the cram school.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'who worked in the cram school' after the name 'Ms. Wang' instead of before.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '希望能夠傳訊' as 'I would like to subpoena' instead of 'I hope to be able to contact'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '證人身分' as 'explain her relation' instead of 'testify as a witness'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '簡訊的撰寫背景及目的' as 'the content and the reason that she texted those messages' instead of 'the background and purpose of the text messages'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had do something to deal with their relationships. They asked Ms. Wang to leave that cram school, I would like to know if it’s possible to clarify this fact?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?The situation is that your master degree, the program has ended on fifth December, 2012. There’s no excuse to say that you and Ms. Wang text message to deal with your assignment.Especially, you always send messages to each other after 9 o’clock at night, and that is very suspicious. Is there evidence can help you with your case？
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'There’s no excuse to say that you and Ms. Wang text message to deal with your assignment.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Inconsistent use of tenses in the sentence 'The situation is that your master degree, the program has ended on fifth December, 2012.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific evidence that the defendant may have to help their case.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有辦法想到任何其他的證據法院可以幫我調查就像我剛才說的，我們兩個通簡訊的原因就是這麼簡單而已，我只是想要進步我的語言能力然後繼續學中文而已
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re going to proceed the preparatory procedure of adultery case. The plaintiff, yu-hua, Chen, sued the case. The main reason is that… his…her husband is so intimate with his colleague at the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages from his colleague. In addition, her husband always makes up reasons for staying late and even have conferencing with Wang zhia…yen… at night. The plaintiff thinks that the contents of her husband with his colleague Wang zhia yen has over…beyond co-worker relationship. As a result, she sued the case. Defendant, you wife sued you…adultery, what’s your plead?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'The plaintiff, yu-hua, Chen, sued the case.' It should be 'The plaintiff, Yu-hua Chen, sued the case.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'The plaintiff, yu-hua, Chen, sued the case.' It should be 'The plaintiff, Yu-hua Chen, sues the case.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence 'his…her husband is so intimate with his colleague at the cram school.' It should be 'her husband is having an affair with his colleague at the cram school.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'The plaintiff found some intimate messages from his colleague.' It should be 'The plaintiff found some intimate messages from her husband's colleague.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence 'The plaintiff thinks that the contents of her husband with his colleague Wang zhia yen has over…beyond co-worker relationship.' It should be 'The plaintiff thinks that the nature of the relationship between her husband and his colleague Wang zhia yen goes beyond a co-worker relationship.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Defendant, you wife sued you…adultery, what’s your plead?' It should be 'Defendant, your wife sued you for adultery, what’s your plea?'

Not guilty, of course.
我當然沒有罪啊!
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The subject '我' (I) should come before the verb '沒有' (do not have).

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, we mainly want to clarify the details of the defendant and zhia yen Wang. We aim at……to find whether their relationship can constitute adultery. Do both parties understand… know the process?
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of the purpose of clarifying the communication details

我明白
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
我也明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you married with your husband? Do you have any child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should be in the past tense to agree with the subject 'you'. It should be 'How long were you married to your husband?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question does not include the information about having children, which is mentioned in the original text.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for 4 years and we don’t have a child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'have been married' instead of 'have married'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
And did you two marry in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan, and he wanted to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
During the past years, was his job teaching Portuguese…in Taiwan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he’s a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still teach Portuguese. However, since there were no many people … not many people want to learn Portuguese, his teaching hours was unstable. Even for one or two months, there’s a period between jobs. After……. After that, he changed to teach English, in order to have a better job. But his mother tongue is not English, so he decides to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Since there were no many people' should be 'Since there were not many people'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'not many people want to learn Portuguese' should be 'not many people wants to learn Portuguese'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence 'his teaching hours was unstable' should be 'his teaching hours were unstable'.

grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Pronoun error in the sentence 'After that, he changed to teach English' should be 'After that, he changed his teaching to English'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that he wanted a better job when he changed to teach English.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	Leaving out the context of why he decided to seek an advanced degree.
omission or addition	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	Neglecting to translate the term 'advanced degree' in the sentence 'he decides to seek an advanced degree'.
omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	Incorporating the unnecessary phrase 'in order to have a better job' in the sentence 'After that, he changed to teach English, in order to have a better job'.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he seek an advanced degree, did he want to get a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advanced degree' instead of 'further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get the degree of English- teaching. He found a distance learning program from California in the USA on the internet. He can have the online learning without going to the USA … and learn English. After he gets all the credits, he can get a master degree. His original plan is that after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan as a professor.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '取得的學位是關於英語教學的' as 'the degree of English-teaching' instead of 'a degree related to English teaching'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'English-teaching' before 'degree' instead of after it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the distance learning program is from California in the USA.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the protagonist's plan is to teach English in Taiwan as a professor after getting the master's degree.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between he and the person he has affair with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇對象' as 'the person he has affair with' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues at the cram school. The cram school has arranged.. arranged a foreigner and a Chinese teacher together, and she’s the one who he partnered with.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How come do you think they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
First, I noticed that my husband always stayed late at the cram school and worked. I asked him several times, it’s only a/ it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so many extra work? He told me that because he has to partner with the Chinese teacher… they have to discuss many details. At first, I did not suspect him. But later on I found that he always gets some calls after he came back. And, when he gets the calls... picks up the phone, he always talks in the study room. He never talks on the phone in front of me. As a result, …I suspect,
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'I checked his phone'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form 'I suspect' instead of 'I started to suspect'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '只不過是個美語補習班' as 'it’s only a/ it’s just a cram school'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方' as 'because he has to partner with the Chinese teacher… they have to discuss many details'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect translation of '這讓我開始有所懷疑' as 'As a result, …I suspect'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is always a… the same number, I’m very curious and then I checked his text message. After I checked, I found that she text the message with the woman every day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'text' should be 'texted'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'text' should agree with the subject 'she', so it should be 'texts' instead of 'text'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the frequency of the text messages

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
It’s just text messages, I think it’s okay, is there any unproper content inside?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'is there any unproper content inside?' does not accurately capture the meaning of '內容很不宜嗎？' which means 'Is the content inappropriate?'

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If these are just usual messages, that’s okay. But he has… he’s a married man, how can he let the other party to text him with so many… text messages. I’ve already presented some text messages to the court, I think it is in the file… it should be on the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Document number… page number 13. Defendant, please check the content of the text messages. Are these from your cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the text messages.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是 這些都是我手機裡的簡訊
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
So I will ask you some questions about these messages. The first message is … was sent from…at 9:50 pm. November, 31th, 2012, from phone number 0958932…. The content is, I really miss you, my love, what’s the meaning of this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事傳的, 我記得那天我請了兩天假, 她有點擔心, 所以她才寄了那封簡訊給我, 我同事是在美國讀書的, 所以她的思想很開放, 那就是她表答自己的方法, 她都是這樣說話, 至於my love那個地方只是要表答我們在乎的人
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean by … do you mean that…the sender was educated in the USA, so she’s more westernized? And she’s more open-minded about her feeling? So there’s nothing, or any meaningful/ meaning of the two words, my love?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
那就是只是彼此是好朋友會這樣說而已, 並沒有什麼
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not capture the idiomatic expression 'friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
What about… how about the last sentence she mentioned?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the last sentence mentioned in the original text.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛說的, 因為我請假, 她有點擔心, 我們就只是同事啊, 畢竟我們是搭檔, 她當然會擔心
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the person was worried about the speaker, but the user's translation implies that the speaker was worried about the person.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker was away for two days, which is mentioned in the original text.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that she sent those two messages because you took 2 days-off? Because there’s no your assistance, she missed you, is that so?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對呀 就只是這樣的內容, 就沒有什麼大不了的
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the message being 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, then the second message which is sent at 11:55 at night, January 13th, 2013, and was sent from the same person. The content is, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” Can you tell me what does it mean? Why she sends such a message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這句話來告訴我要怎麼寫我一個中文的專案
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you such a message, is that she wants to help you with your homework? Is that right? What does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛告訴法官的, 我之前在…想得到碩士學位, 在那個課程中, 我需要得到30個學分才能得到那個學位, 當然我就會有一些作業要寫
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '想得到' should come after the subject '我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about completing assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain… the details…about your master degree?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details about the master's degree.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我是在修英語教學, 在那些課程中有些是關於英語教學, 有些則是關於文化與語言能力方面的
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' instead of '計畫'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'TESOL' is translated as '英語教學' instead of '英語教學計畫'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'some of the courses' is omitted in the translation.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The phrase '在那些課程中' (in those courses) is added unnecessarily in the translation.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you want to get the TESOL … you study for the TESOL program, and there’s some cultural related program, is that so?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
我記得至少有三門課都跟語言文化有關係
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
Then what’s the assignment/ what are the assignments provided from these program?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
語言文化的作業… 因人而異, 像我的呢, 就是, 我在台灣想要學習英文並且當英文老師, 為了要達到這個目的, 我必須要證明我對英文中文有很大…足夠的了解. 所以我很多的作業都是中英的翻譯句子
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to understand Chinese as to be the teacher in Taiwan? As a result, you have to finish your assignment and the homework includes the translation of  some Chinese and English?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的就是這樣, 而且我還需要增強我的寫作技巧以及口說技巧
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s… go back to the sentence we just mentioned, is that your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對啊 我還記得這個句子, 當我拿到這個句子並不知道它的英文要怎麼講, 你也知道有時候中文字對外國人來說真的很難, 我需要別人幫忙, 所以我就請我的同事幫我, 我請她幫我翻譯那個句子然後再寄簡訊給我
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was mentioned in the original text.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that you asked your colleague to send you the answer with the text messages? Is that the case? The content of the text message is just the answer of your assignment
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那些內容就只是我作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then let’s check the page number 14 to 16, the text messages content in the document, please check the content, are these text messages sent from the other party was because you have to deal with your homework?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking help from the other party in the translation.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對, 所有的這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation of your wife accused you of having adultery with you colleague?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the accusation of adultery.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事真的是想太多了, 我知道她不滿意我在經濟方面支持這個家庭的情況, 我希望法官知道的是, 在我剛開始要求學位的時候, 她都沒有給我任何一點支持, 她根本不願意幫忙我完成我的學業, 如果她能稍稍支持我一點, 那我也不用找我的同事幫忙啊, 我覺得會有這些誤會, 她才應該是要被責貴的人吧!
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of 'blamed' instead of 'responsible'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我覺得會有這些誤會'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'ability of supporting the family'

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your explanation, it seems that there’s some trouble between you and your wife.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在一開始, 結婚前我們的確有一段很美好的時光, 但…問題在我的工作, 我想臺灣教葡萄牙語, 卻沒有辦法得到比較多的授課時數, 結果工作變成我們兩個吵架的原因, 我們總是因為這件事情吵架, 她不相信我已經在這方面盡力了, 我沒有辦法讓她了解我其實真的非常沮喪, 而且遇到很多困難

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s get back to the master degree you’ve just mentioned. When did you master degree begin, does it end? Did you get your degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the verb 'end' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the verb 'get' in the sentence.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的, 這是一個兩年的課程, 我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的, 但因為我兼職的關係, 所以我沒有辦法在時間內修習所有我要的學分, 像我剛剛說的, 我的老婆並沒有很支持我, 我覺得好像只有我自己一個人孤獨的在追求那個學位, 我覺得很累而且很受挫
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence: '我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '我覺得好像只有我自己一個人孤獨的在追求那個學位'
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Inappropriate cultural transformation in the sentence: '我覺得好像只有我自己一個人孤獨的在追求那個學位'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean that the program is for 2 years and you didn’t finish at the end, what’s the reason?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法修完全部的必修
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'course requirement' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
Then when did your last semester you’ve registered end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是在2010的秋天
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'fall 2012' as '2010的秋天', which means 'fall 2010' instead of 'fall 2012'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If that’s the case, just as you’ve mentioned, then your last… the last semester should be ended on 5th December in 2012, there should be no more assignment, right? But the messages you text with your colleague last for 6 months after your program has ended, what’s the reason?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我的確沒有完成我的學業, 但這也不代表我不想要增進我的語言能力啊! 即使我沒有成功地拿到那個學位, 但我還是想要增進我的中文能力, 所以我還是繼續研讀
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '即使我沒有成功地拿到那個學位，但我還是想要增進我的中文能力，所以我還是繼續研讀。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability and be fluently speaking Chinese, is that so?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對, 這就是我還找我同事幫忙的原因
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in their translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, your colleague can be said as… served as your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的中文家教, 她也是一個真的好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有, 我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她拒絕了'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why did she still send you the text messages on midnight, when she has to go to sleep? Is this beyond one’s colleague should do?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個非常支持朋友的人, 她用了自己的時間來幫助我學習中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我才說她是一個非常支持我的朋友'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific subject of teaching, which is 'English'.

Yes, I am still working there.
對, 我還有在那邊工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is your colleague, zhia-yen, Wang, still works there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那邊工作, 但我們已經不是搭檔了!
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經不是搭檔了!'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any detail or any other information or people you want to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena the…to subpoena zhia-yen, Wang who worked in po-yun cram school… as a witness. I would like her to explain her relation with the defendant and explain the content and the reason that she texted those messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I would like to subpoena zhia-yen, Wang who worked in po-yun cram school… as a witness.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail of specifying who they want to subpoena. The correct translation should include the name of the person they want to subpoena.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail of specifying the purpose of the witness's testimony. The correct translation should include the reason for wanting the witness to testify.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had do something to deal with … their relationships. One of that thing is that they … asked zhia-yen, Wang to leave that cram school, I would like to know if it’s possible to clarify this fact?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the cram school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you? The situation is that your master degree, the program has ended on 5th December, 2012. There’s no excuse to say that you and zhia-yen, Wang text message to deal with your assignment. Especially, you always, you texted messages to each other after 9 o’clock at night, and that is very suspicious. Is there evidence can help you with your case？

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the question 'Is there evidence can help you with your case?'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我沒有辦法想到任何其他的證據法院可以幫我調查的, 就像是我說的, 我們兩個通簡訊的原因就是這麼簡單而已.我只是想要進步我的語言能力然後繼續學中文而已
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有辦法想到法院可以幫我調查任何其他的證據'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf' as '法院可以幫我調查的證據' is incorrect. It should be translated as '法院可以幫我調查的證據'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'As I said' which is important for conveying the speaker's previous statement.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'the reason for the communication between my colleague and me' which is important for providing context.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the phrase 'I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese' which is important for explaining the speaker's intention.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So, the court will set at 4:30 p.m., 9th June, 2014, to cross question the witness, the defendant and the plaintiff should be there as well, if it’s necessary, both parties can have your lawyer with you.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '證人詰問程序' as 'cross question the witness' instead of 'witness examination procedure'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time and date information in the wrong order. It should be '4:30 p.m., 9th June, 2014' instead of '9th June, 2014, 4:30 p.m.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the need for both parties to have their lawyers present if necessary.

我明白。
Yes, I understand.

今天庭期到此結束。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case.The plaintiff, Yu Hua Chen filed this case.The reason why she filed the case is because her husband … had too imitate relationship with his colleague.The plaintiff found some very intimate massage in her husband’s cell phone.Plaintiff husband usually make up reasons for going home late … and have teleconference with his colleague彩燕王The … information that plaintiff had collected proved that her husband and his colleague has beyond co-workers’ relationship. As a result, the plaintiff filed the case.Defendant, your wife stated that you have committed adultery. In this case, what’s your plea?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	imitate instead of intimate relationship
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	teleconference instead of video call
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of the defendant's name

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯，當然
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當然，無罪答辯。'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the court is mainly to … know the details in those intimate massages.The purpose of today’s court is to find out whether the defendant does have committed adultery with defendant’s colleagueDo both parties understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '通訊細節' as 'intimate massages', which does not convey the correct meaning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect and the word order is unnatural.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the court procedure, which is to determine if the defendant's actions constitute adultery.

我明白
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
我也明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long…have you married your husband? And do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'how long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'have you married'.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The question does not include the word 'been', which is necessary to indicate the duration of the marriage.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years. And we don’t have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or in the foreign country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.'

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past years, his job is teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense to match the time frame mentioned in the original text.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
At first we met, he worked as a teacher who was teaching Portuguese.After he got married, he is still teaching PortugueseHowever, the Portuguese is … always not a popular language in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hours are always not very long.Sometimes … the period between jobs might be one month or two months.Later on, he hopes to have stable income. Therefore, he started to want to teach English.But English is not his mother tongue; he decided to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'At first we met, he worked as a teacher who was teaching Portuguese.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'After he got married, he is still teaching Portuguese.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the period between jobs might be one month or two months' does not accurately convey the meaning of '一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the husband wants to teach English to have a more stable income.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user's translation does not provide the context that the husband's mother tongue is not English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Did you mean that he wanted to study a diploma in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'diploma' instead of 'advanced degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
NoBecause he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he needed to have a degree relating to English teaching.He found a program provided from the California online.  He didn’t have to go to America to learn the course. Instead, he can learn the course through on-line learning.If he finished all the courses required, he can have the degree.His plan is once he has the degree, he can apply for the jobs to teach English through this degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'NoBecause he wanted to teach English in Taiwan'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'it' in the sentence 'He found a program provided from the California online.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'the' in the sentence 'He didn’t have to go to America to learn the course.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'the' in the sentence 'Instead, he can learn the course through on-line learning.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'the' in the sentence 'If he finished all the courses required, he can have the degree.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'a' in the sentence 'His plan is once he has the degree, he can apply for the jobs to teach English through this degree.'

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is the relationship between him and his colleague?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school.The cram school will have a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher in the same class. And the woman is the Chinese teacher in his class.
minor categories of semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'tutoring center'.
minor categories of omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user omitted the information about the arrangement of the Chinese and foreign teachers in the same class.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know he had an affair with her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I’m only aware of that he often stayed late in the cram school.I have asked him for many times that why you have to stay late in the cram school.He told me that because he has to work with the Chinese teacher, they have many things to discuss.At first, I didn’t doubt him.However, I found that he would receive some phone calls after he came home.And when he got the phone call, he will talk to the phone in his study instead of in front of me.This behavior made me doubt him. That is the reason why I started to check his cell phone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband is a teacher in a cram school.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'have' instead of 'has' to agree with the singular subject 'he'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband receives phone calls after coming home.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband talks on the phone in the study instead of in front of the user.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
In the cell phone, did you find anything special?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, there is a phone number called him often.I became curious so I checked his texts.After I checked, I found that he almost texted with another woman every day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'phone book' instead of 'communication records'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the phone number appeared frequently in the communication records.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'called' before the subject 'him' instead of after.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user became curious and checked the texts.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '查' as 'checked' instead of 'looked up'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user found out that the person was texting with another woman every day.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Texting messages is fine, right? Is the content inappropriate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '還好吧' as 'right' instead of 'okay'.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If that is a normal text, that is OK.However, he is married, how could he text with another woman in such an intimate tone?I have provided some messages to the court. I believe you can see them in the file.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the tone of the original text

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see the page 13 of investigatory file.Here are some messages. Defendant, please take a look.Are they the messages on your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是，這些是我手機上的簡訊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
According these messages, I want to ask you some questions.The first message was texted at nine fifty pm on thirty first, November, 2012 from 0958-932*** The content is 我真的很想你，我的愛 What does it mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'I really miss you, my love' as '我真的很想你，我的愛' is accurate and conveys the same meaning.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我一個同事發的我記得那時候我休了兩天的假 她有點擔心我這也就是為什麼他會傳這封簡訊給我我的同事是在美國受教育，所以她的思想比較開放這是她說話的方式至於她稱呼我為我的愛，那只是一種我們之間的稱呼而已
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that because the person who text you is educated in the United States, she is westernized.And the way she expressed herself is more openSo “my love” doesn’t mean anything special, right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of 'my love' and assumes it doesn't have any special meaning.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然，這只是一種表達關心的方式而已，只代表我們很關心彼此
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous statement?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就如同我之前說的，她非常擔心我，我們是工作上的同事 當我不在工作崗位上兩天，她當然會想我啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean the person texts you because you have two days off.Because she didn’t have your help in the class, she missed you?That’s all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by suggesting that the person texts the speaker because they have two days off, rather than the original meaning of the person texting because the speaker didn't provide assistance in class.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對，當時的背景就是這樣，這封簡訊沒什麼
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the message was a text message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message sent at eleven fifty fife p.m. on thirteenth, January, 2013 from the same phone number mentioned above.The content of the message is 我希望你可以在我身邊，什麼時候我們才可以在一起呢?What does this message mean? What did she send you this kind if message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
 她寫給我這封簡訊的原因是教我在作業裡怎麼用中文講這句話
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she texted you this message to help you with your assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我之前講的，我正在進修碩士學程在這個學程，我被要求要修滿三十學分，才可以取得這個學位很自然地，我就有一些作業和練習要做啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '講' (speak) should come after the subject '我' (I).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'my wife informing the court' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of 'assignments and exercises' in the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what exactly you studied for your Master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位名稱是英語教學在這個學程裡面，主要的課程有關於英語教學，其他則關於文化還有語言能力方面的課程
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '學位名稱' which means 'degree name' instead of '學程' which means 'program'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'TESOL' is translated as '英語教學' which means 'English teaching' instead of 'TESOL' which is an acronym for 'Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '在這個學程裡面，主要的課程有關於英語教學，其他則關於文化還有語言能力方面的課程'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the word 'courses' in the sentence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you are seeking a degree about English teaching, but there are some courses about culture and language competence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'competence' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user did not accurately convey the meaning of 'culture and language competence' in their translation, which is a cultural reference in the original text.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是，我記得至少有三個課程和文化與溝通有關
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
In this kind of courses, what kind of assignments would you have?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'have' in the question.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
語言與文化課程的作業可能會因同學而異就舉我為例子我是一個希望在台灣能取得教師資格的人為了要達成這個目的，我必須要證明我在使用中文上很有能力因此，大部分我的作業是有關中英的翻譯
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Because you planned to teach English in Taiwan, the course required you to prove that you have the competence in dominating Chinese.So you have to complete the assignments given by the course and they are about translating sentences
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific assignments given by the course.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the phrase 'competence in dominating Chinese' instead of 'competence in speaking Chinese', resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，而且我還被要求加強我的口說以及寫作能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So back to the message. You said that it is your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我還記得這個句子當我拿這個中文句子的時候，我不知道怎麼把它翻成英文你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說總是比較難了解我需要一些幫助，所以我向我的同事請求幫助我請她幫我翻這個句子，然後將答案用簡訊傳給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of asking the colleague to translate the sentence.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the idiomatic expression 'sent me the answer' to the target language.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean you asked how to translate the sentence to your colleague and she sent the answer to you through texts, right?That is to say, the text is only an answer for an assignment.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那封簡訊只是我一份作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the message being a text message.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
 Now, please look at the page 14 to 16 of the investigatory file.Please look at them. They are the content of the messages. Are these messages all sent for doing the homework?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，這些簡訊的功用都是為了幫助我完成作業
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'messages' is translated as '簡訊' which means 'text messages' instead of 'assignments'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the purpose of the messages was to complete assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then the wife suspected that you have an affair with your colleague 彩燕王. What is your opinion?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '王彩燕' as '彩燕王', reversing the order of the name.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對這件事情真的是想太多了我知道她對我的養家能力非常不滿我希望庭上可以知道，在我在進修的時候，她從來沒有提供任何幫助給我她很不願意幫助我完成我的進修學業如果她有願意幫忙的話，我就沒有必要我問同事了我認為她要為這些誤解負責
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'blamed' as '負責' instead of '指責'

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your responses, it seems that there are some problems between you and your wife.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
 我們剛結婚的時候，我們的確過得很開心但我的就業卻是個問題我嘗試在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是卻沒有辦法有很穩定的工作時數所以我的工作就變成我們兩個之間很大的問題我們常常為這件事情吵架她並不相信我已經盡力了 她完全沒辦法理解我遇到的困難和挫折
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們的確過得很開心但我的就業卻是個問題' is incorrect. It should be '我們的確過得很開心，但我的就業卻是個問題。'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我嘗試在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是卻沒有辦法有很穩定的工作時數'. The verb '有' should agree with the subject '我', so it should be '我嘗試在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是卻沒有辦法有很穩定的工作時數。'
grammar and structure	tense errors	There is a tense error in the sentence '我們常常為這件事情吵架'. The verb '吵架' should be in the past tense to match the context, so it should be '我們常常為這件事情吵架了。'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the phrase 'from time to time' in the sentence 'We fought from time to time over this issue.'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The translation adds the phrase '我們的確過得很開心' which is not present in the original text.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation does not convey the frustration and difficult situation faced by the speaker, which is an important cultural aspect of the original text.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s go back to the Master degree course you just mentioned.When did you begin the course of the Master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春季的時候開始上課的她是一個兩年的課程我應該要在2012年12月的時候完成這課程但是我並沒有完成這個學業，因為我有兼職工作，造成我沒有時間完成我的作業如同我之前所說的，我老婆並不很支持我我覺我是一個人孤軍奮戰地追求這個學業我感到很累而且很挫折
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我覺我是一個人孤軍奮戰地追求這個學業' should be '我覺得我是一個人孤軍奮戰地追求這個學業'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence: '我在2010年春季的時候開始上課的她是一個兩年的課程' should be '我在2010年春季開始的時候開始了一個兩年的課程'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the program was not finished.

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the program was supposed to be finished in December 2012.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the information that the speaker's wife was not supportive.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You said the degree is a two-year program and you failed to finish it.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'failed' should agree with the subject 'you' in the past tense.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我當時沒有辦法完成要求的課程
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
Then, when did the last semester you registered end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個學期結束在2012年的秋季
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我最後一個學期在2012年的秋季結束。'

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said, since your course ended on fifth, December, 2012, after that, you shouldn’t have any assignment, should you? However, the messages you texted with your co-worker continued six months after you finished the course.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the year 2012 in the translation.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我雖然沒有完成那個學業，但這並不代表我不想增進我自己的語言能力啊雖然我沒有完成這個學業，我還是想要增進我的語言能力，所以我就開始自修
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'Chinese' in their translation, which is an important detail.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Even that you didn't finished the degree, you still wanted to improve your Chinese, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，就是為什麼我會尋求我同事的幫忙
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the character of your co-worker is more like a tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'home tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她並不只是一個家教，她是我真正的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her money?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you pay her money?' instead of 'Did you pay money her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經想付她錢，但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經想付她錢，但她拒絕了'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn't pay her, why did she text you back in such a midnight? Does it already beyond co-woker's relationship?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural norms and expectations

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這也就是為什麼我說她是一個很支持我的朋友嘛她願意犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學習中文
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '支持' (support) does not accurately convey the meaning of 'using her own time to help me learn Chinese'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '她願意犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學習中文，這也就是為什麼我說她是一個很支持我的朋友嘛。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是，我仍然在那裡任職
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does the co-worker, 彩燕王, still work there, too?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject and verb do not agree in number.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她還那裡任職，但是我們並沒有一起搭檔教學了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是我們並沒有一起搭檔教學了，她還在那裡任職。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any further witness to subpoena or investigation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is there any further witness or evidence to subpoena or investigate, prosecutor?'

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want subpoena the co-worker, 彩燕王, form the伯元cram school as a witness. I want her to explain the relationship between the defendant and her. I also want her to explain the context of these messages and the purpose.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'to subpoena' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'subpoena' instead of 'subpoenaing' in the translation.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'form' instead of 'from' in the translation, resulting in a mismatched meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the messages in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the messages in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintill, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school did take some actions about their relationship.They even did try to persuade 彩燕王 to resign. I don't know if there is a posibility to confirm this thing.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女王' as '彩燕王', which changes the meaning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'did' before the subject 'the cram school', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'more' before 'actions', which changes the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'even' before 'did try', which changes the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'if' before 'there is a possibility', which changes the meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'to' before 'confirm', which changes the meaning.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendent, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?Now the situation is that your course already ended on fifth, December, 2012.There is no reson that you texted each other for helping you with your assignments.Especially, the messages you texted each other are after nine p.m. It is very doubtfull.Do you have any evidence that may help for your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'There is no reson that you texted each other for helping you with your assignments' is incorrect. It should be 'There is no reason for you to have texted each other to help with your assignments.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the sentence 'Now the situation is that your course already ended on fifth, December, 2012' is incorrect. It should be 'Now the situation is that your course ended on December 5th, 2012.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'to have texted each other to help with your assignments' does not accurately convey the meaning of '以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動' which means 'to use doing assignments as an excuse for your text message interaction with Wang Caiyan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant's master's degree and the date it ended, which is important information in the original text.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不出任何可以幫助我的證據就如同我之前說的，我和我同事之間的溝通很簡單 我只是想要增進我的語言能力並加強中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只是想要增進我的語言能力並加強中文，我想不出任何可以幫助我的證據。'

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So we set the next cout date at four thirty p.m. on ninth, June, 2014 to ask questions to the witness.Plaintiff and defendant, please show your attendence at that day.If necessary, you can have your own lawyers. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我明白。
Yes, I do.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we’re here for the adultery case, preparatory procedure. the plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case.it is mainly because she thinks that her husband, John Anderson, has an intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school.the plaintiff also found some intimate messages in the defendant’s cell phone.in addition, the defendant also made up reasons for extra working hours, and held tele-conferencing very often.What the plaintiff has found is beyond co-workers’ relationship.Therefore, she filed the case.the defendant, your wife filed you with adultery case. What’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'the plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case.it is mainly because she thinks that her husband, John Anderson, has an intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school.' The correct word order should be 'The plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case mainly because she thinks that her husband, John Anderson, has an intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'the plaintiff also found some intimate messages in the defendant’s cell phone.in addition, the defendant also made up reasons for extra working hours, and held tele-conferencing very often.' The correct word order should be 'In addition, the plaintiff also found some intimate messages in the defendant’s cell phone. The defendant also made up reasons for extra working hours and held tele-conferencing very often.'

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the main focus is to find out details about your communication. another focus would be seeing if the behavior that you both had done constitute adultery or not.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omits the specific details of asking the defendant and his colleague about their communication.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user incorrectly places the phrase 'another focus would be' in the middle of the sentence instead of at the beginning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user fails to mention that the purpose of asking about their communication is to clarify if there was an extramarital affair.

我明白
Yes, I do.

I understand.
我明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you been married?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve been married for four years, and we don’t have any child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'we don't have any children' instead of 'we don't have any child'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
i met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I met my husband in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the user and their husband met in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the husband came to Taiwan specifically for teaching Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past few years, he works as a Portuguese teacher in Taiwan. Is that right?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'works' should be in the past tense 'worked' to match the time frame mentioned in the original text.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
He was a Portuguese teacher when we met. After our marriage, he kept on being a Portuguese teacher. But since Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so he stopped teaching. Sometimes he didn’t work for one or two months. Later on, because he wanted to have a stable income, he started to teach English. Because his mother tongue is not English, he seeked an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Because his mother tongue is not English, he seeked an advanced degree' is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Because his mother tongue is not English, he sought an advanced degree.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the husband's decision to teach English was motivated by the desire for a stable income.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he’s seeking an advanced degree, so he decided to study in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that studying for an advanced degree means studying in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. he hopes to teach English in Taiwan. What he really wants to obtain is an TESOL degree. He found a distance learning program in California online. So that he wouldn’t have to go to the states in order to get the degree. He only has to get it through distance online learning. After the program, he will obtain the master degree. His plan is through this program of TESOL, he could find a job as an English teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '關於英語教學的' as 'TESOL degree' instead of 'about English teaching'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '遠距教學課程' (distance learning program) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of '函授的方式' (through correspondence) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user skipped the mention of '在完成所有的學分之後' (after completing all the credits) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of '透過這樣子的一個美國學位' (through this kind of American degree) in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作' (find a job as an English teacher in Taiwan) in their translation.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what’s the relationship between him and the person he has affair with?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word '外遇' (affair) in the translation.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They’re colleague in the same cram school. The school arranged a system. They require a Chinese teacher to work with a foreign teacher, and she is his partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'They are colleagues in the same cram school.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'They're colleague in the same cram school.' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'They are colleagues in the same cram school.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about the arrangement of Chinese and foreign teachers working together in the cram school.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know their affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？' as 'How did you know their affair?' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The word 'affair' in English refers to a romantic or sexual relationship outside of marriage, whereas the original text does not specify the nature of the situation.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At the very beginning, I noticed that he usually worked extra hours. I’ve asked him about this several times. It is a cram school. Why did he work that late? He told me that because he has a Chinese partner, he needs to negotiate some issues with her. At the very beginning, I trust him. Later on, I found that he often got some phone calls. He wouldn’t take them until he is away from me. Then I started to doubt everything, so I checked his phone book.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the husband works at a cram school and the reason for his extra hours is because he has a Chinese partner to communicate with.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the fact that the wife checked her husband's phone because she started to doubt him.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there anything weird you found?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'weird' in the translation.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his calling history, I usually saw the same number. Then I was curious about his messages. After that, I found he texted a girl almost every day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'calling' should be 'communication' or 'message'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question was texting with a girl.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Even if they texted each other every day, is that really wrong? Or you found something wrong in their message content?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the meaning of the original text

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they were normal messages, I’ll just get through it. But he’s a married person, how can he receive intimate messages from a girl? Previously I have provided the court with some messages. They should be in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了' as 'If they were normal messages, I’ll just get through it', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢?' as 'how can he receive intimate messages from a girl?', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the court with some messages in the translation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see page 13 on document 1. There are some messages. Defendant, please check. Are they the messages in your cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages on page 13.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的它們是
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I would like to ask some questions about the messages. The first one was sent on 9:50 PM, November, 31 in 2012, and it is from the number 0958-932. It wrote 我真的很想你 I really miss you. What’s your explanation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
是我同事傳來的。我記得那時候我請了兩天假，他有點擔心。也就是為甚麼他傳這封簡訊給我，他在美國接受教育，所以她比較開放。這就是他講話的方式，至於我所說的「愛」，這就是我們關心別人的方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that the message sender was educated in the states, so her ideas were quite westernized. Then she was quite open-minded about expressing her love. So the word “our love” doesn’t mean too much. Is that right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the meaning of '我的愛' (my love) as 'our love'.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然啊，這在好朋友之間很平常，我們都是這麼說的。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the last sentence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the last sentence in their translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，他有點擔心我，我們是工作上的搭檔耶。當我離開工作兩天，他當然會想我啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'he' is used instead of 'she', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So do you mean that because you had two days off and away from work. So she’s worried. Without your assistance at work, so she misses you. That’s all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，那就是當時的情境，整個簡訊並沒有甚麼大不了
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Then the second message that we’re showing is sent at 11:55 PM on 13, January on 2013. It’s also from the same number. The content is “I want to..我想要你在我身邊，我們甚麼時候可以真正在一起？” can you tell me why she wrote like this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他寫這封簡訊給我因為他想要問我這個句子的…
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So she wrote the message to you because you asked her to help you with a project?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太先前所說的，我正在進修碩士。在那個學程之中，我要修三十學分才能取的學位。很自然地，我就要寫作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about completing assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you make it clear that what is your master degree about?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
是英語教學。在這個課程中，大部分的課程都跟英語教學有關，然後其中一部分是跟語言及文化的能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you’re seeking a master degree on English teaching, and there’s some courses about cultures and languages. Is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，至少有三門課跟文化還有語言相關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
And this kind of cultural courses, what’s the assignment like?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
文化及溝通課程的作業每個人都不一樣。以我自己為例，我目前人在台灣，然後正在攻讀英語教學的碩士學位。為了要達成這個目標而且證明我的能力，我必須要證明我有中文的能力。所以很多我的作業是翻成中文的句子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '以我自己為例，我目前在台灣，然後正在攻讀英語教學的碩士學位。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation. This is an important detail that should be included in the translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan. So the exercise in the courses ask you to show… that’s the reason why you need to finish some homework. And the homework is mainly about Chinese and English translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對，我要磨練自己的口說還有寫作技巧。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So let’s go back to the message. This is your homework, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這個句子的時候，我不知道怎麼用英文表達。因為有些中文字對外國來講，很難去辨認。我需要幫助，所以我就請我同事幫我。我請他幫我翻譯這個句子，然後用訊息傳給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'sent me the answer' is not accurately conveyed in the translation.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The translation does not accurately convey the difficulty of recognizing Chinese words for foreigners.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean that because you had an assignment, and you turned to her for help, so she sent the message for you. Is that right? In other words, the message is the answer of the homework, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那只是作業的答案。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then we’re going to see on page 14 to page 16. All the messages. Please verify the content. Are they all the answers of your homework?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，他們都是我的作業，全部都只有一個目的，就是為了完成我的作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
For the point of your wife saying you have an affair with your colleague 彩燕王. What’s your explanation?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '王彩燕' as '彩燕王', which is the incorrect word order.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
她想太多了，我知道他對我支持家庭並不滿意。我想讓庭上了解的是，在我碩士課程的剛開始，他就沒有提供任何協助。她不想要幫我完成學位。如果他願意幫一點點忙的話，我就不用請我同事幫忙。關於這一切的誤解，他要負最大的責任。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我知道他對我支持家庭並不滿意' should be '我知道她對我支持家庭並不滿意'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Incorrect pronoun usage in the sentence: '我想讓庭上了解的是' should be '我想讓庭上了解的是'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in the sentence: '我碩士課程的剛開始' should be '我碩士課程的剛開始時'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in the sentence: '他要負最大的責任' should be '她要負最大的責任'.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, the relationship between both of you doesn’t seem good.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚的時候，我們的確有段開心的日子。但我的就業造成了一些問題。我想要在台灣交葡萄牙文，但是授課時數並不穩定。所以我的工作便造就了一切問題。我們常為這件事吵架。他不相信我已經盡了全力，我也不知道怎麼讓他了解我的挫折還有困難。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們常為這件事吵架' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們常為這件事情吵架'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So let’s go back to the master degree program. When did the program start?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question about when the master degree program ended and whether the user obtained the degree.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年的春天開始的。是兩年的課程。我在2012的十二月應該要結束。因為我那時候有兼職的工作，沒有足夠的時間完成作業，所以沒有準時畢業。如我先前所說的，我太太不願意幫忙。我覺得我是獨自一人追求那個學位。我很累也很挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我在2012的十二月應該要結束'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for not finishing the program, which is 'because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for feeling tired and frustrated, which is 'I became too tired and too frustrated'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for feeling alone in pursuing the degree, which is 'I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for lack of support from their wife, which is 'my wife has never been very supportive'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean it is a two-year degree, and you didn’t finish it in time. Why is that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法完成課堂作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when was the last semester you registered?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
是在2012年的秋天。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If what you have said is true, the last day of your semester should be on December 15th, 2012. So after the program, you won’t have any assignment. Is that right? But the intimate messages continued even six months later after your program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'So after the program, you won’t have any assignment. Is that right?' The correct word order should be: 'So, after the program, won't you have any assignment? Is that right?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific date mentioned in the original text: 'December 15th, 2012'.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我沒有作業了，我也想要精進我的中文。雖然我沒有辦法取得那個學位了，我還是想要持續進修，成為獨立學習中文的人。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of failing the program in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '就算我沒有作業了' (even when I don't have homework) at the beginning of the sentence, which changes the intended meaning.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'program' as '作業' (homework) instead of '課程' (program/course).
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '成為獨立學習中文的人' (become an independent Chinese learner) which is not present in the original text.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even if you don’t have the courses, you still want to improve your Chinese, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為甚麼我請我同事幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So she is like a tutor for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是像一個家教，他也像一個真正的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
我想要付錢，可是他拒絕了
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'I offered to pay her but she declined,' the user's translation says 'I want to pay, but she refused.'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why does she want to send the messages at midnight when most people are asleep. Isn’t it beyond what a co-worker would do?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我說他非常支持我啊。他用他自己的時間幫我學中文
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'she' as '他' (he) instead of '她' (she).
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used '非常支持我' (very support me) instead of '非常支持我學中文' (very supportive of me learning Chinese).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'using her own time' in the translation.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Did you still work in the same cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
對
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'still' in their translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
So your colleague 彩燕王also work there now?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject and verb do not agree in number.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
他還是在那邊上班，可是我們不是夥伴了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '可是我們不是夥伴了' instead of '我們不是夥伴了可是'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there anything that you want the court to investigate? Or any person to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena his colleague 彩燕王 who is working at 伯元 cram school as a witness. I would like to ask her to explain the messages and her relationship between the defendant.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the purpose of subpoenaing 彩燕王 and the background of the messages.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect word order in the sentence.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there anything that you want the court to investigate?

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has taken some action for the affair of them. And I also heard that they persuaded the woman 彩燕王 to resign. Is there the possibility to ask the cram school to explain about that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女王彩燕離職' as 'the woman 彩燕王 to resign'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the relationship between the two individuals

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate? The thing is the program ended on December 15, 2012. You can’t just explain your relationship with 彩燕王 through the purpose of finishing the homework. Especially your messages were usually sent during 9 to 12 PM. That is really doubtful. Do you have any evident that may help you in the case.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The thing is the program ended on December 15, 2012' is incorrect. It should be 'The thing is, the program ended on December 15, 2012.'

semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '證據' as 'evident', which is an incorrect word choice. The correct translation is 'evidence'.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到法庭能替我調查的事情。如我所說的，我和我同事的通訊，理由都很簡單。我只想要精進我的中文。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for preparatory procedure of adultery. The plaintiff files this case. The main reason that she files this case is because her husband has intimate relationship with his colleague. The plaintiff found some message in her husband’s cell phone. And her husband will use some excuse to chat with his colleague on the internet by tele-conferencing way. The message found by plaintiff showed that the relationship between her husband and his colleague is beyond colleague relationship. So, she files this case. Defendant, for what your wife said, what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The plaintiff files this case.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'we are here for preparatory procedure of adultery' does not accurately convey the original meaning of '今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序'.

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Of course, not guilty.'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
For today’s preparatory procedure, we will understand the details of intimate message between defendant and his colleague. The main purpose is to make clear that the defendant and his colleague is adultery. Do both parties know the procedure?

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long you got married with your husband? Do both of you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'got' should be changed to 'have' to match the subject 'you'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We got married for four years, and we don’t have children.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'got' should agree with the subject 'we'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or other country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you and your husband get married in Taiwan or another country?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We got known each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan, and the main purpose is teaching Portugese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'We got known each other in Taiwan.' The correct word order should be 'We got to know each other in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker and their husband met in Taiwan. The correct translation should include this detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the husband came to Taiwan four years ago. The correct translation should include this detail.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user's translation uses 'got known' instead of 'got to know', which is an incorrect word choice.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation uses 'got known' instead of 'got to know', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the information that the husband's main purpose is teaching Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
For these years, did your husband just teach Portugese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we just meet each other, he was teaching Portugese. After we got married, he was still teaching Portugese. However, the Portugese class is not very common in Taiwan, so his teaching hours is not very stable. Sometimes, a period between the class will be 1~2 month. For fixed income, he started want to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he wanted to get an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'When we just meet each other' should be 'When we just met each other'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'he was teaching Portugese' should be 'he taught Portugese'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'After we got married, he was still teaching Portugese' should be 'After we got married, he continued teaching Portugese'.
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	Missing article in the sentence: 'However, the Portugese class is not very common in Taiwan' should be 'However, the Portugese class is not very common in Taiwan'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Sometimes, a period between the class will be 1~2 month' should be 'Sometimes, there will be a period of 1-2 months between classes'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'For fixed income, he started want to teach English' should be 'To have a stable income, he started wanting to teach English'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important detail in the sentence: 'he wanted to get an advanced degree' should be 'he wanted to get an advanced degree in English'.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
The advanced degree that you just mentioned means that he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'advanced degree' instead of 'further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he tried to get a degree of teaching English. He found a learning program on the internet from California. This program makes him can have on-line learning, and he didn’t need to go to Unite States for these classes. After the classes, he can get the degree. For this plan, he tried to get the degree and find a related job.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'This program makes him can have on-line learning'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the specific degree that he is trying to obtain
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the specific job he is trying to find

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship that he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues in the cram school. The cram school set the Chinese teacher and foreign teacher program. And that woman is his partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
In the beginning, I just know that my husband would stay in the school for more hours. I asked him so many times: why he should stay in the school for more hours. It’s just a cram school. He told me that he has a partner, and he has to communicate with his partner for long time. In the beginning, I didn’t think too much. After that, I found he would get some calls in home. And he would avoid get the phone call around me, and he would get the phone call in study room. It made me very suspicious, and I started to check his cell phone.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '美語補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'English language school'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used incorrect subject-verb agreement in the sentence 'I asked him so many times: why he should stay in the school for more hours.' It should be 'I asked him so many times: why he should stay in the school for more hours?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the husband receives calls after coming home.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the critical context that the husband avoids taking phone calls in front of the user and goes to the study room to talk.
omission or addition	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user neglected to translate the term '中師' which refers to a Chinese teacher or instructor.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find any evidence in his cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about evidence in the original text.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I used to see the same number in his cell phone. I am so suspicious, so I started to check his message. After that, I found that he almost sent the message to same woman every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '常常看到' as 'used to see' instead of 'often see'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user checked his messages after being suspicious

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
What’s inappropriate thing in the message?
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation does not convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness in the message.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If that’s a common message, it’s alright. But he got married, how can he have intimate message with others? I just provided some message to the court, and it supposed to be in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的簡訊' as 'common message' instead of 'ordinary text message'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court, which is an important detail in the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see the investigatory file one of page13. There are some messages. Defendant, please see these pages. Is from your cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific mention of the text messages in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'see' before the subject 'Defendant', resulting in incorrect word order.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機裡面的簡訊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, I have some questions about these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50PM on November 31, 2012. And it’s from the cell phone number 0958-932… And the content is “我非常想你，我的愛” what that means?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
恩，那是由我同事傳給我的簡訊。我記得那時候我有兩天的休假，他非常擔心我，這就是為什麼他傳這個簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國接受教育，她非常開放。那就是她說話的方式。關於簡訊裡面的字眼，那只是我們稱呼對方的一種方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So, you mean that because she stayed in the foreign country, her thinking way is westernized. And the way she showed the feeling is open-minded. So, there is no further explanation for “my love,” is that right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of 'my love' and fails to understand its significance in the context.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
並沒有甚麼其他的意思，那只是好朋友之間的一種稱呼，就僅只於這樣而已。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the sentence before that?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就如同我之前所說，她很擔心我，而且我們只是同事當我連續休了兩天假後，她只是很擔心我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'partners at work' as '只是同事' which means 'just colleagues' instead of '合作夥伴' which means 'partners'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverbial phrase '就如同我之前所說' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was away for two days, which is an important detail in the original text.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So, you mean that because you had two days off, she was worried about you and sent that message for you? Because she didn’t have your assistance, she missed you. That’s all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using 'worried' instead of 'missed'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the sentence 'Because she didn’t have your assistance, she missed you.'

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
沒錯，就是這樣。簡訊的內容並不是甚麼大問題。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'no big deal' is translated as '並不是甚麼大問題', which is a literal translation but does not capture the casual and dismissive tone of the original phrase.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was from the same person. It was sent at 11:55 PM, in January 13 2013. 訊息內容是〝我好希望你在我身邊，我們甚麼時候才能有正當的關係呢?〞What that sentence means?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她發這樣的簡訊給我只是想要讓我知道，這樣的句子如何用另外一個語言來表達。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that the purpose of message just want to help you to do the assignment, what’s that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original meaning

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我之前所說的，我有一個遠距教學的課程。在那個課程中我需要修習三十個學分才能完成那個課程。當然在課程中，我必須要完成一些作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我之前所說的，我有一個遠距教學的課程。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'Master's program' as '遠距教學的課程' does not accurately convey the meaning. 'Master's program' refers to a specific type of academic program, while '遠距教學的課程' simply means 'distance learning course'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the completion of 30 credits is required before receiving the degree.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you just explain about your degree?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我修習的課程是英語教學。課程主要的內容是英語教學、文化以及語言能力。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'TESOL' as '英語教學' which means 'English teaching' instead of 'TESOL' which stands for 'Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the subject '我修習的課程' (the courses I took) instead of after it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that 'some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence'.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So, the degree that you got is TESOL, and there are some culture classes in that degree, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
沒錯，我記得大概有三個課程是有關於文化和溝通的部分。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What’s the assignment about these classes?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'assignment' in their translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
在課程中，指派的作業對於每個人來說都不太一樣。舉我的例子來說，我是一個在台灣想要教英文的人。為了這個目的我必須在課程中展現我有能力表達好中文。因此，我的作業中有很多是關於中文翻譯的部分。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '舉我的例子來說，我是一個在台灣想要教英文的人。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments were for culture and communication courses.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used '指派' to translate 'assignments', which is not the correct word choice. The correct word choice should be '作業'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'good command of Chinese' as '有能力表達好中文', which does not accurately convey the meaning of having a good command of Chinese. The correct translation should be '中文能力很好' or '中文掌握得很好'.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to have the competence of … For that purpose, you had to complete the assignment about translation, is that right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'you have to have' instead of 'you had to have'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific language proficiency required for teaching English in Taiwan.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，我必須增進我的說和寫能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, we just go back to that sentence. You mean that the sentence is just for your assignment, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
沒錯我記得那個句子。當我看到那個中文句子後，我並不知道那句子的中文意思是甚麼意思，你知道的阿!有些中文句子對於外國人來說是非常困難的，我需要一些幫助，所以我請我同事幫忙，我請我的同事幫忙翻譯並以簡訊方式寄給我。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural references or symbols

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So, you mean that you just asked her to translate. And she just translated it and sent it to you, is that right? This message is just the answer for the assignment, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊只是作業的答案而已。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now, we are going to show you the investigatory file one page14~16. Please see the content of these pages. So, the main purpose of these messages just for the assignment, so she sent that messages for you, is that right, is that right?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，所有的簡訊內容都只是為了要完成我的作業而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation of adultery between your colleague and you filed by your wife?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我的太太對於這件事情非常感冒，我知道她對於這件事情危害家庭有很大的不悅。我想要告訴庭上的是，她其實對於我的這個並沒有甚麼太大的幫助，他並不希望我得到學位，要是如果她有一點意願幫助我，我也不用去請我的同事幫忙，我覺得她應該因為這件事情遭到譴責。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'thinks too much of' as '感冒' (catch a cold) instead of '太過於重視' (attach too much importance to)
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'supporting the family' as '危害家庭' (harm the family) instead of '經濟支持家庭' (financially support the family)
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of 'ability' in 'my ability of supporting the family'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of '我想要告訴庭上的是' (I want to tell the court) which is not present in the original text
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	inappropriate use of '遭到譴責' (condemned) instead of '應該受到責備' (should be blamed)

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, both of you didn’t get along with each other …
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們剛結婚不久時，我們過得很開心。但問題就出在我的工作，我只是想要在台灣教葡萄牙文。但我的授課時數真的很少，所以我的工作成為我們相處之間的問題，我們為了這件事情一直爭吵，他不相信我已經盡了最大努力，我不知道要怎麼跟她說我的挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我只是想要在台灣教葡萄牙文' is incorrect. It should be '我只是想要在台灣教葡萄牙文'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '但我的授課時數真的很少'. The verb '很少' should agree with the subject '授課時數', so it should be '授課時數很少'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	There is a tense error in the sentence '我不知道要怎麼跟她說我的挫折'. The verb '說' should be in the past tense to match the context, so it should be '我不知道要怎麼跟她說我的挫折了'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
We just go back to the degree that you mentioned. When did you start you your program? Did you get the degree?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific degree they are referring to.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'start you your program' instead of 'start your program'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not provide any information about when the program ended.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention whether they obtained the degree or not.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在102的春季課程開始的，那是一個為期兩年的課程。我必須在103年的12月完成課程。我並沒有完成我的課程，因為我有一個兼職工作，所以我時間不夠去做那些作業。就如同我之前所說，我的老婆並不支持我，我覺得我一直在靠我自己的能力去追求那些課程，我開始感到很疲倦而且挫折。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	春季課程開始的 -> started the program in Spring
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	102的春季 -> Spring 2010
semantic conversion	omission of details	我 -> I
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	那是一個為期兩年的課程 -> It was a two-year program
semantic conversion	omission of details	103年的12月 -> December 2012
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	我並沒有完成我的課程 -> I didn't finish the program
semantic conversion	omission of details	因為我有一個兼職工作 -> because I was working part-time
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	所以我時間不夠去做那些作業 -> and didn't get enough time to do my course assignments
semantic conversion	omission of details	就如同我之前所說 -> Like I said
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	我的老婆並不支持我 -> my wife has never been very supportive
semantic conversion	omission of details	我覺得我一直在靠我自己的能力去追求那些課程 -> I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself
semantic conversion	omission of details	我開始感到很疲倦而且挫折 -> I became too tired and too frustrated

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So, you mean that the program is for two years. And you didn’t finish that program, what’s the reason?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我不能完成課程中的所有作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'requirement' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
What is the last registration semester of your program?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個註冊學期是在103年。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'fall 2012' as '103年', which is incorrect and does not convey the same meaning.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If all you said is true, it supposed that you would not have any assignment after December 5 2012. The message sent between your colleague and you last six months after the semester, what’s the reason?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
恩，我沒有完成那個課程並不代表我想要停止精進我的語言能力。即使我沒有完成那個課程，我還是想要精進我的中文能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '即使我沒有完成那個課程，我還是想要精進我的中文能力。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So, you meant that even if you failed to get that degree, you want to make your Chinese more fluent by yourself, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
沒錯，那就是我為什麼要請我同事幫忙的原因。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
You mean that your colleague is just a role of tutor, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她並不只是一個家教而已，她也是我的好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay for her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經試圖給她錢，但是她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經試圖給她錢，但是她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay to her, why would she send that message for you even if in the mid-night. Is that beyond co-worker relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我之前所說，她只是一個熱心助人的朋友。她運用很多時間來幫助我學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我之前所說，她只是一個熱心助人的朋友。'

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific subject of the cram school.

Yes, I am still working there.
沒錯，我還在那裡教書。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is that colleague still in that cram school?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '服務' as 'cram school' instead of 'work/service'.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
沒錯，她仍然在那裏工作，但我們已經不再搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不再搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經不再搭檔了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Does the prosecutor want to have more any evidence or witness?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena the witness of defendant’s colleague, Tsai Yan Wang. We want her to explain the background and purpose of that message.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the colleague working at Bo Yuan Cram School and the relationship between the witness and the defendant.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'want' instead of 'wants' to match the singular subject 'I'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Does the defendant want the court to find some evidences for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff as the one requesting the court to find evidence.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I just heard that the cram school took some steps for them. And they tried to persuade his colleague to leave the cram school. Can we check this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女王彩燕' as 'his colleague'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'they' as the subject, but it should be 'the cram school'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the actions taken by the cram school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you want the court to find some evidences for you? The situation is that you finished the program on December 5 2012. You should not have the excuses of doing homework for sending the message. Particularly, both of you sent the message for each other after 9:00 PM, it’s very doubted. Do you have any evidence for your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Do you want the court to find some evidences for you?' is incorrect. It should be 'Do you want the court to find any evidence for you?'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the sentence 'The situation is that you finished the program on December 5 2012.' is incorrect. It should be 'The situation is that you finished the program on December 5, 2012.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'evidences' should be 'evidence' in the sentence 'Do you want the court to find some evidences for you?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'You should not have the excuses of doing homework for sending the message.' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'You should not use doing homework as an excuse for your text message interaction.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'it’s very doubted' is an omission of the details in the original text. It should be 'it raises suspicions.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase 'Do you have any evidence for your case?' is an omission of the details in the original text. It should be 'Do you have any evidence that can help your case?'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我無法想到有甚麼證據可以幫助我的案子，就如同我之前所說，我和我同事之間的簡訊只是平凡的簡訊而已。我只是想精進我的中文能力而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court's investigation and the purpose of the communication.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '就如同我之前所說' in the wrong position in the sentence.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So, the next court day will be set at 4:30, in June 9 2014, and it will be the witness inquiry procedure. Please both of you should make it. If it’s necessary, both of you can have lawyers, is that clear?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect date and year

我明白。
Yes.

I understand.
我明白了。

今天庭期到此結束。

告知權利義務
Next, I am going to information your rights and obligations.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'about' before 'your rights and obligations', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
You have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will. (You do not have to make any statement against your will.)
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase 'You do not have to make any statement against your will.'

semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user added the phrase 'falls under the poverty line' which is not present in the original text.

3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。

被告是否了解以上權利？
Do you fully understand your rights?

我了解了

Not guilty, of course.
我當然是無罪的啊!
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'am' should agree with the subject '我' (I), so it should be '我當然是無罪的啊!'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the main purpose of this procedure is to seek out the detail information to find out whether the defendant is having an affaire with Cai Yan Wang and it might constitute the adultery, do you understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '被告與其同事之通訊細節' as 'detail information to find out whether the defendant is having an affaire with Cai Yan Wang'.

我明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, I want to ask the plaintiff, how long have you married, and do you kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the plaintiff's husband.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have already married for four years, and we do not have kid.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should be in the past tense to agree with the subject 'we'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker is referring to her husband.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the fact that they do not have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Do you marry your husband in Taiwan or in other country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you marry your husband in Taiwan or in another country?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan as a Portuguese teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker is also from Taiwan.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
During those years, did he teach Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met, he was a Portuguese teacher, and after we married, he still taught Portuguese. But Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan; therefore his teaching hours are not stable. Sometimes he might did not have any class between one or two months. Because he wanted to make our financial status more stable, therefore he started to taught English. But his mother tongue is not English; therefore, he sought an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'he might did not have any class'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in 'he still taught Portuguese'
grammar and structure	tense errors	inconsistent use of past tense and present tense in 'he still taught Portuguese' and 'he started to taught English'
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	missing article 'a' before 'Portuguese teacher'
grammar and structure	preposition errors	incorrect use of preposition 'to' in 'he started to taught English'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'one or two months of classes' in 'Sometimes he might did not have any class between one or two months'
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	repetition of 'he still taught Portuguese' and 'he started to taught English'
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	lack of context for 'he sought an advanced degree'
omission or addition	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	failure to translate 'advanced degree'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mention before that he sought an advanced degree, do you mean he studies a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he hoped to teach English in Taiwan, therefore, he have to get the degree of the TESOL. On the Internet, he found a distance learning program provided by California school. He did not have to go to the US, and can learn on-line. After he finishes the classes, he can get the degree. His plan is to find an English teacher job in Taiwan by getting an US degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the specific degree (TESOL)

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Can you explain the relationship between your husband and the woman in this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in cram school. In the cram school, they have the system of a foreigner teacher partner with a Chinese teacher, and they are partners.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they are having an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I found that my husband started to stay at the cram school for a long time. I asked him many times “It is just a cram school, why did you have to stay there so long?” He told me that because he had to partner with a Chinese teacher, and they had to cooperate with each other. At first, I did not suspect he is having an affair with her. But after a while, I noticed that, my husband would get some phone calls after he came home. When he received those phone calls, he did not speak the phone directly in front of me, instead going to the study room. That is the reason why I checked the information in his cell phone.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '中師搭檔教學' as 'partner with a Chinese teacher' instead of 'cooperate with a Chinese teacher'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the protagonist checked her husband's phone because of her suspicions.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything strange in his cell phone?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the singular verb 'find' instead of the plural verb 'finds' to agree with the subject 'you'.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
 I saw his phone calls always from one number, so I was curious about the text messages and I checked them. After I checked the messages, I found that he almost chatted with a woman everyday.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通簡訊' as 'chatted with' instead of 'texted with', which changes the meaning.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
I think it is okay to text messages, is anything wrong in the content?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting the appropriateness of the content in the target language

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If those messages’ content are normal, that will be okay. But he is a married man, how could he let a girl to text him some intimate messages? I have provided some content of the messages, I think they might in the investigation file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '已婚的人' as 'married man' instead of 'a married person'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court, which is an important detail.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please check page 13, file one. There are some messages content, please check them. Are these your messages from your cell phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對，這些是我電話中的簡訊。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'message' is translated as '簡訊' which means 'text message' instead of '訊息' which means 'message'.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I have some question about the message content. The first message is from the cell phone 0958-932xxx at 9:50 p.m., on December thirty first, 2012. The content is 我非常想你 可以請你解釋一下嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message. The original message says 'I really miss you, my love,' but the translation says 'I really miss you. Can you explain it to me?'

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我同事發來的。我記得那陣子，我休了兩天的假。她可能有點擔心吧。這就是她發給我這封簡訊的原因。我同事在美國受過教育，他非常開放，這是她的講話方式啊!至於她稱呼我是她的愛人，這只是她的一個稱呼罷了。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that because the people was educated in the USA, and she is westernized, and she is open minded to express her feeling, so the name, my love, does not mean a lot?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
這只是普通朋友間很常見的稱呼，或者是表達你對你很親密朋友的關心罷了
minor categories of cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous line?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我說啦，她很擔心我，我們是夥伴啊!當我請了兩天的假以後，她當然會開始想我阿。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '開始' (start) should come before the subject '她' (she).

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You are saying that because of your two days off, she texted you this kind of message. Without your help in the work, she missed you a lot. Is that all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the person missed the user a lot due to the user's absence from work.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
這封簡訊就沒甚麼大不了的，內容是很普遍的， 這只是很單純的簡訊。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'no big deal' is translated as '沒甚麼大不了的', which does not capture the casual and nonchalant tone of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The next message was from the same cell phone at 11:55 p.m., on January thirteenth, in 2013.內容是我想要你在我身逼，甚麼時候才能在一起呢? Can you explain the content?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The translation of 'by my side' as '在我身逼' is incorrect. It should be '在我身邊' or '在我身旁'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'truly together' as '在一起' is not accurate. It should be '真正在一起' or '真正地在一起'.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她發簡訊給我，只是為了告訴我功課的中文該如何表達的一句話
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Do you mean that she sent this message to you just to help you with your homework can you explain that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
我太太之前有跟庭上報告過，我正在上遠距離教學。為了得到學位，我必須完成30學分，當然啦，我就必需完成一些功課或者是作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我之前有跟太太報告過'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about attending a Master's program and mentioned '遠距離教學' instead, which is not mentioned in the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain that what is your master degree for?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是有關英語教學的。這個學位的課程內容有些是有關英語語言能力的、有些是有關文化跟英語教學。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '碩士學位' is translated as 'program' instead of 'degree'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我的碩士學位是有關英語教學的。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the courses being part of the program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that some courses were related to culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you are saying that in your master degree, the main program is for English competence, but there are some culture classes?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得課程裡有3門課程是有關文化溝通的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
Can you tell me the homework of the culture communication classes?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'homework' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這門課裡，每個學生的作業都是因人而異的。以我自己為例的話，我在台灣想要當一名英文老師，為了達到這個目的，我需要證明我有足夠的語言能力，尤其是對中文的掌握。所以我的功課內容很多是有關中英語間的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '以我自己為例的話' is incorrect. It should be '以我自己為例'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '這門課裡' which is important for the context of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '每個學生的作業都是因人而異的' which provides information about the assignments being different for each student.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '尤其是對中文的掌握' which emphasizes the importance of Chinese language proficiency.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Your plan is to teach in Taiwan. Therefore, you have to prove you have the Chinese competence. So you have to finish some assignments, and that is about translation between Chinese and English, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
我還必須加強我的寫作和口語能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, let’s go back to the next point. You said that is your homework, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
我記得這句話。當我拿到這句話的中文時，我不知道要怎麼把它翻成英文。你知道的，中文對外國人來說是很難辨識的，它們都長得一樣。我需要一些幫助，所以我就請我的同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯這句話，再把這句話寄給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific sentence that was translated by the colleague.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You are saying that you gave your college the Chinese sentence, and she translated it into English and sent it back to you. Is that right? In other words, the content of this message is just a part of your assignment, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
這封簡訊的內容，就只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the message was a text message.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now, please check page 14 to 15 of file one, the content of all messages. Please check those messages. Are they all your assignments, and you ask your co-workers to help you?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
這些簡訊都只有一個目的，就是為了幫助我完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the purpose of the messages.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, as for the accuse from you wife that you are having affair with Cai Yan Wang, what is your explanation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了。我知道她覺得我對家庭的付出不夠。我想要強調，再我求學的這段過程，我太太一開始完成沒有支持我。她不希望幫助我完成我的學業，如果她願意幫助我的話，我根本就不需要請我的同事幫我。我覺得她應該為造成這種誤解負責。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '再我求學的這段過程' is incorrect. It should be '我求學的這段過程中'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '完成' should agree with the subject '她', so it should be '她不願意幫助我完成我的學業'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我根本就不需要請我的同事幫我' is a mismatched meaning. It should be '我根本不需要請我的同事幫忙'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The phrase '我覺得她應該為造成這種誤解負責' omits the detail of blaming her for not being supportive. It should be '我覺得她應該為不給予支持而造成這種誤解負責'.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, I think there might be some misunderstanding between you and your wife.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們剛結婚時真的很甜蜜。但我的工作造成我們之間的問題，我試著在台灣教葡萄牙，但我的授課時數一直很不穩定，所以我的工作問題就造成我們兩個之間的不和，我們為了我的工作常常吵架。她不相信我已經近全力在工作了，我也不知道我要怎麼表達我己經…我的沮喪、我的難過
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我試著在台灣教葡萄牙' (I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan). The correct word order should be '我試著在台灣教葡萄牙'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我試著在台灣教葡萄牙' (I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan). The verb '教' (teach) should agree with the subject '我' (I) and be conjugated as '教了' (taught).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence '我試著在台灣教葡萄牙' (I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan). The word '教' (teach) should be translated as 'teaching' instead of 'tried teaching' to accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我也不知道我要怎麼表達我己經…我的沮喪、我的難過' (I also don't know how to express my frustration and sadness). The correct word order should be '我也不知道我要怎麼表達我的沮喪、我的難過'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'employment' in the sentence '我的工作問題就造成我們兩個之間的不和' (My job problem caused discord between the two of us). The word 'employment' is important for accurately conveying the meaning of the original text.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, let’s back to your master degree. When did you start your master degree? Did you finish? ….When was it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the specific question about whether the person obtained the degree.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年的春天開始課程的。這是一個兩年的課程。我本來應該在2012年的12月拿到學位。可是我並沒有拿到學位，因為我必須在台灣做兼職工作，而我沒有很多時間來做我的作業。像我之前說的，我太太並不支持我。我覺得我在追求學位的時候是一個很孤單的過程，我覺得太疲累、太沮喪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我在2010年的春天開始課程的'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '我本來應該在2012年的12月拿到學位'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '因為我必須在台灣做兼職工作'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated in the sentence '我覺得太疲累、太沮喪'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling alone in the pursuit of the degree in the sentence '我覺得我在追求學位的時候是一個很孤單的過程'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for lack of support from the wife in the sentence '像我之前說的，我太太並不支持我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not having enough time to do course assignments in the sentence '因為我沒有很多時間來做我的作業'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
Did you mean the program is a two-year program but you did not finish the course? Why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the original meaning of the sentence.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法完成課程的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When was your last semester registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋天。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'registration' from the translation.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If you are telling the truth, the last day of your registration was December fifth, 2012. So after the day, basically you do no have any homework, is that right? Can you explain why you kept contacting with your co-worker after the last day of your registration for six months?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of '結束日期' as 'registration' instead of 'end date'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'last semester' in the translation
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'basically you do no have any homework'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'text messages' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'after the last day of your registration' in the translation

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
恩..我沒有拿到學位，但不代表我不想增進我的中文能力。雖然我沒有拿到學位，我也想要練習我的中文，所以我一直自學。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我沒有拿到學位，但不代表我不想增進我的中文能力。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'Even when I failed the program' in their translation.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even though you fail to finish the degree, but you still want to improve your Chinese and make you speak Chinese fluently?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，所以我才請我的同事幫忙。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, the role of your co-worker is as your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，還是我一個貼心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我有試著付她錢但是她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有試著付她錢但是她拒絕了' instead of '沒有，我有試著付她錢但是她拒絕了'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
So, if you did not pay her, why did she need to text you in the midnight when everyone is sleeping? Does that far beyond co-worker’s relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說他是一個很支持我的朋友。她用她自己私人的時間來幫助我學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我才說她是一個很支持我的朋友。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '他' is used instead of '她', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Do you still teach English in that cram school?'

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我還在那家補習班工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
And, does the co-worker, Cai Yan Wang, still work there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那家補習班工作，但我們現在已經不是夥伴的關係了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們現在已經不是夥伴的關係了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any evidence you need to investigate or any witness to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena Cai Yan Wang, who is still working at the Bo Yuan cram school, as a witness. We want her to explain the reason why she texted those messages, and explain the relationship between she and the defendant.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the crucial information that the purpose of subpoenaing Cai Yan Wang is to have her testify about the content and background of the text messages.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'is' instead of 'was' to match the past tense of 'subpoenaed'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated 'subpoena' as 'text' and 'witness' as 'explain'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there any evidence you want the court to investing for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
 I heard that the cram school has do some action because of their relationship. And there even someone was trying to persuade Cai Yan Wang to leave the cram school. Is it possible to verify the truth?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific action taken by the cram school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there any evidence you want to court to investigate for you? The situation is your program was ended on December fifteenth, 2012. There is still no reason for you to keep texting messages with Cai Yan Wang for helping the homework. Especially, most of your messages are after nine o’clock, it is very suspicious. Do you have any evidence to prove your innocence?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the date '101年12月05日' as 'December fifteenth, 2012' instead of 'December 5th, 2012'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user incorrectly placed the phrase 'for helping the homework' after 'texting messages with Cai Yan Wang' instead of before.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's master's degree in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of the defendant's suspicion in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the question asking if the defendant has any evidence to help their case.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我現在想不到有任何證據可以提供給法院來證明我的行為。我說過了，我和我同事間的簡訊互動是非常平常。我只是想要繼續學中文，並且增進我的中文能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the next court will be at four o’clock p.m., on July ninth, 2014. The main purpose of the court is to examine the witness’s statements. Plaintiff and defendant please show up on that day. If necessary both of you can have your lawyers. Do you understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong date and time
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of the witness examination procedure

我明白。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are going to discuss the adultery case. The plaintiff filed this case. The reason is that the plaintiff’s husband had the intimate messages with colleague in the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate massages in her husband’s phone. Moreover, her husband often made up reasons for additional working in the cram school, and sometimes in the in the night………The plaintiff found the content in the messages and the behavior between them is beyond co-worker’s relationship. Defendant, your wife doubts that you have adultery, what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence structure should be 'The plaintiff filed this case because the plaintiff's husband had intimate messages with a colleague in the cram school.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '從往過密' as 'had the intimate messages' is incorrect. The correct translation should be 'had a close relationship with'.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparing procedure, the main course is to ask the defendant and his colleague about the intimate messages. The aim is to find out if they constitute the adultery. Do both party understand the procedure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我明白
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
我明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long is your marriage?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. The subject should come before the verb.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
Our marriage last four years, we don’t have child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'last' should be in the past tense to agree with the subject 'marriage'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker is talking about herself and her husband.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the word 'already', which is present in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order, which affects the clarity and naturalness of the sentence.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry in Taiwan? Or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I acquainted with my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I met my husband in Taiwan.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'acquainted' is not the appropriate word choice here. It should be 'met' or 'got to know'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the husband came to Taiwan specifically to teach Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So I the past years, your husband’s job is teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense to match the context of the sentence.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we know each other at the very first time, he is a teacher who teaching Portuguese. After we married, he still teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hour is not very regular. Sometimes, there….will….are 1or2 months between jobs. to make the income more regularly, he changes to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he seeks an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'When we know each other at the very first time'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Incorrect subject-verb agreement in the sentence 'After we married, he still teach Portuguese'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence 'Sometimes, there….will….are 1or2 months between jobs'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing punctuation in the sentence 'to make the income more regularly, he changes to teach English'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence 'he seeks an advanced degree'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
As you said, he want to seek a advanced degree. Is it mean he want to get the degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of '進修' as 'seeking an advanced degree' instead of 'further education'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he want to teach in Taiwan, he wants to get the English teaching degree. And he found a distance learning program on the internet which is from the California. This program enable him to not to go to the America and still can get the learning program from distance learning. And after he…complete this program, he can get the degree. His plan is after he get the degree from the program, he can teach English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And after he…complete this program' should be 'And after he completes this program'.

grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing punctuation in the sentence: 'And after he…complete this program' should be 'And after he completes this program.'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the translation. The original text mentions that the degree is related to English teaching, but this detail is not included in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	Leaving out critical context in the translation. The original text mentions that the distance learning program is from California, but this detail is not included in the translation.

omission or addition	incorporating superfluous words or phrases	Incorporating unnecessary words in the translation. The phrase 'from the program' is not present in the original text.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what’s the relationship between the person he has the affair with
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'affair' is translated as '外遇' which means 'extramarital affair' instead of '關係' which means 'relationship'.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleague in cram school. The cram school schedule a program which combine the Chinese teacher and foreigner teacher. And the woman is the Chinese teacher who partner with him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'They are colleagues in a cram school.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '補習班' as 'cram school' is incorrect. It should be translated as 'tutoring center' or 'private tutoring school'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the cram school has a program with Chinese and foreign teachers working together.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not mention that the woman is the Chinese teacher in his class.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did know they are in the adultery?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I found my husband usually stay in cram school for additional work. I had ask him many time:”it just a cram school, how could he stay there so long?” he told me that, he has to teach English …………………. At beginning, I didn’t doubt him. However, I found that after he went home, sometimes he will got the phonecall in night. When he got the phone call, he won’t talk in front of me; however, he went into the study room. It made me become doubtable ………..
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'I had ask him many time' should be 'I had asked him many times'.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So what did you find in his telephone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone book, it appears a same number many times. So I am very curious about that, so I check his phone book. After I check her telephone. He sent the messages every day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the gender of the person the subject is communicating with.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the object 'her telephone' before the verb 'check', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'phone book' instead of 'communication records'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '簡訊' as 'telephone' instead of 'text messages'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Even if he sent the messages every day. It’s normal, or if there any……………
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If these are common messages, it’s ok with me. However, he is married, how could that woman sent the intimate messages. I had provide their messages I the court. I think they are in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了' as 'If these are common messages, it’s ok with me.' The correct translation is 'If they were just ordinary text messages, it would be fine.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user incorrectly translated '可是他是一個已婚的人' as 'However, he is married.' The correct translation is 'However, he is a married person.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court in their translation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
I am going to show you a file……….there are some contents of the message. Please check. Are these your messages?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是這是我手機的簡訊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
And now I will ask you some questions about the messages. The first one is in 9:30 pm, on 2012, Nonmember 31, from 0958932***. The content is “I really, my love.” What does it mean?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'miss' as 'really'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect placement of words in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the word 'miss'

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
喔那是從我同是那傳來的阿,我記得那天我休假了兩天,而他很擔心我發生什麼事了,這也就是為什麼他要傳簡訊給我,我同事是接受美國教育的,他是個很開放的人,這就是他講話的方式,他表達自己情感的方式,致於我們通常都稱對方…..
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	mismatched meaning: 'colleague' translated as '同是那'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	mismatched meaning: 'concerned or worried' translated as '擔心我發生什麼事了'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of details: 'message' not translated
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	inappropriate cultural transformation: 'my love' translated as '我們通常都稱對方'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
As you said, the one who sent the message was educated in America, so she is very open mined or westernized. So the way she express herself is more open minded. So the term “My Love” do not mean anything, right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of 'My Love' and assumes it has no special meaning.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然阿,對我們來講,這就是對於好朋友之間的稱呼阿……………..
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
What about the message before that?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的阿,他就是很擔心我阿,我們是課程上的搭檔,當我休假兩天的時候他是真的很想我阿
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'partners at work' as '課程上的搭檔' which means 'partners in class' instead of '工作上的搭檔' which means 'partners at work'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '他' (he) before the verb '是' (is) in the sentence '他就是很擔心我阿' which should be '就是他很擔心我阿'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'When I was away for two days' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'naturally' in the translation.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that the woman sent these messages just because you didn’t go to work in these two days? Because without your help, she was very miss you. Is that all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning of the text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對阿,這就是整個簡訊的重點,所以簡訊內容根本就不是什麼了的是
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
So the second message is from in 11:55 pm, on 2013, January 13. And this is from the same sender. The content …………….  What does this message mean? Why did she sent this to you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他傳這封簡訊是教我怎麼用中文表達自己的情感
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他傳這封簡訊給我，告訴我如何在我的作業中表達一個中文句子。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of the original text is not accurately conveyed in the translation. The original text is about someone sending a message to explain how to express a Chinese sentence, while the translation suggests that the message is about teaching the person how to express their emotions in Chinese.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Do you mean that the sender sent this message just because she wants to help you with your assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太告訴你們的,我參加了一個碩士課程,在那個課程中,我必須完成三十個學分才能的到學位,所以當然我必須完成許多作業跟研究報告
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我太太告訴你們的,我參加了一個碩士課程。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about completing assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what’s your degree?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我所受的課程是英語教學課程,那課程包括一些英語教學還有文化,語言能力相關的一些課
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' which means 'courses' instead of 'program' in the context of TESOL.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'related to' is translated as '相關的' which means 'related' instead of '包括' which means 'including' in this context.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that 'some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence'.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So the degree you are going to get is about TESOL and about the culture communication, right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對阿,救我記憶所及,我記得有三個課程都跟文化溝通有關
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what’s the assignment from culture communication?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'kind' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這個課程作業會根據每個學生的不同有不一樣的作業,以我為例,我是一個想在台灣獲得英語教學碩士的人,在這個課程中我必須證明我自己的語言能力,而且我必須向這個課程證明我的中文能力,所以在這個課程中我所做的作業都跟中英翻譯有官
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of assignments being about Chinese-English sentence translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Do you mean that the English degree you want to get ask you to prove your Chinese competence? So you have to complete the assignment about the culture communication, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對阿當然,同時我也必須精進我的說跟寫
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So let’s go back, so do you mean that these are your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿當我看到這些中文句子的時候我還不知道我要怎麼把它翻成英文,我想你們應該知道這些句子對外國人來講是很難去記得的,我需要別人的幫助,所以我請我的搭檔協助我,我請他幫我翻譯這些句子,然後請他寄給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of asking the colleague to translate the sentence.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The translation does not adapt the idiomatic expression 'I asked my colleague to help me' to the target language.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
As you said, you ask the colleague to help with your assignment, so she translated the sentences to English and sent these to you, right? So in other saying, the messages are the answers from the assignments?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
這些簡訊都只是我作業的答案而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now we are going to show you the file one, the page 14-16, there are all the content of your messages. Please, check the content. Is that all the answer of your assignments which you ask your colleague to help you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the content of the messages.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的這些簡訊內容全部都是為了協助我完成我的作業
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for the purpose of completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So according to your wife’s ……………what’s your explanation?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific accusation made by the wife.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我覺得我太太想太多了,我知道他對於我養這個家有很多的疑問,我希望庭上可以了解,在我尋求我的碩士學位時,他從來都不曾幫助過我也不曾支持過我,他根本就不願意幫助我去完成我的學業,如果他有那麼易點院易幫助我的心的話,我今天就不用我同事幫我了,我覺得這一切都是因他而起
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of pronouns
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of critical context
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	addition of unnecessary content

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, is there any unhappy thing between you both?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
一開始我們結婚的時候,我們的確有一段快樂的時光,但是問題是……我試著在台灣教葡萄牙語,但是我的授課時數真的一點都不夠,所以我的工作漸漸變成我們兩個之間最大的問題,我們為了這件事情爭吵不休,他不相信我,我為了這件是已經盡的最大的努力了,他真的不了解我有多麼挫折,而且我有多麼想要完成這件事情]
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我試著在台灣教葡萄牙語' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我試著在台灣教授葡萄牙語'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user's frustration and difficult situation faced, which is an important detail in the original text.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So let’s go back to the master degree program. When did your master program start? Is it finished? Or you are in program now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年春天開始的,他是一個兩年的課程,我必須在12月12號之前完成他,但是我並沒有完成這個課程,是因為我同時我還有兼職工作,我並沒有時間去完成這個課程需要的作業跟報告,就像我說的我老婆從來就沒有支持過我,我認為我在追求我的碩士學位期間我很孤單,我覺得很累也很挫折
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我在2010年春天開始的' should be '我在2010年春天開始'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence: '我必須在12月12號之前完成他' should be '我應該在2012年12月完成它'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '但是我並沒有完成這個課程' should be '但是我沒有完成這個課程'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '是因為我同時我還有兼職工作' should be '是因為我同時還有兼職工作'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我並沒有時間去完成這個課程需要的作業跟報告' should be '我沒有時間去完成這個課程需要的作業和報告'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '就像我說的我老婆從來就沒有支持過我' should be '就像我說的，我老婆從來沒有支持過我'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我覺得很累也很挫折' should be '我感到又累又挫折'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So you mean that the program is a two years program? Why didn’t you complete this program?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the speaker's statement about the program being two years long.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
因為我無法完成每個課要求的
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So what is the finished day of your last registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我這個註冊學期是2012年的秋天
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
According to your statement, the finished day of your program is 2012.Dec 5. So after that day, you should not have any statement after that day, right? But the messages between Wang and you is last 6 months after you finished your master degree program. Why?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the program being a master's degree program.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The user used the past tense 'finished' instead of the present tense 'finishes' to match the original text.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成我的碩士學位並不代表我不想要精進我的中文能力阿,就算我沒有完成我的碩士學位,我還是想要精進我的中文能力,所以我還是請我的同事協助我
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of studying on their own after failing the program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '阿' at the end of the sentence instead of after '中文能力'.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Do you mean that even you failed the master program, you still want to polish cjinese competence, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對阿,所以這就是我為什麼要請我同事幫我的原因
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So do you mean that your colleague is like you tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'role model'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是我的家教也是我的好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不只是我的家教，也是我的好朋友。'

你有付錢給她嗎？
Do you pay?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'pay' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'Do you pay?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有阿,但是我曾經說要付錢給他但他說不用
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經說要付錢給他但他說不用'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
So if you didn’t pay her, why did she send you messages? Is she a diligent girl? Is that go beyond co-worker’s relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我說的,他是我非常好的朋友,他用他所有的時間來幫助我,幫助我學習中文
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'she' as '他' (he) instead of '她' (she).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'help' before the object 'me' instead of after.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'learn' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
So do you still teach English in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
對我還在教書
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is Wang still teaching there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
他也還在那教書阿,只是我們不是搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '只是我們不是搭檔了，他也還在那教書阿'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any further investigation? Or do you have to subpoena anyone?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you have any further investigation or do you have to subpoena anyone, prosecutor?'

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena Wang in the 伯元cram school in the next court as the witness. I want her to explain the function of the messages and the relationship between the defendant.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the details of the messages and the purpose of the subpoena.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'I want' instead of 'I hope' to express their desire.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, do you have any evidence that your want the court to investigate for this case?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'your' instead of 'you' in their translation, resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard about that the cram school had take some actions to handle the relationship between them, And they had pursued the woman, Wang, to drop the job. Would the court check this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '補習班' (cram school) as 'court'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'check' at the end of the sentence instead of using it as the main verb.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the actions taken by the cram school to handle the relationship.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the woman, Wang, being persuaded to quit her job.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate? The situation is that your master degree was finished in 2012, Dec 5. It is not the reason to explain the behavior between you and Wang. Particularly, your communication was ….at 9 pm. It was very strange. Do you have any evidence which can help you with your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Particularly, your communication was ….at 9 pm' is incorrect. It should be 'Particularly, your communication was at 9 pm.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'It is not the reason to explain the behavior between you and Wang' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'There is no reason to explain the behavior between you and Wang.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant's interaction with Wang through text messages, which is an important detail in the original text.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我不認為法庭可以為我找到什麼證據幫助我,就像我說的我跟我同事之間的溝通是非常正常的,我只是想要精進我的中文能力而且持續的學習
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'evidence' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court is set to……….4:30 pm, on Jane 9, 2014 as the………… plaintiff and defendant, both of you have to come. If you need…..according to your needs, you can hire the lawyer.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the investigatory procedure for the adultery. The… the plaintiff, Yu-Huwa Chen, has press…press the case. The reason why he filed this case is because she think his…her husband have too… have a very… um… have a very intimate relationship with his crime…crime-school (cram school, 發音不對) co-worker. And plaintiff have found some very intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. And plus, the defendant… her husband is always, er, usually will find some reason for staying in the workplace, or find some excuse go out… go out with this…co-worker? Or use…or use teleconference. And all these information that the plaintiff has collected is…has proved that the relationship between her husband and his co-worker is beyond the average coworker relationship. So, she filed the case. Defendant, your wife think you have a affair with someone else, so she’s want to press a charge for you…press a charge of the adultery. What do you think?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s court, we are… we will mainly focus on… asking the…asking the communication details between the husband and this co-worker. The purpose of this… of today’s court is to try to find out whether or not that the… that the defendant had a real… had a real adultery with…with this, his co-worker.

我明白。

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you been married with your husband? And did you have any child… did you have any kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question about having children.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve been married for four years, and we have no children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
 Did you get married… did you got married in Taiwan? Or in the foreign country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, when he first arrived Taiwan, he wanted to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'when he first arrived in Taiwan' instead of 'when he first arrived Taiwan'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'is' in the sentence. It should be 'I met my husband' instead of 'I met husband'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the verb 'wanted' in the sentence. It should be 'he wanted to teach Portuguese' instead of 'he to teach Portuguese'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So then in the past few years, is what he did for living? …….teach, teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he keep doing that, he kept doing that……teaching Portuguese. But the Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hour is not very stable. Sometimes the period between jobs will be one or two months. So…after that, he want to have a regular income, so he started to teach… so he started to teach English……he wanted to start teach English. But the English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence structure.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in 'he keep doing that'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Inconsistent use of past and present tense.
grammar and structure	article and determiner errors	Missing articles in 'the Portuguese' and 'the English'.

grammar and structure	preposition errors	Incorrect use of preposition 'to' in 'he started to teach English'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	Missing punctuation at the end of sentences.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of details in 'he kept doing that'.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	Repetition of 'he kept doing that'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	Lack of context for 'the period between jobs will be one or two months'.

cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	Literal translation of 'he kept doing that'.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	Informal language used in 'he want to have a regular income'.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wants to… he wants… he wants an advanced degree? Is that he… is that means… is that mean he tried to study a degree in Taiwan
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of '進修' as 'study a degree' instead of 'advanced degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he needed is something related to English teaching. He find a distance learning program on the net. So he don’t… he didn’t have to go to American, America to learn the thing. He can get this degree through distance online learning. So after all the program subject he had learn, he can get his degree. His plan was that through this American degree that he can found a job in Taiwan to teach English.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'So he don’t… he didn’t have to go to American, America to learn the thing.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'have' in the sentence 'So after all the program subject he had learn, he can get his degree.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'to' in the sentence 'His plan was that through this American degree that he can found a job in Taiwan to teach English.'

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So, what is the relationship between your husband and this co-worker he’s having affair with?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'co-worker' was translated as '外遇對象' which means 'affair partner' instead of '同事' which means 'colleague' or 'co-worker'.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-worker in the cram school. The cram school had the teaching style that the Chinese teacher will partner with a foreign teacher, and that co-worker was… is Chinese teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'That co-worker is the Chinese teacher.'

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
So how did you know about this affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'affair' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
 At first, I just noticed that my husband always stay in the cram school to do over-work, I think. I had asked him so many times: it’s just a cram school, how did you have so many works to do? He told me that because this partner teaching, he has to discuss with his partner a lot. At first, I had no doubt. But after a while, I found that he would always get some phones after he got home. And when he got these phones, he won’t talk… he would not talk in front of me, he would go to our study room to take these calls. That’s why I started to doubt the situation. That’s why I checked his phone book.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	over-work should be overtime work
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	partner teaching should be teaching with a partner
omission or addition	omitting important details	the fact that the husband is receiving calls and not talking in front of the wife is omitted
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	the mention of checking the husband's phone book is unnecessary

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
 In the phone book, is there anything unusual?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
His record, there’s a number keep showing… kept showing up. So I got curious, so I checked his messages. After that, that’s when I found that he almost have these text messages with this girl, co-worker, everyday.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the phone number and the frequency of the text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence structure should be 'There's a number that keeps showing up in his record.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation of '一個女的' as 'this girl' is incorrect. It should be translated as 'a girl' or 'a woman'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
It’s just the message, is that serious? Is there improper in these messages?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it’s just a normal message, then nothing will matter. But he’s a married man! How could he let the other sent these so intimate message… intimate sentence to him? I had provided some messages in my evidence to the court. I think it’s all in there.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢?' as 'let the other sent these so intimate message… intimate sentence to him?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages as evidence to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see the record p.13. Here are several messages from your cellphone, please look at it, defendant. Is this from your smartphone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages from the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'look' instead of 'looks' to agree with the subject 'this'.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對，這是從我手機裡拿出來的簡訊。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The translation does not accurately convey the cultural context of the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I’m going to focus on these messages and have several questions for you. The first message is… was dated back to 2011, Nov. 31st, in the… 9:15 in the evening, and it’s from 0958932xxx. (後面翻成中文了囧)
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the date and time

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是一個我的同事傳給我的。我記得那個時候我請了兩天假。她有點擔心。這就是為什麼他要傳這封簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，她的思想非常開放。那就是她講話和表達感情的方式。那至於”我的愛”，我們就是這麼稱呼所在意的人。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'colleague' as '同事' instead of '同事的同事'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'open-minded' as '思想非常開放' instead of '心胸開闊'
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of 'my love' as '我的愛' instead of '親愛的'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean this message sender… because she was… was in the United State, so she’s more westernized? So he…so her way to show her express… to express his emotions is more… open? So, “my love” didn’t mean anything, is that right?
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not accurately translate the idiomatic expression '我的愛' (my love) and failed to convey its intended meaning.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然沒有啊。這就只是兩個感情很好的朋友，或者是很關心彼此的朋友之間的表達方式阿。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
So the former sentence she said?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'former' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，她很擔心我，我們是工作上的夥伴。我請假兩天，她當然會想我啊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們是工作上的夥伴，就像我說的，她很擔心我。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'naturally missed me' is translated as '當然會想我啊', which means 'of course she will think of me'. The correct translation should be '當然會想我啊', which means 'of course she will miss me'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean, she sent these messages just because you took two days off? Without your help in the class, she missed you a lot, is that so?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the person missed the user a lot.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對，最主要就是那個概念，簡訊內容並不重要。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the message was a text message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message, is sent in 2012, Jan. 13th, and is in evening 11:15…11:55, and is from the same person. (後面又翻成中文了orz) Can you tell me what these means? Why would she say something like this?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated the message into Chinese and then back into English, resulting in a distorted meaning.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這封簡訊給我，主要是為了表示…主要是為了表達……怎麼用中文的方式表達。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you these messages to help you on your assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太曾經跟庭上所講過，我正在學習一個美國學位…一個碩士學位。在這個學程裡面，我被要求要完成三十個
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about completing assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you just explain what exactly you’re study for you master program? For you master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位是英語教學。在這個學位裡面，主要是教有關英語教學，但是也會參雜著有關英語能力的學習，以及文化。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you mean you’re getting a TESOL degree, but that can include some English competence, is that right? ……some course about the culture, not English competence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '文化溝通的課程' as 'course about the culture' instead of 'course about cultural communication'.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得至少有三門課是有關於文化和溝通。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
In these culture and communication courses, what assignments did you have?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'did' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
對每個學生來說，文化與溝通功課可能…對每個學生來說，都不一樣啊。就以我自己來舉例，我是一個在台灣試圖教…取得英語教學證明的外國人。為了證明我的能力，我必須證明我的中文能力。所以我有很多中英互翻譯的作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean because you wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so this degree ask you to prove your ability to use… Chinese? So you have to finished the assignment, and this assignment included sentence translation, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '中文' as 'Chinese' instead of 'Chinese language'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'ask' before the subject 'this degree', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of completing assignments as part of the requirement to prove Chinese language ability.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對。而且我還被要求要加強我的口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So back to the former sentence… the former line, you said this is your assignment, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得這個句子。當我拿到這個中文句子的時候，我不知道怎麼把他翻成英文。你知道，有些中國字對外國人來說是很難認的。我需要一些幫助，所以我請我同事幫忙。我請她幫我翻譯這個句子，然後傳簡訊給我…傳答案給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun 'her' is used instead of 'him' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of sending a text message.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the unnecessary detail of asking the colleague to send the answer.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean because you asked her how the sentence was said in…you send her the sentence in Chinese, and she translated it into English for you, and send you the answer, is that right? So this message is an answer for your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
And now please see the p.14 to 16 in the record. Please see the content. Are these all because you ask for help to your assignment, so the other person sent these to you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages on pages 14 to 16.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，這些簡訊全都是為了我的作業。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'assignments' as '作業' is correct, but the word '簡訊' is translated as 'messages' instead of 'tasks' or 'homework'.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So back to the point that you wife said you have an affair with your co-worker, Tsai-yian Wang, what’s your saying?
semantic conversion	word choice errors	The user translated '解釋' as 'saying' instead of 'explanation'.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的事對這件事想太多了。我知道她對於支撐這個家的能力並不是非常滿意。但我希望法院…我希望庭上知道，在我的學習過程中，她從來沒有支持過我。她根本就不願意幫我完成我的學位。如果她能多支持我一點的話，我就不用向我同事求助了。我覺得她才是這整起誤會需要被…最需要…最主要負責的人。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我希望庭上知道' should be '我希望庭上的人知道' to maintain proper sentence structure.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '我希望庭上知道' should be '我希望庭上的人知道' to maintain subject-verb agreement.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning in the sentence: '我覺得她才是這整起誤會需要被…最需要…最主要負責的人' should be '我覺得她應該為這場誤會負責任' to accurately convey the intended meaning.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
So according to you, I think…it seems that there are some friction… friction… fraction between you and your wife

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們剛結婚的時候，確實是一段好時光。但工作是我…是一個很大的問題。我想在台灣教葡萄牙文，但沒辦有有固定的授課時數，所以我的工作就變成了我們兩個之間的問題。我們為了這件事不知道已經吵了幾次架了。她不相信我已經盡了我最大的努力。她完全沒有辦法理解我所遇到的挫折以及我所遇到的問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我們為了這件事不知道已經吵了幾次架了'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
OK. Back to the master degree, the program you just mentioned. Can you tell me when your program begin? Is it end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2010年的春天開始課程。那是個兩年的課程。我應該要在……2012年的12月之前完成課程。但是我並沒有如期完成，因為我…因為我一直在工作，所以我沒有辦法完成我的作業。就像我所說的，我的太太不怎麼支持我。我覺得我只有一個人在為學位奮鬥。我太累而且也太挫折了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我是在2010年的春天開始課程' (I started the program in Spring 2010). The correct word order should be '我在2010年的春天開始了課程'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '我應該要在……2012年的12月之前完成課程' (I should have finished the program in December 2012). The correct tense should be '我應該在2012年的12月之前完成課程'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '因為我…因為我一直在工作，所以我沒有辦法完成我的作業' (because I...because I was working, so I couldn't complete my assignments). The reason for not finishing the program is not mentioned in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'by myself' in the sentence '我覺得我只有一個人在為學位奮鬥' (I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone). The phrase 'by myself' is not included in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'too tired and too frustrated' in the sentence '我太累而且也太挫折了' (I became too tired and too frustrated). The phrase 'too tired and too frustrated' is not included in the translation.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean you… you used to be a two-year program, and you failed to finish it. Why was that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法上完所有必需…要求的課程。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'finish' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
 So your last registration semester, when did it end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個註冊的學期是…2012的秋季班。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'fall' which is an important detail in the original text.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '班' which means 'class' instead of '學期' which means 'semester'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So if what you said was true… everything you said is true, your last course should be end at 2012, Nov. 15th. After that, you should not have any assignment, is that right? But your assignment text between you and your co-worker, kept… continued six months after your courses ended, how is that so?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '合理推斷' as 'if what you said was true' instead of 'reasonable inference'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'everything you said is true' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after 'if what you said was true'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the text being a message or conversation between the person and their co-worker.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有完成那個課程，並不代表我不想增進我的中文能力…我的語言能力呀。雖然我沒有完成指定課程，但我還是想增進我的中文能力，所以我決定自修。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我的語言能力呀，我沒有完成指定課程，但我還是想增進我的中文能力，所以我決定自修。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even you failed to finish that master degree program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'even though you failed to finish that master degree program'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'even you failed' should be 'even though you failed'.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為什麼我請我同事幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So this co-worker is playing a role that can call…can be called your…mentor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'mentor' does not accurately convey the meaning of '家教' (tutor).

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是個家教，她還是個真誠的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有。我曾經提供過這個想法，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經提供過這個想法，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
So, if you didn’t pay her, then why would she still send these message at the hour, at this late hour that she supposed to be rest, to be sleeped, to you? Is that beyond the co-worker obligation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'should be rest, to be sleeped'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in 'to be rest, to be sleeped'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'if you didn't pay her' in the translation
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misinterpretation of 'beyond the co-worker obligation'

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我說的阿，她是一個非常真誠、非常支持的朋友。她利用她自己的私人時間來幫助我學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我說的，她是一個非常真誠、非常支持的朋友。'
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after '就像我說的'. The correct punctuation should be '就像我說的，她是一個非常真誠、非常支持的朋友。'
omission or addition	missing cultural references or idiomatic expressions	The translation does not include the phrase 'using her own time'. This omission changes the meaning of the sentence.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teaching English at that cram school?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'teaching' should be in the present continuous form 'are teaching' to match the subject 'you'.

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我還在那裏工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
And this co-worker, Tsai-yian Wang, still work here?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The subject and verb are in the wrong order.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
對，她還在那裏教書，但我們現在不是搭檔。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們現在不是搭檔' instead of '但我們不是搭檔現在'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Is there any person or investi…investi… evidence that the prosecutor want to do a further investigation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope the court can call this Tsai-yian Wang as the witness to the court. Let her explain the true message behind these texts and why… and why she write…she wrote these messages to him.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the details of the relationship between the witness and the defendant, as well as the background and purpose of the text messages.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'write' instead of 'wrote' in the sentence.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, is there anything the court to do the further investigation for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had some action because of their relationship because of…because both of them. And they even try to persuade Tsai-yian Wang to leave the work. Is it possible to confirm this information to…to that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of '彩燕離職' is not accurately translated as 'leave the work'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the cram school's attempt to persuade Tsai-yian Wang.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there anything you want to court to do the further investigation for you? Now here’s the thing, your degree, your program has already end at 20…2012, Dec. There is really no reason for you to say that your message is because she’s helping you to do your assignment. Especially your message usually were sent after 9 pm. And this is something normal people won’t… wouldn’t do. Do you have any evidence can help this case.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Now here’s the thing, your degree, your program has already end at 20…2012, Dec.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence 'There is really no reason for you to say that your message is because she’s helping you to do your assignment.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Especially your message usually were sent after 9 pm.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Misinterpretation of the phrase '起人疑竇' as 'something normal people won’t… wouldn’t do.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase '你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？' which asks if the defendant has any evidence to help their case.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我覺得庭上沒有甚麼可以為我調查的證據了。就像我說的，我和我同事之間的關係非常簡單，只想增進我的語文能力，學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So, we will dated at 2014, June 9th and in afternoon 4:30 to start to ask the witness. …to starting the procedure asking witness. Plaintiff and the defendant, please be here. If it is necessary, you can have your attorney here, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'So, we will dated at 2014, June 9th and in afternoon 4:30 to start to ask the witness.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '…to starting the procedure asking witness.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'Plaintiff and the defendant, please be here.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense in the sentence 'If it is necessary, you can have your attorney here, do you understand?'

我明白。
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
我明白。

今天庭期到此結束。
So today’s court is adjourned.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. The correct translation should be 'Today's court adjourns.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the word 'here' which is present in the original text.

今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

我了解了

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are her for the preparation procedure for adultery. The plaintiff sued up for the case. It is because her husband John Anderston is in a relation with a teacher from his colleague. The plaintiff found some intimate messages from her husband’s phone. Plus, her husband, the defendant, usually have some excuses to stay in the cram school with his colleague王彩燕, and sometimes has some tele-conferencing. What the plaintiff has collected of the information are actually beyond the colleagues’ relationship. As a result, the plaintiff sued up. Defendant, your wife thinks you have affairs with you colleague. What’s your plead?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'We are her for the preparation procedure for adultery.' It should be 'We are here for the preparation procedure for adultery.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'is in a relation with a teacher from his colleague' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'is having an affair with a colleague from his tutoring class.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the plaintiff's name, Chen Yuhua, in the sentence 'The plaintiff sued up for the case.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the mention of the defendant's name, John Anderston, in the sentence 'The plaintiff sued up for the case.'

Not guilty, of course.
當然沒有阿
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’ preparatory procedure, we are here for asking the messages between the defendant and his colleague. The purpose is to understand the defendant and his colleague really have intimate messages and even adultery. Do both parties of you fully understand your rights?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of '準備程序' as 'preparatory procedure' instead of 'preparation process'

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long do you marry your husband. Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the word 'Plaintiff' at the beginning of the question.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the question about having children.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for 4 years, and we have no kids.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'We have been married for 4 years'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry you husband in Taiwan or foreign countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Did you marry your husband in Taiwan or in a foreign country?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past a few years, did he only work for teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he is a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued his teaching. However, in Taiwan, Portuguese is not a famous English language, which is like English, so his teaching hours is not stable. Sometimes he will have even a period between jobs about two months. Afterwards, in order to make stable income, he started to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English. As a result, he seeks an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	tense errors	inconsistent verb tense usage
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out information about his decision to pursue an advanced degree

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean he want to study a program in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the person wants to study a program in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he has to have a degree of English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California on the internet. So he don’t have to go to school but can have an on-line learning at home. After he finished all he course, he can got the master degree. His plan is that if he got the master degree in Taiwan, then he can also teach English. So what is the relationship between him and the person he has affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'So he don’t have to go to school but can have an on-line learning at home.' The correct word order should be 'So he doesn't have to go to school but can have online learning at home.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the relationship between the protagonist and the person he has an affair with.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
They are colleagues of cram school.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇對象' as 'colleagues of cram school', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '外遇對象' (extramarital affair partner).

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
The cram school plans a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher working together for a program, and the woman is his partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have some affairs?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I just noticed that my husband usually stayed at cram school for over work. I have asked him for many times. It is just a cram school. How could he work so much? He told me because he needs to partner with the Chinese teacher, so they need a lot of time to communicate and discuss. At first, I really didn’t think too much. But later I found he usually got some phone calls after he was home. And he usually picked up his phone in the study room rather with me. It seems like he wants to hide something, so I check his phone book.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'It is just a cram school. How could he work so much?' The correct word order should be: 'How could he work so much? It is just a cram school.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the protagonist checked her husband's phone after suspecting him of hiding something.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Do you find anything weird in his phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone records, I found there is a number showing up for many times, Because I am curious about that, I check his test messages, too. After I checked his text messages, I found they text each other almost every day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person mentioned in the translation is a woman.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Just texting, it is not that serious. Is the content not appropriate?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the seriousness of the content

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If that is just a common message, it’s okay. But he has got married, how could he text the kind of messages with other woman? I have provided some messages to the court. I think they are in the files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '已婚的人' as 'has got married' instead of 'married person'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court and the fact that they are in the files.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please show the evidence record, number 13. Here are some text messages. Defendant, please check it. Are these from your phone’s text messages?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the evidence record number 13 in their translation.

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機裡面的簡訊內容
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I have a few questions about these messages. The first message is from 0958-932-XXX at 9:50 PM on December 31th, 2012, is that right? The content shows “I really miss you, my love.” What did it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那只是我同事傳給我的訊息，我記得那時候我請了兩天假，她只是太擔心了而已，這大概就是她為什麼會傳這樣的簡訊給我的原因，我同事是在美國受教育的，所以她比較開放一點，這就是她平常的說話方式跟表達方式，至於所提到的「我的愛」，只是我們平常用來稱呼我們比較親密在乎的人而已
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean the sender is that westernized because she stayed in United State for many years and the way she expresses herself is quietly open as well. So “my love”, this word means nothing. Is that right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the meaning of 'my love' and assumes it means nothing, when in fact it is a term of endearment.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿，這在好朋友之間是很常見的，而且我們又是這麼熟的朋友
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
What about the sentence she just mentioned?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the previous sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就如同我所說的，她只是擔心我，因為我們是工作上的同事阿，所以我沒去上班幾天，她想我也是滿正常的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of 'naturally missed me' as 'she wanted me'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase '因為我們是工作上的同事阿' (because we are partners at work). The correct word order should be '我們是工作上的同事，因為' (we are partners at work, because).

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean that she sent this message to you just because you are not for work for two days. Because without your assistance, so she missed you a lot. That’s all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對阿就是這樣，簡訊內容根本沒有什麼問題啊
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'The message was no big deal,' the user's translation says 'The message had no problem at all.'

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message is from the same number at23:55 PM on January 13th in 2013. The content of the message is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this message mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這封簡訊的目的只是要問我在中文裡面要怎麼表達這個句子的意思
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the purpose of the message. It misinterprets the intention of the sender.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean she sent this message to you just to help you finish your homework? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
在我太太提告之前，我正準備要完成我的碩士學位，在這課程當中，我必須修滿30個學分才能結業，所以很自然地我當然必須完成一些練習還有作業阿
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what’s your master degree about?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我學的是英語教學，在這課程當中，大部分跟英語教學有關，但有些也跟文化還有語言能力有關
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' which means 'courses' instead of '學程' which means 'program'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'related to' is translated as '有關' which means 'related' instead of '涉及' which means 'involved in' or 'concerned with'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'some' courses being related to culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So what you got your master degree is a TESOL, and there are also some culture programs, right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'in' before 'a TESOL'.
inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user incorrectly translated '文化溝通' as 'culture programs'.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是阿，我記得當中至少有三門課程是跟文化有關係的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So this kind of culture program… what kind of homework will it has?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'it' in the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
關於文化與溝通這方面，可能會因為不同學生而因人而異，拿我自己為例子，我是打算在台灣尋求英語教學資格，為了證明跟表達我自己能力，我必須展現出我對中文的掌握能力，因此在我的作業當中有很多中英互相翻譯的作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean you want to teach English in Taiwan so that the program ask you to prove the language competence of Chinese, is that right? So you have to finish some homework, and the homework is about sentence translating. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'certain' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對阿就是這樣，而且我也同時被要求要精進我自己的聽跟口說能力
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'sharpen' was translated as '精進' which means 'improve' or 'enhance', but it doesn't convey the exact meaning of 'sharpen' in this context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我也同時被要求要精進我自己的聽跟口說能力' instead of '我也同時被要求要精進我自己的聽跟口說能力'.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
OK that’s go back to what we just mentioned. You mean that this is your homework right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is this your homework?'

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿，我還記得那個句子，當我拿到這個中文句子時，我實在不知道怎麼去翻譯，你知道有些中文的字對外國人來說是非常難去理解的，我需要一些協助所以我就請我的同事幫忙，我請她幫我翻譯並把句子傳給我
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You meant that you ask your colleague to tell you what’s the meaning, and she translates into English form and send it to you? In other words, the message is just the content of your homework?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，這封訊息真的只是我作業的答案
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the original text being a court interpreter's analysis of translations.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
That’s take the documentary, the file from page 14 to page 16. Here are some contents of the messages. Please check these messages. Are these all out of your homework so you seek for your colleague’s help and she sent them back to you?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對，所有的簡訊內容都只是幫助完成我的作業
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the messages were for the purpose of completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So what’s your explain about your wife charged you and your colleague王彩燕have an affair?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	charged instead of said
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	have instead of has
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the mention of explanation

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了，我知道她覺得我能力不足以養整個家，我希望庭上了解，在我開始修課之後的所有期間，她從未提供我任何協助，她根本沒有想要幫助我完成學位的意思，如果她願意幫助我的話，我根本不需要向我的同事求助，我覺得她應該為這些所有誤會道歉
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'blamed' as 'apologize'

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your words, it seems like you and your wife have some misunderstanding and even unhappy?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們剛結婚時，一開始我們確實過得很開心，但問題出在我的工作，我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但沒有辦法有穩定的教學時數，所以我的工作變成我們之間的問題、導火線，我們為這件事情吵了很多次，她不肯相信我已經盡全力了，我也沒有辦法讓她了解我所面臨的困境和無力
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我也沒有辦法讓她了解我所面臨的困境和無力'

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok let’s go back to your master degree you just mentioned. When did you start your master degree? Did it end already?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2010年的春季開始上課的，我必須要在12月22日完成這個課程，我並沒有完成我的學業，因為我同時在打工，而且沒有時間做我的作業，
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect verb tense used
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the reason for not finishing the program
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the mention of feeling tired and frustrated
inappropriate cultural transformation	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	failure to translate 'course assignments'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean the term of this program is two years long, but you didn’t finish it. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法修完所有的課程
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'requirement' in the translation.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when did you finish the course?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一次註冊的時間點是2012年的秋季
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'semester' in the original text.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you just mentioned, you course ended on December 5th in 2012, which means you won’t have any homework afterwards. Is that right? But you and your colleague still have some inappropriate messages after you finish your course for six months. What does that mean?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of meaning

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
即使我沒有繼續修課了不代表我沒有繼續增進我語言能力的意思，為了增進我的中文能力，我只能夠靠自己繼續練習下去
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '即使我沒有繼續修課了，不代表我沒有繼續增進我語言能力的意思。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean even you didn’t finish the program you still want to sharpen your Chinese skills?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫忙
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague is just like your tutor, tight?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'tight' does not accurately convey the meaning of '家教' (tutor).

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，她也是我的真心朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經想過但是被她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經想過但是被她拒絕了，沒有。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her anything, why did she send these messages to you so late? Was that too much for a colleague doing this for you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這也是為什麼我說她是一個…很挺我的朋友阿，她用她自己的個人時間來幫助我學習中文
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	挺 (tǐng) should be translated as 'supportive' instead of 'very'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '她是一個很挺我的朋友' instead of '我說她是一個很挺我的朋友'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of learning Chinese, which is an important detail in the original text

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still teaching in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'English' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那裡上班
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
What about your colleague, 彩燕王? Is she still working there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the name is reversed in the translation.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她還在那邊工作，但我們已經沒有再一起搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '但我們已經沒有再一起搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經沒有再一起搭檔了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any further questions or any evidence that you want to ask?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena on 彩雲王, who works for the cram school, and come here to get some information. I would like to understand the background of these text messages between the defendant and his colleague.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague's name, 彩燕王, and instead translated it as 彩雲王.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'on 彩雲王' after 'subpoena', which is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'subpoena 彩燕王'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '證人身分' as 'get some information', which does not accurately convey the meaning of being a witness in court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the purpose of 彩燕王's testimony, which is to explain the relationship between her and the defendant, as well as the background and purpose of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Do you want the court to help you investigate?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the teller's request for the court to investigate any evidence.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had some actions against their affairs. And even the cram school officers tried to ask 彩燕王 to leave the job. Can the court check this from the cram school?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	補習班 officers translated as 補習班

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you? Your work has already ended at December 5th 2012, you have no excuses to text messages with 彩燕王 for finishing assignments. Especially your text interactions are at night after 9 o’clock. That’s weird. Do you have any evidence that can help you with the case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'text messages with 彩燕王 for finishing assignments' should be 'text messages with 王彩燕 for finishing assignments'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage: 'Your work has already ended at December 5th 2012' should be 'Your work ended on December 5th, 2012'.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到任何庭上可以代替我去調查的證據，就如同我所說，我同事跟我之間的傳訊內容就真的這麼單純而已，我只是希望她能過增進我的中文能力，然後幫助我繼續學習中文下去
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the next court date will at 4:30 PM on June 9th in 2014 for the inquiry procedure of the witness. The plaintiff and the defendant, both of you need to show up. If necessary, both of you can have a lawyer.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	2014 should be translated as 103年 (year 103) in the context of the Republic of China calendar.

我明白。
Yes, I understand

I understand.
我明白了

今天庭期到此結束。
OK then we will end the court here
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'today' in their translation.

今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

我了解。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The plantiff, Yu-Hua Chen filed for this case mainly because her husband John Anderson has a very intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school…from a cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cell phone. And…in addition, the defendant often say that…he is going to work extra hours or do tele-conferencing with his colleague, Tsai-Yian Wang. The messages which the plaintiff found…was not only just colleague relationship. As a result, she filed for the case. Defendant, your wife filed an adultery case against you. What’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The plantiff, Yu-Hua Chen filed for this case mainly because her husband John Anderson has a very intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school…from a cram school.' The correct word order should be: 'The plaintiff, Yu-Hua Chen, filed for this case mainly because her husband John Anderson has a very intimate relationship with his colleague from a cram school.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The messages which the plaintiff found…was not only just colleague relationship.' The correct word order should be: 'The messages which the plaintiff found were not just of a colleague relationship.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the defendant's wife suspects him of adultery and wants to charge him with the crime of adultery.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the defendant's wife found intimate messages in his cell phone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the defendant's wife found evidence of late-night video calls or other forms of communication with his colleague.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the defendant's wife collected communication content that went beyond a colleague relationship.

Not guilty, of course.
當然是無罪。

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
Today this procedure…we’re going to confirm the details of the messages of the defendant and his colleague. We would like to make sure that if they really committed adultery and constitute the crime of adultery. Do both of you understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '詢問' as 'confirm' instead of 'ask'.

我明白
 I understand.

I understand.
我明白。

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you and your husband been married? Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years. We don’t have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you and your husband get married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
My husband and I met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and taught Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'My husband and I met each other in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the husband came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past few years, is his job teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued teaching Portuguese. However, in Taiwan Portuguese is not that popular, so his teaching hours was not…teaching hours were not that stable. Sometimes he has periods between jobs for like…one or two months. After that, in order to get more stable income, he decided to start teaching English. However, his mother tongue is not English…he decided to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The subject 'teaching hours' is plural, so the verb should be 'were' instead of 'was'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in past tense to match the past context of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the husband's decision to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You said that he was going to seek for an advanced degree, do you mean that he’s going to study a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of '進修' as 'seek for an advanced degree' instead of 'study further'

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he hoped that he could teach English, he had to get a degree of teaching…English teaching. He found a distance learning program on the internet which is provided by California. In this case, he didn’t have to go to the United States. He only had to do online learning. After he got all the credits, he can get…master degree. His plan is that after he got this English teaching degree, he can teach English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Because he hoped that he could teach English, he had to get a degree of teaching…English teaching.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'He found a distance learning program on the internet which is provided by California.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'In this case, he didn’t have to go to the United States.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'After he got all the credits, he can get…master degree.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence 'Because he hoped that he could teach English, he had to get a degree of teaching…English teaching.'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice in the sentence 'After he got all the credits, he can get…master degree.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the detail that the distance learning program is for English teaching.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what is his relationship with this person he has an affair with?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word '外遇' (affair) in the translation.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are colleagues…in cram school…in the cram school he works for. The plan of the cram school is that foreign teacher partner with Chinese teacher, and that woman is his partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know that they committed…he committed adultery?

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
In the beginning, I just found that he stayed at school to work extra hours. I asked him several times: it’s just an English cram school, what is the need of working extra hours? He told me that because he had to partner with the Chinese teacher, he had to spend much time to communicate…spend much time communicating. In the beginning, I didn’t doubt him at all. However, I found that he often had some phone calls after work. When he got the phone call, he would never talk in my presence, he would go to the study room. This…I doubt because of this, so I checked his cell phone.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'because he had to partner with the Chinese teacher, he had to spend much time to communicate'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'he often had some phone calls after work'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'in the beginning' in the sentence 'In the beginning, I didn’t doubt him at all.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'I doubt because of this' in the sentence 'This…I doubt because of this'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'so I checked his cell phone' in the sentence 'so I checked his cell phone'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
What did you see in his cell phone then? Something unusual…anything unusual?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I often see the same number in his calling record, so I was quite curious and looked at his messages…checked his messages. After I checked his cell phones, I found that he messaged with this…with a woman every day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'cell phone' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
What is big about sending messages? Is the content not appropriate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
 If it’s something very usual, I won’t really care, but he’s a married man, how can he let the other one send messages which is a bit…vague? In the past, I have already provided some contents of the messages. They should be in the documents.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '很親密的字句' as 'vague', which does not accurately convey the intended meaning of 'intimate words'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court, which is an important detail in the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please look at page 13 of the document. Here are some contents…here of the contents of the messages. Defendant, please take a look. Is these…are these the messages in your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，是我簡訊的內容。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'message' is translated as '內容' which means 'content' instead of '簡訊' which means 'text message'.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
So now I’m going to focus on the content of the messages…I’ll ask you some questions. The message is send by the phone number 0958-932*** in November 31st, 2012 at 9:50 PM. The content is “我非常想念你,”What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
就是我同事傳的啊。我記得那個時候我請了兩天假，她有點擔心。那就是為什…所以她才傳這樣的簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，所以很開明…開放，那就是她講話的方式。就是…「my love」這樣的詞就只是我們叫我們關心的人的方式。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我記得那個時候我請了兩天假，她有點擔心。'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '那就是為什麼她才傳這樣的簡訊給我。'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我的同事是在美國受教育的，所以很開明。'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就是...「my love」這樣的詞就只是我們叫我們關心的人的方式。'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that this woman stayed abroad, so her thoughts are more westernized? And the way her…she expressed her feelings is more…open-minded? So the phrase “my love” doesn’t really mean anything, right?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對啊，那是好朋友之間，或是很關心彼此的朋友表達的方式…稱呼彼此的方式。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous sentence?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我就說了，她…她很關心我，我們是工作上的好夥伴。當我請假兩天，他很自然地就會想念我啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
 You mean that the woman sent you this message just because you took two days off? Because you didn’t…you weren’t there to help her in class, she missed you? Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，內容就是這樣子，根本沒什麼大不了的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'no big deal', the user's translation says '根本沒什麼大不了的', which means 'it's not a big deal at all'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
So let’s look at the second message which is sent at 11:55 PM, January 13th, 2013 by the same person. 內容是我想要你在我身邊，我們什麼時候可以在一起？What does this mean? Why do you have that sentence in your cell phone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫那句話是想告訴我一句中文該怎麼說。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you this message because she was helping you finishing your homework. What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我妻子提到的，我現在正在修碩士課程。在那個學位中，我要修完三十個學分才能拿到學位。那我當然就要…完成一些練習、作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '修完' (complete) should come before the object '三十個學分' (30 credits).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about needing to complete assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you please explain which program you are studying?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士課程是英語教學。這個課程主要就是英語教學，然後還會有一些文化語言…文化方面的東西還有語言能力等等。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '碩士' (master's degree) was translated as 'program' instead of 'programme' or 'course'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'TESOL' in their translation, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'some of the courses' in their translation, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'English teaching' in their translation, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'culture and language competence' in their translation, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'related to' in their translation, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'and others' in their translation, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'were related to' in their translation, which is an important detail.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'and language competence' in their translation, which is an important detail.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you’re studying for the TESOL program, so there are some cultural lessons in that program, is that true? Is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'TESOL' in their translation.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，我記得至少有三門課是跟文化與溝通有關的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what kind of assignments do you have from these cultural communication course?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'from' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'have' before the subject 'you' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
對每個學生來說，這堂課的作業都不太一樣。我以我自己來說的話，我是在台灣然後想要成為一位英文老師。為了要拿到這個學位、表示我有能力，我也要證明說我的中文是很好的。所以很多我作業的內容都是中英翻譯的句子。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '對每個學生來說，這堂課的作業都不太一樣' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這堂課的作業對每個學生來說都不太一樣'.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Do you mean that you plan to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove that you have sufficient Chinese competence, is that right? So you have to finish some assignments in class, and these assignments are about translating sentences…between Chinese and English, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of assignments being about translating between Chinese and English.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對啊，我也被要求就是要增進我的口語表達和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s go back to the previous sentence. You said that they’re your assignments, right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'are' should agree with the plural subject 'assignments', not 'they'.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對啊，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這些…就是中文的句子的時候，我不知道英文怎麼講。你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說實在是太難了。我需要一些幫忙，所以請我的同事幫我。我請她翻譯一下那個句子，然後傳簡訊給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you said that you didn’t know the meaning of that sentence, so you ask your colleague to send you the translation in English by message, is that right? So the content of the message is the answer of your assignment, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那個就是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
So how about…let’s look at the content of the messages on page 14 to 16 on the document. Please check the content. Is these messages sent by your colleague because you need help doing your assignment?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，所有的內容都是我要做作業所以傳的。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So what do you want to say to your wife saying that you committed adultery with your colleague, Tsai-Yan Wang.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我覺得她真的想太多了，關於這件事情。我知道她對我…對我照顧家庭的狀況不滿意。我想要讓法院知道的是，從我說我想要修這個學位開始，她就沒有提供任何的支持。她根本就不想要幫助我完成學位。如果她沒有這麼…如果她支持我的話，我就不會去尋求我同事的幫助。我覺得會產生這些誤會都是她的問題。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	照顧家庭的狀況 -> supporting the family
omission or addition	omitting important details	never shown any support -> 沒有提供任何的支持
omission or addition	omitting important details	was not willing to help me complete my degree -> 不想要幫助我完成學位
omission or addition	omitting important details	If she had been a bit more supportive -> 如果她支持我的話
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	blamed for all this misunderstanding -> 產生這些誤會都是她的問題

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your words, the relationship between you two is a bit unpleasant, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛開始結婚的時候，確實相處得還不錯。但是問題就是…但是問題就是我的工作。我試著要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是授課時數就是不夠。然後我們兩個的關係就是因為我的工作變得不太好。我們為了這件事情…常常為了這件事情爭吵。她不相信我已經盡我所能了。我沒有辦法讓他了解我的…有多沮喪然後遇到的困難是什麼。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '但是問題就是…但是問題就是我的工作' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是問題就是我的工作…但是問題就是'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我們為了這件事情…常常為了這件事情爭吵'. The correct form should be '我們為了這件事情…常常為了這件事情而爭吵'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我沒有辦法讓他了解我的…有多沮喪然後遇到的困難是什麼' is a mismatched meaning. The correct translation should be '我沒有辦法讓她了解我所面臨的挫折和困難'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'stable teaching hours' in the sentence '我試著要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是授課時數就是不夠'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'from time to time' in the sentence '我們為了這件事情…常常為了這件事情爭吵'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
OK, let’s go back to the master degree you were talking about. When did you start studying for your master degree. When did it end? Did you get the degree already?…Have you got the degree already?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Have you already got the degree?'

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我本來是在2010年的春天開始的…一開始。那是兩年的課程。我本來是應該是在2012年的12月完成這個學位。我之所以沒有準時拿到是因為我要工作…然後沒有辦法有時間去寫我的作業。就像我剛剛說的，我的老婆一直都沒有很支持我。我覺得我根本就是一個人在追求這個學位，我覺得很累很沮喪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我本來是在2010年的春天開始的…一開始'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '我本來是應該是在2012年的12月完成這個學位'
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Incorrect pronoun usage in the sentence '我之所以沒有準時拿到是因為我要工作'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '然後沒有辦法有時間去寫我的作業'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我覺得我根本就是一個人在追求這個學位'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You said that this was a two-year program, and you didn’t finish it. Why is that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法完成所有的課程…修完所有的課程。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'requirement' which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '修完' (complete) before the noun '所有的課程' (all the courses), resulting in incorrect word order.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When did the semester you last registered ended?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
恩…是在2012月四月。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'fall 2012' as 'April 2012', which does not match the intended meaning.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So…as you said, according to your saying, the course ended on December 5th, 2012. After that…you won’t have…you didn’t really have assignments, right? But the messages between you and colleague continued until…continued for another six months. Why is that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect understanding of the original text

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我或許沒有想要把那個課程修完，但不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。就算我沒有修完那個學位，我還是想要增進我的中文能力，所以我開始自學。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我或許沒有想要把那個課程修完，但不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even though you haven’t finished your English, you still want to let your Chinese become more fluent, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistakenly translated '中文' as 'Chinese' instead of 'English'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'haven't' instead of 'haven't finished', resulting in a subject-verb agreement error.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，所以為什麼我請我同事幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So this colleague is somehow like…a tutor of yours, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不是只是一個家教而已，而且還是一個真正的好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我曾經要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我曾經要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
 If you didn’t pay her, why does she send messages in the middle of the night with such effort? Is that beyond colleague…relationships between colleagues?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我說這個朋友很支持我啊。她用她自己的時間幫助我學中文。

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English at that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Do you still teach English at that cram school?'

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我還在那裡工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is this woman, Tsai-Yan Wang your colleague, still working there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is this woman, Tsai-Yan Wang, still working there?'

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
對啊，她還在那裡工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是搭擋了' instead of '但已經不是搭擋了我們'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you want to investigate any further evidence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena Wang…Tsai-Yan Wang, the colleague of the defendant, who works at Bo-Yuan Cram School. I hope that she can explain her relationship with the defendant and in what situation…under what circumstances are these messages sent.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Defendant, do you…what other evidences do you want us to investigate?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff as the one asking the question.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has taken some action concerning the relationship between them. And the cram school even asked the woman, Tsai-Yan Wang, to leave her job. Is it possible for…to check with the cram school about this matter?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '試圖說服' as 'asked'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '彩燕離職一事' (Tsai-Yan Wang leaving her job)

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Now, defendant, do you want to ask the court to investigate any evidence for you? The situation is…you have already completed…the courses have already been completed on December 5th, 2012. There…it is not acceptable that doing assignment is an excuse for Tsai-Yan Wang sending messages to you. Especially the time you send messages is always after 9 PM, that is quite doubtful. Do you have evidence which can help you with your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence structure should be 'The situation is that your master's degree has already ended on December 5th, 2012.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋' as 'it is not acceptable that doing assignment is an excuse' is incorrect. The correct translation should be 'there is no reason to use doing assignments as an excuse to explain'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence structure should be 'Especially, most of your message interactions with Wang Tsai-Yan happen after 9 PM, which raises suspicion.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '實在起人疑竇' as 'that is quite doubtful' is incorrect. The correct translation should be 'which raises suspicion'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of 'any evidence' in the question 'Do you have evidence which can help you with your case?'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到任何法庭可以為我調查的證據。就像我說的，我們傳簡訊的原因非常簡單，我只是想要增進我的語言能力，然後繼續學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想不到任何法庭可以為我調查的證據。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation of 'the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the communication was for the purpose of improving language ability and learning Chinese.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So…the next court will be set at 4:30 PM, June 9th, 2014. We will inquire the witnesses. Plaintiff, defendant, both of you please come to the court. If it is necessary, you can both have lawyers, is that OK?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Plaintiff, defendant, both of you please come to the court.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the 'witnesses' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation leaves out the mention of the 'inquiry' or 'questioning' of the witnesses in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the mention of the 'procedure' or 'process' of the witness questioning in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not specify that the court session is in the afternoon.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not mention the specific date of the court session.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the mention of the time of the court session.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not mention that both parties can have lawyers if necessary.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the phrase '明白嗎？' which means 'Do you understand?' in the original text.

我明白。
I understand.

I understand.
我了解。

今天庭期到此結束。
OK, this will be the end of this preparatory procedure.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparation procedure, we are going to ask questions about the relationship between the defendant and the co worker. The purpose is to find out whether the defendant has violated the criminal crime which is adultery and……..do the both parties understand?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the communication that will be asked about.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'are going' instead of 'is going', resulting in subject-verb agreement error.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'criminal crime' instead of 'adultery', resulting in a mismatched meaning.

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long has you been married with your husband? Do you have a child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'has' should be 'have' to agree with the subject 'you'.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married ofr 4 years and we don’t have a child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'we have' instead of 'we don't have'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
So Did you married your husband in Taiwan or at other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you marry your husband in Taiwan or in other countries?'

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We meet ,…I met mu husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan because he wanted to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'We meet ,…I met mu husband in Taiwan.' is incorrect. It should be 'We met, I met my husband in Taiwan.'

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past years, his job is a Portuguese teacher, isn’t he?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'is' should be in the past tense to match the time frame mentioned in the original text.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a language in Taiwan that many people want to learn so his teacher hour is not stable. Sometimes he will have a period between jobs and the period may aim up to one or two months. So… hu… he started to teach English because he wants to have a more stable income. However, his mother tongue is not English so he decided to seek an advanced degree class for English.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'So… hu… he started to teach English' is incorrect.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The use of 'aim' instead of 'may' in the sentence 'Sometimes he will have a period between jobs and the period may aim up to one or two months' is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband decided to seek an advanced degree class for English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that he would like to seek an advanced degree, do you mean that he want a degree n Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the person wants to pursue a degree in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No , because he wanted to teach English , so what ..the degree he need is TESOL which means teaching English for speakers of other language .he found a distance teaching program in America …..in California, America on the internet. So he could finish the program by online learning,,, without …. He didn’t have to fly to America. After he finished the program, he could get a master degree. His plan was to … to get a degree by.. by finish finish …the program.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of TESOL as 'English teaching'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the specific program name 'TESOL'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the mention of online learning
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the mention of not needing to go to America
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the mention of getting a master's degree
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the mention of finding a job as an English teacher in Taiwan

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what is the relationship between the husband and the co- worker.
semantic conversion	omission of details	missing information about the co-worker's relationship with the husband

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are classmates in the cram school.The cram school provide teachers both Chinese teachers and foreign teachers. And the woman is a partner with my husband in the cram school.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '同事' as 'classmates' instead of 'colleagues'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '中師' as 'Chinese teachers' instead of 'Chinese teacher'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the cram school arranges for Chinese and foreign teachers to work together.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the woman is the user's husband's partner in the cram school.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
Hw do you know they have intimate relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'intimate relationship' instead of 'affair'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
First I found that my husband always stay late at the cram shoo. I asked him many times that it was just a English cram school why did he stay so long in the school? He told me that he had to partner the Chinese teacher, the woman so they have to corporate with each other, there are many things to be dealed. At first I did not doubted him. But after some time, I found that he always pick some calls after he came home. And he didn’t pick up the phone in form of me, he usually go to the study room for picking the phones. Then so I suspect.. those are the reasons I suspect him. So I checked his cell phone.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in multiple sentences.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in 'there are many things to be dealed.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in 'I found that my husband always stay late at the cram shoo.'
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	Adding unnecessary information in 'the woman so they have to corporate with each other'.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	Leaving out critical context in 'those are the reasons I suspect him.'
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	Inserting content not present in the original text in 'So I checked his cell phone.'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything unusual in this cell phone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of what they found unusual in the cell phone.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I saw one number appeared form time to time. I was curious about that so I checked his text messages too. After I checked that I found he almost has text messages with that woman every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '常常看到' as 'appeared form time to time' instead of 'often saw'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in 'I saw one number appeared form time to time'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person checked the text messages because they were curious

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Though they are text messages… that are fine right? Or the content is not appropriate?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation misinterprets the meaning of the original text and adds a question about the appropriateness of the content.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it is just a normal message, that will be fine. But he is a married man. How could he let a woman send intimate messages to him? I had provided some messages content that they should be in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '讓對方發一些很親密的字句' as 'let a woman send intimate messages to him' instead of 'let the other party send some intimate words'.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please check investigatory file 1 page13In this file, here are some messages record, defendant, please checkArte these same messages with those messages in your phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對這是我手機裡的簡訊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I am going to ask some questions about those messages.The first text message was send on 9:50 in the evening on 11/31,2012. Form a number which is 0958-932===. The content is 我非常的想你 請你解釋這是什麼意思
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這次我一個同事發的 我記的那天 我休了兩天假 她是很擔心吧 所以她才會那封寄簡訊給我 我同事在美國受教育 她很開放 那是他講話表現 至於我的愛 那就是我們對我們關心的人的稱呼
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean the person who sends this message had stayed in the US so she is westernialized? And she is open-minded in expressing herself her emotions. So these words “my love did not mean a lot, isn’t it?”
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the term 'westernized' and its impact on the person's expression of emotions.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user does not accurately convey the meaning of '我的愛' (my love) in the context of the original text.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
這在好朋友之間的使用很正常
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the previous sentence she type?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'type' in their translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的 他很關心我 我們是公事上的夥伴 當我休了兩天假的後 他很自然就想我拉
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就像我說的，他很關心我。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'partners' is translated as '夥伴' which means 'partners' in a general sense, but in the context of work, it should be translated as '合作夥伴' or '工作夥伴'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was away for two days. The correct translation should include this detail.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean she send this message to you just because you were  you took two days off? Because without your corporation or assistance, she missed you? is that all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '上班' as 'corporation' instead of 'work'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對這就是簡訊就沒什麼 內容很正常
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '對這就是簡訊就沒什麼' does not capture the idea of 'no big deal' in the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was send to you at 11:55 in the evening, 1/31, 2013. It was also form the same number. 內容是我想要你在身邊 我們什麼時候才能真正在一起 please explain it? Could you tell me why she send it to you?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫那封簡訊是為了告訴我中文作業該如何表達
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean she send this message to you mainly for helping you with your assignment, what do you mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太已經告訴法官 我正在參加一個含授課程 在那個城裡我被一球要修滿302個學分 我才能結業 當然我也需要做一些練習還有作業
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '城裡' is incorrect and does not convey the meaning of 'program'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '修滿30個學分' instead of '修滿302個學分'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about needing to complete assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you explain what are you studying for your master degree?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是英語教學 在這個學程裡有一些是關於英語教學 文化還有一些是語言能力的
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '碩士學位' is translated as 'program' instead of 'degree'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '在這個學程裡' is translated as 'in that program' instead of 'in this program'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that 'some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence'.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So the degree you are taking is English teaching but you still have some culture communication lessons? Is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'in' before 'English teaching' in the translation.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對 我記得至少有三堂課程是跟文化溝通有關的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So could you tell me what assignment was given in this culture and communication courses?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
每個學生的文化溝通作業不盡相同 以我來說 我是一個在台灣的學生 而且我想要拿到 英語教學的學位   為了達到這個目標 我必須展現我的語言能力 由其是中文的掌握 所以我的很多作業是關於中文英文的翻譯
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean because you plan to teach English in Taiwan so the master degree asks you ti have some certificate for the language competence is that right? So you have to finish some assignment and the assignment is about Chinese and English translation, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of completing assignments as part of the course.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對 沒錯 我還被要求要加強我的寫作和口語能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok lets go back to the question that you said it was your assingmnet
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對我記得那句話 當我拿到這個句子 我不知道要怎麼把它翻成英文你知道 對於外國人來說有些中文字很難理解 我需要一些幫助 所以我請我的同事幫我 我請她幫我翻譯那些話而且用簡訊寄給我
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part where they asked their colleague to translate the sentence for them.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added unnecessary information about using a text message to receive the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '翻譯' (translate) before the object '那些話' (those words), which is incorrect in English.
grammar and structure	preposition errors	The user used the preposition '用' (with) instead of '給' (to) when expressing 'sent me the answer'.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean you asked her to translate it for you, so she sent it in message to you, is that right? So the message is only the answer for the translation question?

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊的內容就是我翻譯題的答案
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the message was a text message.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
And now please check investigatory file 1 page 14-16 All of these content. Please check this content. All of these message are sent on the purpose ofhelping you with the homework so you have got the messages.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對 所有這些簡訊目的都是為了完成我所有的作業
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '所有' (all) after the verb '完成' (complete), which is incorrect word order in Chinese.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So as for the suspect that your wife suspect you to have a affair with 王彩華 what will you say about that?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	王彩燕 (Wang Caiyan) was translated as 王彩華 (Wang Caihua)

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太想太多了 我知道他對於我養家的能力不是很滿意我想要讓法院知道的是 它在我一開始參加這個課程時 一點都不支持我 她跟本不願意幫助我完成我的學位 如果她能更支持我一點 我就不用去問我的同事要答案了 我覺得她要為全部的誤解負責任
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'support'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'never shown any support'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'she was not willing to help me complete my degree'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'I would not have asked my colleague to help me'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding'

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you just said  I thought you may have some fights with your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們婚姻一開始的時候 我們的確曾有過一些很好的時光但我的工作一直是個問題 我試著在台灣蕉葡萄牙文 但工作時數一值不是很穩定 之後我的工作變成我們吵架的原因 我們之間的問題我們會這是三不五時就會吵架  他不相信我已經盡力了 而且我沒有辦法壤她知道我的挫折還有沮喪
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我們會這是三不五時就會吵架'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omits the phrase 'let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok now let’s turn back to the degree you just mentionedWhen did you start the program did you get the degree?When will it end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010 春天開始這個課程那是一個兩年的課程 我本來在12/22應該完成這個課程 我沒有完成學位因為我有再打工 所以我沒有完成課程所要求的作業  就像我說的 我太太一直沒有很支持我 我感覺我是自己再硬撐著拿到那學位 我後來變得很累而且很挫折
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我在2010 春天開始這個課程那是一個兩年的課程'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the specific month in the sentence '我本來在12/22應該完成這個課程'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not completing the program in the sentence '我沒有完成學位因為我有再打工'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the specific date in the sentence '我沒有完成學位因為我有再打工 所以我沒有完成課程所要求的作業'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the specific reason for feeling tired and frustrated in the sentence '我後來變得很累而且很挫折'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean the program is a two year term program but in the end you did not finish it, why ?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒有辦法達到課程要求
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when did the last semester that you registered end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期結束在2012年秋天
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'last' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So if you are telling the truth, the end of the semester is at 12/5,2012 after that you would not have any assignment for the course. But the messages between you and the co-worker still continue for 6 months after you finished ….. you stop the program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the program or course that the conversation is referring to.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒有拿到學位 但不代表我不想要提升我的語言能力 雖然我沒有拿到學位但我仍想要讓我的中文變好所以我自己學中文
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they failed the program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '學中文' (study Chinese) at the end of the sentence instead of after '我自己' (on my own).

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that although you did not complete the degree but you still want to upgrade your Chinese language ability so that you could speak a more fluent Chines, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對 這就是為什麼我請我同事幫忙
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the co worker is as a tutor for you in your case?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是一個家教更像一個朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有 我有提議要付她錢 但她拒絕
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有提議要付她錢，但她拒絕。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you did not pay her why did she have to reply the message at midnight the time that people should have already fallen asleep? Is this already beyond things that a co worker should do?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '付錢給她' as 'pay her' instead of 'did not pay her'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'did not pay her' after 'If' instead of before it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '如果你沒有' which means 'if you did not'.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
那就是為什麼我說她是一個非常支持我的朋友他用他所有時間來幫助我學中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是一個非常支持我的朋友，她用她所有的時間來幫助我學中文。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'own' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English at that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Do you still teach English at that cram school?'

Yes, I am still working there.
對我仍然在那工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does the co worker 王采燕still work there ?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Does 王采燕 still work there?'

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也在那工作 不過我們不再是夥伴
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不過我們不再是夥伴' instead of '不過我們不再是夥伴'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor , is there anything evidence that you want the court to investigate or anyone witness ?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like to subpoena王采燕who is working at the 伯元 cram school to be in court as a witness. And we would want her to explain the relationship she had between her and the plaintiff and we want her to explain the relationship or background information for the messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant and only mentioned the plaintiff.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'plaintiff' instead of 'defendant' in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the purpose of the messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the witness or evidence that the plaintiff wants the court to investigate.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school had done some actions because of the relationship they have and the cram school even tried to persuade 王采燕to quit her job . I would like to verify this with the cram school.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '女王彩燕' as '王采燕'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'more' before 'actions'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'even' before 'tried to persuade'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'that' before 'the cram school'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'if' before 'I would like to verify this'

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? The situation now is that the program is end on 12/5, 2012 . There is no reason that you could explain the relationship you and the co worker for helping the assignment. Especially, the interaction always start at 9:00 in the night. It is very doubtful.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'The situation now is that the program is end on 12/5, 2012.' It should be 'The situation now is that the program ended on 12/5, 2012.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'There is no reason that you could explain the relationship you and the co worker for helping the assignment' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'There is no reason for you to explain the relationship between you and your coworker in relation to the assignment.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Especially, the interaction always start at 9:00 in the night.' It should be 'Especially, the interaction always starts at 9:00 at night.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'It is very doubtful' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'It raises suspicions.'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到法院能找到幫助我的證據 就像我說的我和同事間的簡訊非常平常 我只是想要提升我的中文能力且繼續學中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the object.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court day is set at 4:30 in the afternoon, 6/9, 2014 To do the inquiry for the witness. Both the plaintiff and the defendant should be in court on that day. Is necessary, both of you have a right to a lawyer, do you understand?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	incorrect date and year
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'if necessary'

我瞭解。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today this is the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. This case was filed by the plaintiff, Yu-hua Chen. The main reason for doing so is because the plaintiff’s husband is beyond a workers’ relationship.The plaintiff has discovered intimate messages in the defendants’ text mailbox. In addition, the defendant would make excuses … often make excuses to stay after work and frequently teleconference with his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang.…The information the plaintiff collected proves that the relationship is beyond a working relationship between colleagues.Therefore, she filed the case. The defendant, your wife accuses you of adultery. What’s your plea?
semantic conversion	word choice errors	mismatched meaning
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	missing subject-verb agreement
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of critical context

Not guilty, of course.
我當然是無罪啦。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In our preparatory procedure today, our main goal is to inquire the details of the messaging between the defendant and your colleague. Our objective today is to make sure that the defendant really is committing adultery with a colleague. Are the two parties aware of the procedure?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the inquiry, which is to determine if the defendant and their colleague are having an extramarital affair.

我明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff, how long have you been married to your husband. Do you have any children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years. We don’t have any children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Were you married in Taiwan or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. 4 years ago he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '4 years ago he came to Taiwan' instead of '4 years ago he came to Taiwan'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the recent years, he… has been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb tense should be present perfect continuous (has been teaching) instead of simple past (has taught).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation incorrectly states that he has been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan, while the original text only mentions that his work in Taiwan has been related to Portuguese.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we just met, he was a Portuguese Teacher. After we were married, he continued to teach Portuguese. Portuguese is not a language popular among Taiwanese so his teaching hours were… unstable.Sometimes he would have empty…hours up to two months.Afterwards, to obtain a more stable income, he began to teach English. But English was not his mother tongue so he decided to seek advanced education.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the husband's decision to seek advanced education.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverbial phrase 'up to two months' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '空窗期' as 'empty hours' instead of 'period of inactivity'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the husband's decision to teach English.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverbial phrase 'to obtain a more stable income' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek advanced education' instead of 'further education'.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
By advanced education, do you mean he sought a degree in Taiwan?
minor categories of semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation incorrectly assumes that '進修' means 'sought a degree' in this context, which is a cultural transformation error.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Since he wished to teach English in Taiwan, the degree he sought must be related to English Education. He found a long distance online course from California of the United States… online. So he didn’t need to go to America in person to take the class. So when he obtains all his credits, he also gets his masters degree. His plan was to find an English teacher position in Taiwan through getting a degree from the United States.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'He found a long distance online course from California of the United States… online.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the online course is provided by a university in California.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the protagonist can complete the course through correspondence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the protagonist can obtain a master's degree after completing all the credits.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the protagonist's goal is to find an English teaching job in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is the relationship he has with the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are collegues at the cram school. The cram school has a policy to partner up mandarin teachers and foreign teachers. That woman is the mandarin teacher partnered up with him.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they were in an affair

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first I only found that my husband often stayed long after work hours. I asked many times: It was only an English cram school, why would he need to stay so often after work? He told me that since he had to partner up with a Mandarin teacher, there had to be much effort put in to communicating with each other. At first I didn’t suspect anything at all. Later on, I found that after he would come home, he would receive phone calls. When he picks up the phone, he would never talk on the phone in person, but go to his study room instead. Because of this, I began to suspect him, so I inspected his phone record.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about the wife's suspicion and checking her husband's phone record.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
…Did you find anything unusual in his cellphone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user changed the word order in the translation, resulting in an incorrect sentence structure.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his call records, there was… one number that frequently appeared. So I was… curious and began to inspect his text messages, too. And then I realized he was texting a woman almost everyday.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific information about the number that frequently appeared in the call records.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'was' instead of 'were' to agree with the plural subject 'call records'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '查' as 'inspect' instead of 'check' or 'look up'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the user's curiosity.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the realization that the person was texting a woman.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Is it really that serious?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it’s a normal, an usual text then there wouldn’t be any problem. But he is a married man, how could he let another person send intimate messages to him like that? Previously, I’ve sent some copies of their text messages of theirs to the court, they should be in the evidence right now.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '普通的簡訊' as 'normal, an usual text' instead of 'normal text messages'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '已婚的人' as 'married man' instead of 'married person'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing copies of the text messages to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Evidence number one, please. Page 13. There are a few message contents in here. May the defendant please take a look at them? Are these the text messages that are in your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對，這是我手機裡的簡訊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then I have some questions to ask you about these messages. The first text message was sent from the phone number 0958-932XXX at 9:50 PM of November 21st 2012. The content is: “I really miss you, my love.” What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
呃，這是我同事寄給我的。我記得我當時有兩天沒去上班。她有點擔心我。所以才傳這封簡訊給我。我的同事去美國留過學，所以非常開放，這是她講話的方式。至於她稱呼我為「my love」,這只是他對在乎的人表達的意思。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural expression

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So you mean the person who sent this message was educated in America, she’s more westernized. She’s more open with expressing her affections. So, by calling you my love there isn’t any meaning?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of calling someone 'my love' and assumes it has no special meaning.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
不，這是好朋友之間很常有的用語，只是表達對彼此的在乎。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
What about the previous message before this… name?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the previous message before asking about the name.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我先前提到的，她只是為我擔心而已，我們是同事的關係。我有兩天沒去上班，她自而然地…為我擔心。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The adverbial phrase '就像我先前提到的' should come after the subject '她'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '只是為我擔心而已' is translated as 'just worried about me'. However, the original text implies that she naturally missed the speaker, not just worried about them.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
What you mean is the only reason for her doing so is you took two days off from work? And because you were not there to help her in class, she missed you? Is that it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，那就是整件事情的脈絡。沒什麼大不了的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
All right. The second text message was also sent from the same cell phone number from 11:55pm of January 13th 2013. Inside the text message, it says, “I want to be by your side, when can we be truly together?” What does this mean? Why would a message like this appear in your cellphone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I want you by my side' as 'I want to be by your side'

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這個訊息給我是想要告訴我我作業裡的回答要怎麼講。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean she sent you this text message to help you with your homework? What do you mean by that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我妻子在法庭中提到的，我當時在修一堂課。那堂課需要修滿30個學分我才能取得學位，所以我當然需要完成一些作業和練習。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you please elaborate on what you really are learning for your masters?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我修的是英語教育的課程。期中，有些課程是漢英語教學相關。有的是漢西方文化或語言能力有關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我修的是英語教育的課程。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'TESOL' as '英語教育的課程' is incorrect. TESOL stands for 'Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages', not just 'English education courses'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'some courses' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'English teaching' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'culture and language competence' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'some courses were related to' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'and others were related to' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'and language competence' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'some of the courses' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'were related to' in the original text.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So your seeking a TESOL masters degree, some courses are related to culture?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少有三堂課與文化和傳播有關係。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the singular verb 'is' instead of the plural verb 'were' to agree with the plural noun 'courses'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
Then, what kind of an assignment would you have to finish for the courses in culture and communication?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'finish' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
每個學生會收到的作業可能都不同。舉我自己的例子來說吧，我人在台灣，然後想要找一份英語教學的工作。為了達成這個目標，然後展現我的能力，我必須表現出我對中文的瞭解。所以我的作業很多都是和中英翻譯有關係。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '每個學生收到的作業可能都不同。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'assignments' as '作業' is incorrect. '作業' refers to homework or assignments given by teachers, while 'assignments' in this context refers to tasks or projects given to students.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'culture and communication courses' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'English teacher' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'prove my competence' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'reach this goal' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'good command of Chinese' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'show that I have' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'Taiwan' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'try to seek a teaching position' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'take myself for example' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'and prove my competence' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'To reach this goal' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'and prove my competence' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'have to show that I have' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'good command of Chinese' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation' in the original text.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
What you mean is that because you are seeking a job to teach English in Taiwan, the homework requires you to have Chinese competence as well? So you have to finish certain assignments in your course, and they are often related to Chinese-English translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of homework being related to Chinese-English translation.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，當然我還被要求要有口說還有寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
OK, let’s go back to what we mentioned before, you said this was your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'you said this was your assignment, right?'

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得那句話。當我拿到中文句子時，我不知道英文剛怎麼說。你知道的，有很多中文的句子對外國人來說很難理解。我需要一些幫助，所以我同事來幫我。我請她幫我翻譯那個句子，再把答案寄給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. 'Chinese words' should be 'Chinese word' to match the singular verb 'can be'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'recognize' as '理解' (understand) is incorrect. The correct translation should be '辨认' (recognize).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the important detail that the user asked their colleague to help them translate the sentence.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So the situation was… you gave the Chinese sentence to your colleague and she sent back the English translation of it? So this text message was only an answer for an assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
那封簡訊就只是作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'message' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
OK, then, let’s take a look at Evidence number 1, page 14 to 16. Please take a look at the content. Are the reason behind sending all these text messages, your homework assignment?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '偵卷' as 'homework assignment' instead of 'evidence'.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，所有的簡訊都是要幫助我回答我作業的問題。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the purpose of the messages. Instead of stating that the messages were for completing assignments, the translation mentions that they were for helping the user answer their homework questions.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then may I ask you, may you explain that your wife is accusing you of having an affair with your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '王彩燕' as 'Tsai-Yen Wang' instead of 'Wang Tsai-Yen'.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了。我知道她對我很不滿意，就在于沒辦法照顧好家庭上。法官我希望你知道，從我開始攻讀碩士到現在她一直沒有支持我。她一點也不想幫助我完成學業。她要是更支持我一點，我才不需要請我同事來幫我。我想這所有的誤解應該怪在她身上才對。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	照顧好家庭上 -> 支持家庭
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	照顧好家庭上 -> supporting the family
omission or addition	omitting important details	never shown any support -> 一直沒有支持我
omission or addition	omitting important details	not willing to help me complete my degree -> 一點也不想幫助我完成學業
omission or addition	omitting important details	If she had been a bit more supportive -> 她要是更支持我一點
omission or addition	omitting important details	I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding -> 我想這所有的誤解應該怪在她身上才對

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, there seems to be an unhappy relationship between the two parties.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們剛結婚的時候，我們的確度過了一些美好的時光。但是我的失業就是一個很大的問題。我嘗試要找到教葡萄牙文的工作，但沒辦法取得很穩定的工作時數，所有工作問題就成為我們兩個人之間的阻礙。我們時常為了這件事情吵架。她不認為我已經盡力了。我也真的沒辦法認清我的狀況與我面臨的問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我嘗試要找到教葡萄牙文的工作' is incorrect. It should be '我嘗試找到教葡萄牙文的工作'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb '取得' should agree with the subject '我', so it should be '取得了' instead of '取得'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '工作問題就成為我們兩個人之間的阻礙' is translated as 'the problem between the two of us', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'the job became the issue between the two of us'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我也真的沒辦法認清我的狀況與我面臨的問題' is translated as 'I really can't recognize my situation and the problems I face', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok, then, let’s return to the Masters degree you mentioned. When did your courses begin? Did you finish all your courses? Did you obtain your degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did your courses begin?' instead of 'When did your courses begin?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'finish' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'Did you finish all your courses?' instead of 'Did you finish all your courses?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'obtain' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'Did you obtain your degree?' instead of 'Did you obtain your degree?'

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年的春天開始上課。它是一個兩年的課程。我本來能在2012年十二月完成學位的。但我最後沒有取得學位，因為當時有堅持的工作然後不夠時間去完成作業。就像我先前提到的，我老婆並不太支持我。我覺得我是孤單一個人地在爭取這個學位。我開始感到累，然後煩惱。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我本來能在2012年十二月完成學位的'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '因為當時有堅持的工作然後不夠時間去完成作業'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Misinterpretation of the phrase 'my wife has never been very supportive' as '我老婆並不太支持我'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So you mean this…degree requires two years, two terms. But you didn’t finish your degree, why?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒辦法去達到所有的課程的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'finish' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
And when did your last term that you were registered in school end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一學期是2012年的秋天。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'last' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If what you say is true, then your final term ends at September 12th 2012. And by then all your homework assignments have ended. But you continued to sent text message after the end of your course for over 6 months, how do you explain this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the date of the end of the term.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the correct date of the end of the term.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the reason for the continued text message contact with colleagues after the end of the course.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我雖然沒有拿到學位、沒有完成這些課程，但這並不代表我不想繼續讓我英文進步啊！雖然我沒有完成我的課程，但我想不斷讓我的語言能力進步，所以我繼續努力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我雖然沒有完成我的課程'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. The correct verb form should be '讓我的英文進步' instead of '讓我英文進步'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of Chinese language in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So what you mean is that although you didn’t finish your masters courses, you wanted to improve your Mandarin on your own, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，這就是為什麼我找我同事幫我。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
Then the role your colleague takes is kind of like your tutor, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不單只是我的家教，也是我真心的好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我有主動提出要給她錢，但她拒絕我了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有主動提出要給她錢，但她拒絕了我。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, then why did she reply your text messages late at night when she supposedly should be asleep? Doesn’t this exceed what colleagues do to help each other?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說她是一個很支持人的朋友。她犧牲她自己的時間來幫我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是一個很支持人的朋友，所以我才說。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '支持人' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'supportive friend'. The correct word choice should be '支持性的朋友'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the detail that the friend was helping the user learn Chinese. The correct translation should include '幫我學中文'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still teaching English at that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'cram' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是，我還在那邊工作。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is your coworker Tsai-Yen Wang still working there?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也正在那邊工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是搭擋了' instead of '但已經不是搭擋了我們'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, are there any witnesses you wish to subpoena or evidences you wish to show?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I wish to subpoena the defendant’s coworker Tsai-Yen wang from the cram school. I would like her to explain the relationship she has between her and the defendant, and her reason for sending the text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I wish to subpoena Tsai-Yen Wang, the defendant's coworker from the cram school.'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There is a missing comma after 'cram school.' The correct sentence should be 'I wish to subpoena the defendant’s coworker, Tsai-Yen Wang, from the cram school.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user's intention to have Tsai-Yen Wang testify in court as a witness.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, are there any evidence that you wish for the court to investigate?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'are' instead of 'is' in the question.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard the cram school has taken some actions in response to the relationship between those two people. Somebody has tried to ask Tsai-Yen Wang to leave her position. I wonder if the cram school can… if there are any evidence to show this fact?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女王彩燕' as 'Tsai-Yen Wang' instead of 'Queen Cai Yan'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'ask' before the subject 'somebody', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the actions were taken by the cram school.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the actions were taken to persuade Queen Cai Yan to leave her position.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user is asking if there is any evidence to support the fact.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Now, the defendant, are there any evidence you wish for the court to help you investigate? The current situation is your degree courses have ended on December 5th 2012. Homework assignments is no excuse for the texting between you and Tsai-Yen Wang. Especially when your text messages are mainly sent after 9 PM at night. This arises suspicion. Do you have any evidence that may help you with your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'The current situation is your degree courses have ended on December 5th 2012.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束' as 'your degree courses have ended on December 5th 2012.' The meaning of '碩士學位' is 'master's degree' not 'degree courses'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證' which means 'are there any evidence you wish for the court to help you investigate?'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到任何證據可以請法院幫我調查的。就像我之前提到的，我和我同事往來的原因其實很簡單：我只想讓我的中文進步，然後不斷地練習中文而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of wanting to improve their language ability and continue learning Chinese.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next…witness… the next court for the case will be on June 9th 2014, 4:30PM. The plaintiff and the defendant are required to come to court in person. If it is necessary, you can all appoint lawyers, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today, we’re here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. Yu-Hua Chen filed this case. The main reason is that her husband, John Anderson sent intimate messages to his colleague working at the cram school. The person who filed this case checked the messages of her husband and found some intimate messages. Moreover, the defendant would make up some reasons, umm..for example, to have extra working hours in order to teleconference with his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang. The intimate messages the plaintiff has found out were beyond coworker’s relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff decided to file this case. Defendant, you have violated the adultery, what is your plea?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, our main goal is to ask for the details of the intimate messages sent between the defendant and his colleague, so that we can confirm whether the defendant and his colleague do constitute adultery. Do both parties understand our procedure?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the procedure, which is to determine if the defendant and his colleague are involved in an extramarital affair.

我明白

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, plaintiff, how long have you been married to your husband? Do you two have any children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband, plaintiff?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We’ve been married for four years, and we do not have any children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Were you married in Taiwan or in a foreign country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan in order to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Then for the past few years, has his work always been teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, and after we got married, he was still teaching Portuguese. However, among Taiwanese, Portuguese is not a very prevalent and famous language. Therefore, his teaching hours are not too many. Sometimes, he even had a period between a month or two between jobs. Afterwards, in order to have a more stable income, he decided to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English; therefore, he decided to learn English and seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Sometimes, he even had a period between a month or two between jobs' is incorrect. It should be 'Sometimes, he even had a period between jobs for a month or two'.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
What you mean by “seeking an advanced degree” is that he planned to pursue a higher degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the meaning of 'seeking an advanced degree' as 'planned to pursue a higher degree in Taiwan'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
 No. He hopes to teach English in Taiwan; therefore, he needs to receive a degree which is related to English TESOL, and he found a distance learning program which is launched in California. Through this distance learning program, he’s able to learn online without flying to America. Therefore, after receiving the credits, he will be able to receive a master’s degree. His plan was that through getting this master’s degree, he will be able to teach English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'No. He hopes to teach English in Taiwan.' It should be 'No, he hopes to teach English in Taiwan.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '取得的學位是關於英語教學的' as 'he needs to receive a degree which is related to English TESOL'. The correct translation is 'the degree he needs to obtain is related to English teaching'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the distance learning program is offered by a university in California.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the distance learning program allows him to complete the requirements through correspondence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the completion of all the credits is required to obtain the master's degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that his goal is to find a job as an English teacher in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then I would like to ask what is the true relationship between his and the person who he had an affair with?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'true' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
Well, they are colleagues at the cram school. At the cram school, the woman was partnered with my husband, and the woman was a Chinese teacher, and my husband an English teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '中師' as 'Chinese teacher' instead of 'middle school teacher'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the woman was the user's husband's partner.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the cram school also had an English teacher.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
Then how can you proof that they did have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
Well, at the beginning, I just noticed my husband often worked for longer hours at the cram school. And I asked him many times about how come? It was just a cram school! There’s no need, no way to have longer working hours. He told me that he needed to discuss about teaching matters and communicate with his Chinese partner. Therefore, at the beginning, I didn’t doubt him at all. But afterwards, I’ve found out that he will often receive calls after work. The strange this was, when he was answering these calls, he would just go back to his study room and answer the calls instead of answering them in front of me. Therefore, this made me very skeptical of him, and I checked his mobile phone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband's work at the cram school is in the evening after coming home.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'worked' instead of 'works' to describe the husband's current situation at the cram school.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user did not provide the critical context that the wife checked her husband's phone because she became suspicious of his behavior.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Then did you find anything wrong or anything strange?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'wrong' in their translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
Well, I’ve found out that one number appeared very, very often in his cell phone record. Therefore, I was so curious that I checked his instant messages. Then, I found out that he sent messages with a woman nearly every day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'cell phone record' instead of 'communication record'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '查簡訊' as 'checked instant messages' instead of 'checked text messages'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is a male ('他的通訊紀錄' -> 'his communication record').

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
It’s just merely messages. How about the content? Are they unusual or intimate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they were just normal messages, then I’m okay with that. However, he is married to me, how can he allow that woman to send him such intimate messages? I provided some content of the messages to the court earlier. I believe they’re in the folder.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '已婚的人' as 'married to me' instead of 'a married person'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court and the belief that they are in a folder.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Let’s look at evidence one, page thirteen. Defendant, please take a look at some of the messages here. Were these messages the same with the messages in your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的。一模一樣。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
 Then I would ask you some questions according to these messages. The first message appears to be sent by someone, whose number was 0958932, at 9 pm, November 31, 2012, and the content was, I really miss you, my love.” What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misinterpreted the date and time in the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
喔，那是我同事發給我的啊。我記得我那時候請假，請了兩天。她那時很擔心我吧。那就是為甚麼她會發那一封訊息給我。而且她是在美國長大、受教育的，所以她是一個非常開放的女生。那就是她講話的方式和表達的方式啊。至於「我的愛」，只是互相叫對方會用的辭啊，並沒有代表甚麼意思。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'my love' as a term of endearment
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in sentence structure
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	misinterpretation of 'my love' as a term of endearment

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Okay, so do you mean that the person who sent this message to you was westernized because she was educated in the US? Therefore, she was very open with her feelings, and the word “my love” doesn’t mean anything, is that right?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對啊，當然沒有意思啊， 因為那只是親密的朋友或好朋友之間的稱呼而以。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the idiomatic expression 'friends who care a lot for each other' to the target language.

那她前面那句呢？
Then how about the previous sentence that she sent?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
我剛剛已經提到了，她那時候非常擔心我，而且我們是工作夥伴! 我兩天沒去工做啊，她當然會想我啊!
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Okay, what you mean is, because you haven’t been to work for two days; therefore you colleague missed you and was worried about you? Moreover, without your assistance, she missed you? Was that merely the reason?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，內容就是這樣子，所以我的那一封訊息根本不算甚麼啊!
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. Instead of saying 'no big deal', the user's translation says 'my message is nothing at all', which changes the meaning.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Okay, let’s look at the second message, sent by the same person at 11:55 pm, January 13, 2013. The content was, “I want you by my side, when will we be together?” So what did this sentence mean? Why did this person want to send you this sort of content?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'truly' as 'will'.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
因為她要教我如何用中文表達這一種內容。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Oh, so you mean she sent you this message in order to teach you, assist you, explain to you how to translate sentences? What does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太跟庭上說的，我正在攻讀碩士學位。要順利拿到學位，我必須拿到30學分。當然是要做一些作業、一些練習啊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Please explain clearly to me, what were you studying for concerning your master’s program?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
就是英語教學的碩士學位啊。在學位裡面，還有分英語教學的課程、文化的課程、和交流的課程。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'TESOL' is translated as '英語教學的碩士學位' which means 'master's degree in English teaching' instead of 'TESOL'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'culture and language competence' is translated as '文化的課程、和交流的課程' which means 'courses on culture and communication' instead of 'culture and language competence'.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you mean that this master’s degree was mainly about English teaching; however, you are also studying about culture interaction, right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對，至少有三門課是跟文化交流、溝通相關的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what sort of assignment will be assigned in these courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'sort' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
每個人所被分配到的作業不一樣。因為我现在在台灣，希望找到一份英語教學的工作。因此，為了達成這個目標，我必須能證明我有足夠的中文能力。因此我有很多作業都是有關中英字句的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為我現在在台灣' instead of '因為我在台灣現在'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments are for culture and communication courses.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments are different for every student.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the assignments are about Chinese-English sentence translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean that because you planned to teach English in Taiwan; therefore, this master’s degree will be able to proof that you have enough Chinese language competence? Therefore, you have the finish the assignments being assigned in these courses, and the assignments include Chinese and English sentence translation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'to' in 'have to'

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對沒錯，而且我有必須加強我口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '而且我必須加強我口說和寫作能力。'

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, then let’s start again. You said that this was your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得。當我拿到那一份作業的時候，我不知道它是甚麼意思。而且你知道，對有些外國人來說，有些中文字句非常難懂。因此，我非常需要幫助，所以我就問了我的同事啊。我請她幫我翻那一句話，然後透過簡訊傳給我答案。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not adapt the idiomatic expressions from Chinese to English.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Okay, so what you mean was that at that time, you first sent the Chinese version of that sentence, and she helped you translate it and sent you that sentence in English? Is that right? And that means this message was just the answer to your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
沒錯，只是作業的答案。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
 Okay, then let’s take a look at evidence one, page 14 to 16, and let’s take a look at all the content of all the messages. Please, just take a look at these contents. And the main reason was, because you want to finish your assignment, and you asked your colleague to translate them for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking help from the colleague in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'translate' before the subject 'colleague' in the sentence.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，所有的訊息都是因為我要完成我的作業，拿到答案，所以才會有這些訊息。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes a cultural transformation by adding the intention of obtaining answers to complete assignments, which is not present in the original text.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then how about your wife filing the adultery case against you and your colleague Ms. Tsai-Yen Wang?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the original text, changing the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'filing' instead of 'filed' to match the past tense of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '一事' which means 'one matter' in the original text.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user did not accurately translate the names, '王彩燕' and 'Tsai-Yen Wang', which are culturally specific references.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太對於這事真的想太多了。我知道她對於我提供家庭一些資金啊不是很滿意。在此，我想告訴庭上，我在攻讀碩士學位期間，我太太從來沒有關心我。而且她也沒有協助我完成我的碩士學位。如果她願意支持我、幫助我的話，那我也不會請我的同事幫我啊。所以我覺得她才是要被責怪的對象。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'supporting the family' as 'providing some money for the family'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the wife's lack of support during the husband's study.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '在此' (here) which is not present in the original text.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your saying, it seems that between you and your wife, the relationship is not very good.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
結婚後的一段時間，我們相處確實很好啦。但是最大的問題在於我有沒有工作。我在台灣試著教葡萄牙語，但是我的時數很少。因此這個問題就成了我們兩人之間的一到牆。我們為這件事就一直吵架，吵了好多次。她不認為我已經盡力了。她也不了解我面臨這種窘境的時候，感到多受挫、多憤怒。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我們相處確實很好啦' (We did have some good time)

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, then let’s go back to the master’s degree that we’ve just mentioned. When did you start that master’s program? Did you receive a master’s degree? Has it ended?

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在春季2011年入學的。我需要攻讀兩年。我應該是要在103年的12月就要完成這個學位。但是因為那時我兼職，導致我無法準時完成我的學位，因為沒時間寫作業。如同我剛剛所提的，我太太一點都沒支持我。結果我那時就覺得非常的無助啊，好像是我自己孤拎拎的要拿到那個學位。因此我感到非常的勞累、受挫。

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
Okay, so you said that this master’s degree requires a two-year study; however, you didn’t received that degree on time, why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '完成' as 'received' instead of 'completed'

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
因為我無法如期完成課程所需的作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '如期' (as scheduled) before the verb '完成' (finish), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
Then when was the last date you registered for the program?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
是在103年的秋季班註冊。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
According to your statement, the semester that you finished the course would be December 5, 2012, and after your complete that semester, you won’t have any assignment, right? However, the colleague kept sending your messages six months after your study, why was that
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the original text

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我那時候是還沒有拿到碩士學位，但是那又並不代表我不想增進我的語言能力。縱使我沒有拿到那個學位，我依然想要我的中文能力進步啊，自己字學啊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我那時候還沒有拿到碩士學位'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但是那並不代表我不想增進我的語言能力'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '縱使我沒有拿到那個學位'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我依然想要提高我的中文能力'.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that even if you didn’t successfully get that master’s degree, you still hope to improve you Chinese ability, is that so?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對啊，而且那就是為什麼我會尋求我的同事幫助。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the role that your colleague was playing equals to your mentor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'mentor' instead of 'tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，還是我真正的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Then, did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'Then, did you pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有喔，沒有付錢給她。我有提過要付給她，但是她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有提過要付給她，但是她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t even pay her, then why would she be willing to send you messages in the middle of the night, when she could just sleep? Don’t you think that this was just beyond coworker’s relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '不辭辛勞' as 'willing' instead of 'unwilling'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'in the middle of the night' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'send'.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
我才會說她是一個非常好的朋友啊。她願意占用她自己的時間，幫助我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是一個非常好的朋友' (She is a very good friend).
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the detail that the friend was helping the user learn Chinese. The correct translation should include '幫助我學習中文' (help me learn Chinese).

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still teaching at that same cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'same' in the translation.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還是在那裏工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
So, is your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang still working at that cram school, too?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
對，她還在那裏工作，但我們已經不是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是搭檔了' instead of '但已經不是搭檔了我們'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Does the prosecutor need to subpoena or have other witnesses?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena the defendant’s coworker Tsai-Yen Wang who works at Po-Yuan cram school, and come here as witness. I would ask her to clearly state the background and goal of the messages she sent to the defendant.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of subpoenaing the defendant's coworker and the specific relationship between the defendant and the coworker.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'subpoena' instead of 'subpoenaing'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' after the object 'the defendant's coworker' instead of before it.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plaintiff, do you wish the court to investigate on any evidence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I’ve heard that the cram school has already taken some action against the relationship between them. About their action, they have persuaded Tsai-Yen Wang to quit her job. I would like to ask whether it is possible to verify this issue.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '試圖說服' as 'persuaded' instead of 'attempted to persuade'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'persuaded' before the subject 'they', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the action was taken by the cram school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Now, currently, the situation is that you finished your master’s degree on December 5, 2012, Therefore, making an excuse of doing an assignment with Tsai-Yen Wang is not really reasonable. Especially, the interaction between you two often appears after 9 pm. That makes one very, very skeptical. Do you have any evidence which may help you with your case? Now, let me ask the defendant, what would you like the court to investigate on the case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Therefore, making an excuse of doing an assignment with Tsai-Yen Wang is not really reasonable' is incorrect. It should be 'Therefore, it is not really reasonable to make an excuse of doing an assignment with Tsai-Yen Wang.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'That makes one very, very skeptical' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'That raises suspicions.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the question 'Do you have any evidence which may help you with your case?'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
沒有，我並沒有證據要庭上代表我去偵查。之前已經提過了，我和同事之間的交流、互動是非常簡單的。只是想要增進我的語文能力，繼續學中文啊。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'evidence' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '庭上代表我去偵查' in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'improve my language ability' as '增進我的語文能力' instead of '提高我的語言能力'.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The court will set the time to ask the witness to come to the court at 4:30 pm, June 9, 2012. The plaintiff and the defendant need to come to the court. And if it’s necessary, each party can ask for a lawyer.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'The court will set the time to ask the witness to come to the court at 4:30 pm, June 9, 2012.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the 'witness' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the 'if necessary' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'both parties' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'lawyer' in the original text.

我明白。

It should be 'If you come from a low-income family, a medium-and-low-income family, or if you are an aborigine or meet other qualifications set by the law, you have the right to a lawyer and may ask the court for legal assistance.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The translation omits the mention of the right to a lawyer in the original text.

被告是否了解以上權利？
Do you fully understand your rights?

I understand.
是，我了解。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The plaintiff, Yu-Hua, Chen, filed this case. The reason for the plaintiff to file this case is that her husband, John Anderston, is beyond co-workers’ relationship with a person. The plaintiff found some intimate messages and records in the defendant’s cell phone. Furthermore, the defendant, John Anderston, found reasons for working late in the cram school and conducted tele-conferencing with Chai-yan Wang. The contents collected by the plaintiff were beyond co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, your wife is wondering whether you have an affair with others, so she accused you.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The plaintiff, Yu-Hua, Chen, filed this case' is incorrect. It should be 'The plaintiff, Yu-Hua Chen, filed this case.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence 'The reason for the plaintiff to file this case is that her husband, John Anderston, is beyond co-workers’ relationship with a person.' It should be 'The reason for the plaintiff filing this case is that her husband, John Anderston, is involved in an inappropriate relationship with a co-worker.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'beyond co-workers’ relationship with a person' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'involved in an inappropriate relationship with a co-worker.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The plaintiff found some intimate messages and records in the defendant’s cell phone' is incorrect. It should be 'The plaintiff found some intimate messages and records on the defendant’s cell phone.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Furthermore, the defendant, John Anderston, found reasons for working late in the cram school and conducted tele-conferencing with Chai-yan Wang' is incorrect. It should be 'Furthermore, the defendant, John Anderston, found reasons for working late in the cram school and conducting tele-conferencing with Chai-yan Wang.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'The contents collected by the plaintiff were beyond co-workers’ relationship' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'The evidence collected by the plaintiff goes beyond a normal co-worker relationship.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case' is incorrect. It should be 'Therefore, the plaintiff has filed this case.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'The defendant, your wife is wondering whether you have an affair with others, so she accused you' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. It should be 'The defendant, your wife suspects you of having an affair and is accusing you.'

Not guilty, of course.
我當然無罪。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'Of course, I am not guilty.'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the court will focus on the details of these tele-conferencings and intimate messages. The purpose of this procedure is to see whether the interactions between John Anderston and Chai-yan Wang constitute the adultery. Did both parties understand this procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '詢問' as 'focus on' instead of 'ask' or 'inquire'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'these tele-conferencings and intimate messages' before 'the court' instead of after.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant and their colleague having an affair, which is a crucial detail in the original text.

我明白
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
我也明白。

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plaintiff. How long have you got married with the defendant? Did you have a child?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you' instead of 'have you got'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the plaintiff being the one asking the question.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years, and we don’t have any child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'we don't have any children' instead of 'we don't have any child'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I met him in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user's husband ('my husband').
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the user's husband came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past years, his job in Taiwan is to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should be 'was' to match the past tense of the sentence.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we knew each other initially, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan; his teaching hours were not stable. Sometimes, there had been a period between works for months. In order to have stable incomes, he decided to teach English instead. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek a advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'When we knew each other initially' should be 'When we initially knew each other'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'knew each other' should be translated as 'met' instead of 'knew'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband wanted to have stable incomes by teaching English.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband decided to seek an advanced degree to teach English.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband's mother tongue is not English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he wanted to seek a advanced degree. Did he want to get a degree in Taiwan?
minor categories of semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek a advanced degree' instead of 'further studies'.
minor categories of cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterpreted the cultural reference of '進修' and translated it as 'seek a advanced degree' instead of 'further studies'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan. The degree he wanted to get is about English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California in the United Stated on the Internet. This program allowed him to learn by on-learning, so he didn’t have to go abroad. After he finished all the courses of the program, he could get the degree. He planed to get the degree so that he can teach English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'He planed to get the degree so that he can teach English in Taiwan' is incorrect. It should be 'He planned to get the degree so that he can teach English in Taiwan.'

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So, what is the relationship between the person he have an affair with, Chai-yan Wang?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school. The cram school staff arranged one Chinese teacher partnering with a foreign teacher. Chai-yan Wang is the Chinese teacher.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have some extramarital affairs?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'they have' instead of 'they have some'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
Initially, I noticed that he often stayed late in the cram school for working. I had asked him before because it was just a cram school to teach English. How can he work so late? He told me that because his partnered with a Chinese teacher, they had to discuss more in detail. In the beginning, I did not suspect of him. Later, he often got some phone calls after he came home. After getting the calls, he all went to the study room to talk and did not talk before me. This behavior made me suspect, so I checked his cell phone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the speaker is referring to her husband.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'asked' after the object 'him' instead of before it.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '美語補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'English language school'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the speaker checked her husband's phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Is there any doubtful clue in his cell phone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '不尋常的' as 'doubtful', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'unusual'.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his calling record, there is one number showing up very often. So, I checked his text messages with that number. After I checked text messages, I found that he sends messages with a woman every day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is a male.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is in a relationship.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Sending text messages is not a big deal. Is that very inappropriate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If this is a normal text message, that’s all. But he has got married with me, how can he send intimate messages with another woman? I have provided some details about these messages to the court, and these details may be included in the investigatory files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '已婚的人' as 'married with me' instead of 'married person'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court and the inclusion of these details in the investigatory files.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please check page 13 on the investigatory file 1. These are the contents taken from those messages. Please check it. Were these contents from your messages?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是，這是從我的手機簡訊中取下來的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now, the court will ask you some questions in terms of this content. The first is the message sent at 9:50 on November 31st, 2012, and the number is 0958-932XXX. The content is “我非常想念你.” What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我一個同事發給我的。我記得那時候我請兩天假。她非常擔心。這才是為什麼她傳簡訊給我。我同事是在美國受教育的，她的思想十分開放。這就是她說話的方式。至於裡面說的愛，只是我們關懷他人的說法而已。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You said that the woman was educated in the United States, so her concept is more westernized. The expression about her emotion is more open-minded. So, the word “my love” does not have some other implications, does it?
minor categories of cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of the phrase '我的愛' as having no special meaning, when in fact it does.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
這只是好朋友間會講的，沒有什麼特別的意思。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the last sentence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the last sentence in their translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
如前所說，她非常擔心我，我們是工作同事。我兩天沒到，她當然會掛念我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我兩天沒到' instead of '我兩天到沒'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So, you mean that the person sent this message to you because you had two day off at that time? Without your assistance in class, she was very missing you. Is that all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea of the person missing the user due to their absence from work.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對，沒錯，這簡訊不是什麼大問題啊。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'no big deal' is not properly translated.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent at 11:55 p.m. on January 13th, 2013. The message is that “我想要妳陪我，我們什麼時候能在一起呢.” What does this sentence mean? Why is there such a message
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她寫這個句子的原因是，要怎麼把這個句子寫成中文，這是我們作業的內容。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Did you mean that she sent you this message because she wanted to help you complete you assignment? What dose that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太跟庭上所說，我有英語教學的課程。在那個課堂中，我必須要取得30學分，才能擁有學位。當中我會有些作業和活動。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you explain the degree you were perusing?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是英語教學。在那課程中，有英語教學課程，也有文化背景的相關教學。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' instead of '計畫'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'TESOL' is translated as '英語教學' instead of '對外英語教學'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我的課程是英語教學' instead of '我的課程是英語教學'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about some courses being related to culture and language competence.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you are pursuing the degree from the graduate school of TESOL, and in this program, there are some classes related to culture competence. Is that true?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
沒錯，我記的有3個是有關文化溝通的。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'related to culture and communication' as '有關文化溝通的' which means 'related to cultural communication' in English. The user did not accurately convey the meaning of 'culture and communication'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
In this class, what were the assignments given within it?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
在文化溝通這堂課中，每個學生的作業都不同。拿我自身舉例。我想在台灣找個英語教學的職位。為了這個目標，我必須要有能力來證明我的中文能夠變通。所以在作業上，有許多中英翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the courses being different for every student.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the user seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the user needing to prove their competence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the user having to show a good command of Chinese.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the user's assignments being about Chinese-English sentence translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, you mean that you wanted to teach in Taiwan. Therefore, in the courses of the program, you have to proof your Chinese competence. So, you have to finish the assignments arranged by the program so that you can prove your language competence. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of completing assignments as part of the course requirements.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，我也想增進我的聽力還有寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, let us go back to the sentence. This sentence is your assignment. Is it true?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對，我記得這個句子。當我拿到一個英文句子時，我不知怎麼用中文講它。有些句子外國人很難說。我需要些幫忙，所以就找我同事。我問他怎麼翻譯這個句子，她就用簡訊回我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits important details from the original text.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not adapt the idiomatic expressions from Chinese to English.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you mean that you asked the collogue to translate the sentence into Chinese and that she sent back with the English sentence. Is that true? That is to say, the sentence in the text message is that answer of your assignment. Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
這個句子只是我作業的答案而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now, please check page 14-16 on the investigatory file 1.Please check the content. Because you asked for help to complete your assignment, she sent these messages. Is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages on pages 14-16 of the investigatory file 1.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，這些簡訊都是為了要完成作業而傳的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'messages' as '簡訊' which means 'text messages' instead of 'assignments' which means '作業'.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What’s your explanation in terms of your wife’s doubt you have an affair with Chai-yan, Wang?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我老婆想太多了。我知道他對我有固定收入這件事非常不滿意。告訴庭上，我的老婆在課程上並沒給予我任何協助。她根本沒有意願要幫我完成這個學位。如果她多幫我一點，我就不會像我同事求救啊。我覺得她應該為件事被譴責。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	固定收入 (fixed income) should be translated as 支持家庭的能力 (ability to support the family)

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you just said, you two are not very happy with each other.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在婚姻剛開始，我們真的過得很快樂。問題就在我的就業狀況。我想在台灣教葡萄牙語，但授課時數都不是很穩定。我的工作情況變成我們相處的問題。因
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '在婚姻剛開始' should come after the subject '我們'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '過得很快樂' is translated as 'we had a good time', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'we did have some good time'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about fighting between the couple over the employment issue.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the frustration and difficult situation faced by the speaker.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Let’s go back to the program. When did you start participating in the program? Is that finished? Did you get your degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年剛開始時參與的。這是2年的課程。我應該在2012年12月完成的。但我沒辦法在這2年內完成學位，因為現在工作太忙了，沒辦法完成所有的作業。就像我剛說的，我的老婆根本不支持我。我覺得只能靠自己的力量來完成這個學位。我非常勞累、感到挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我在2010年剛開始時參與的'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '我應該在2012年12月完成的'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我沒辦法在這2年內完成學位'.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	Incorrect pronoun usage in the sentence '因為現在工作太忙了'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '沒辦法完成所有的作業'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我的老婆根本不支持我'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我覺得只能靠自己的力量來完成這個學位'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我非常勞累、感到挫折'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You just said that this program is a two-year program, and you had not finished it yet. What’s the reason?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒辦法達成這些課程所有的需求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When was the last registration date? When did it end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一次註冊的時間是2012年的秋天。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'semester' which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '2012年的秋天' at the end of the sentence instead of after the verb '註冊'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
According to what you just said, the program ended on December 5th, 2012. There is some duration between the dates you just said. So, at that time, you don’t have any assignments, right? However, after the program ended, you still got messages from the person for 6 months. Why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of the duration between dates

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然我沒有完成那個課程，但就不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。雖然我沒有完成這個課程，但我還是想要增進我的中文能力，所以我就自學。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of failing the program in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '就不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊' in the wrong position in the sentence.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that although you fell to finish the program, you still want to enhance your Chinese language competence and want to speak fluent Chinese. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對，所以我就請我同事幫忙我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So, this co-worker served as the Chinese tutor for you. Is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教，而是我真正的好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，雖然我有要付她錢，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '雖然我有要付她錢，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
Without your payment, why did still send you messages in the very late time when most people go to bed? Are these interaction beyond co-workers’ relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我說這個朋友非常支持我。她用她自己的時間幫我學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這個朋友非常支持我' instead of '我說這個朋友非常支持我'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Did you still teach English in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'teach' instead of 'teaching' to match the present continuous tense.

Yes, I am still working there.
對，我還在那邊工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does this person still work there as well?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the name of the colleague, which is an important detail.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那家補習班上課，但我們現在沒有跟她搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們現在沒有跟她搭檔了，她也還在那家補習班上課。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, is there any need to subpoena another person in this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena the defendant’s colleague, Chai-yan, Wang, who is working in the Bo-Yuan cram school as the witness in this case. I would like to ask her to explain her relationship with the defendant and to elaborate the purposes of these text messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's colleague's full name, Chai-yan, Wang.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'subpoena' before the object 'the defendant's colleague', resulting in incorrect word order.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'subpoena' as '傳訊', which does not accurately convey the legal meaning of the term.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the request for the colleague to testify in court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the specific content of the text messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The plaintiff, is there any evidence which you hope the court to investigate for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Is there any evidence that you hope the court to investigate for you?'

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that that cram school has taken some actions about the relationship between my husband and that party. One of the actions is that the cram school asked Chai-yan, Wang to quit her job. I want the cram school to proof and make more explanations for that.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女王彩燕' as 'my husband and that party' instead of 'Chai-yan, Wang'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the cram school's attempt to persuade Chai-yan, Wang to quit her job.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
The defendant, is there any evidence that you hope the court to investigate for you? Now, the situation is that your program had ended on December 5th, 2012. There is no reason to explain why you two send messages to each other after you fell the program, especially the time when you sent text messages and interacted with each other, because the time is too late. Do you have any evidence to explain for yourself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'because the time is too late' should be 'because the time is too late at night'.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我手邊沒有任何證據和資料來佐證。就像我說，我們兩個傳簡訊、互動的理由很簡單。我只是想增進我的語文能力，和繼續學中文而已。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我手邊沒有任何證據和資料來佐證。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple' as '我們兩個傳簡訊、互動的理由很簡單' does not accurately convey the meaning. It should be translated as '我和同事之間的溝通原因很簡單'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the purpose of the communication, which is 'I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese'.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
Then, the court will set the next court date at 4:30 p.m. on July 9th, 2014 for the inquiry procedure. The defendant, you have to attend the court. It is necessary that both of you can have a lawyer at that day. Do you understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user mistranslated '庭訂' as 'set the next court date' instead of 'conduct the witness examination procedure'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '證人詰問程序' as 'inquiry procedure' instead of 'witness examination procedure'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the need for both parties to attend the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the possibility for both parties to have a defense lawyer.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the day being the 9th.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the need for both parties to understand.

我明白。
I understand.

I understand.
我明白。

今天庭期到此結束。
Okay, the today’s court will end here.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Today's court' instead of 'the today's court'.

今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序
Today we are here for preparatory procedure of case number 2887, adultery.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'criminal' before 'case number 2887'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '通姦' as 'adultery' instead of 'criminal adultery'.

通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國103年5月27日。」
I am here today for adultery case, Case Number 2887 as an interpreter. I promise to faithfully and honestly translate/interpret what is stated in this court. In the case of deliberately making false interpretation, the violation of perjury will apply.

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
 Today we are here for preparatory procedure of adultery case.The defendant named Yu-Hua Chen filed this case.The main reason is that her husband has an intimate relationship with his co-worker in the cram school.The plantiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. In addition, her husband often has tele-conferencing with his co-worker, Cai-Ian Wang in the midnight, and he often stay up late…..The evidence that the plantiff found has beyond co-worker’s relationship. That is the reason why the plantiff filed this case.Defendant, what’s your plea about your wife charged you of adultery.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'preparatory procedure' instead of 'preliminary procedure'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '告訴人' as 'defendant' instead of 'plaintiff'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's name, John Anderston.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user added 'stay up late' which is not mentioned in the original text.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated '通姦罪' as 'adultery' instead of 'adultery crime'.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the main point is to question the defendant of the message with his co-worker.The purpose is to investigate whether these messages can constitute the adultery.Both parties, do you fully understand the procedure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Both parties, do you fully understand the procedure?'

我明白
 I understand.

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
Plantiff, how long have you married with your husband? Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'married' should be changed to 'been married' to match the present perfect tense.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun 'you' should be changed to 'the plaintiff' to match the original text.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
I have married with my husband for 4 years. We don’t have children.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I have married' instead of 'I have married'.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry with your husband in Taiwan? Or other countries?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
 We met each other in Taiwan, He taught Portuguese in Taiwan 4 years ago.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So he has taught Portuguese in Taiwan in the past years?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'has taught' should agree with the subject 'he', so it should be 'has he taught' instead of 'so he has taught'.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he still taught Portuguese.However, Portuguese is not so popular in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hours is not stable.Sometimes, he did not work for 1 or 2 months. Therefore, in order to have more income, he started to teach English.However, since his mother tongue is not English, he decided to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Sometimes, he did not work for 1 or 2 months.' The correct word order should be 'Sometimes, he did not work for 1 or 2 months.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband wanted to have a more stable income by teaching English.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband decided to seek an advanced degree in order to teach English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You have mentioned he is going to seek an advanced degree, does it mean that he has to study for a degree in Taiwan….
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the person mentioned in the original text is going to study for a degree in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
NO.Because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, he has to get a degree for English teaching.He has found a distance learning program provided from California,Therefore, he can have a distance learning in Taiwan, rather than going to America.After he finished this distance program, he can get a degree.The reason he takes this distance learning program is that he can get a job of English teacher.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is his relationship with the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in cram school.In that cram school, they are partners. One is Chinese teacher, and the other is English teacher. She is the Chinese teacher.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'partners' is not an accurate translation for '搭檔教學'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be 'One is the Chinese teacher, and the other is the English teacher.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the co-workers are in the same class.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know that they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
First, I only realized that my husband often work late in cram school.I have asked him the question that how come you have so many work to do in a English cram school?He told me that he has to partner with a Chinese teacher. They have many things to discuss with.At first, I really didn’t suspect him.However, I have found he usually picked up some phone calls after he got home.When he answered the phone, he would go to the study room instead of talking in front of me.That the reason why I started to suspect him and I checked his cellphone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband works late in the cram school.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'I asked him why he has so much work to do in an English cram school.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband partners with a Chinese teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband receives phone calls after coming home.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband goes to the study room to answer the phone calls.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Do you find any problem in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I often see the same phone number in his phone book.Therefore, I was so curious about it so I checked his text message.Then I found that he texts with a woman almost every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'phone book' instead of 'text message'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of checking the text messages in the translation.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
It is just a message. Is something improper in the message?

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
 If it is just a normal message, it’s okay.However, he is a married person. How can he let other text him with some intimate messages?I have provided some intimate messages for the court. It should be in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '簡訊內容' as 'intimate messages' instead of 'message content'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the messages to the court in the translation.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
As the file one, page.13.Defendant, please see the content of these messages. Are these messages taken from your cellphone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的,這是我手機上的訊息
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'message' is translated as '訊息' which means 'message' in Chinese, so there is no error in this category.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is correct, so there is no error in this category.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not omit any important details, so there is no error in this category.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The translation does not convey any level of formality or politeness, so there is no error in this category.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I am going to ask you some questions about these messages.The message is from the phone number 0958-932***. The date is 9:50 p.m., Nov.31st, 2012.The content is “我真的很想你,親愛的” what is this about?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這是我一個同事傳給我的我記得那時候,我休了兩天假他有點擔心我所以他才會傳這封信我的同事是在美國接受教育的,因此思想很開放這是他表達情感的方式至於”親愛的”,這是對我們所關心的人的一個統稱
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that the person who sent you this message has spent some time in western countries. Therefore, she is more open-minded.She is also open-minded in expressing her emotions?Therefore, the words ”my love” do not have much meaning, right?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿 就只是好朋友間的稱呼
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not capture the idiomatic expression 'friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
How about the last sentence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the last sentence in their translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛說的,我們是同事,他就只是擔心我當我不在兩天,他自然會想我啊
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean that it because that you took two days off, she sent you this message. Without your assistance, she misses you. Is that all?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the person misses the user because they didn't have their assistance in class.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對阿 就這樣啊 這訊息又沒什麼
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase '這訊息又沒什麼' does not capture the idea of 'no big deal' in English.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message is sent at 11:55 p.m. Jan.13th, 2013, and is from the same phone number.The content is that”我希望你在我身邊,什麼時候能成真呢?”Then what does this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他寫這封信只是想告訴我怎麼寫作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean that she sent you this message to help you do your homework? How?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太說的,我有參加遠距教學課程我需要修習30學分,才能得到學位所以我當然需要完成一些作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我有參加遠距教學課程，就像我太太說的。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about attending a Master's program and the requirement of completing 30 credits before receiving the degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about needing to complete assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Please explain that what did you learn from this program?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是關於英語教學 課程內容有分幾個部分, 有英語教學,文化及語言能力等等
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you get a degree in TESOL, but there are some courses about culture communication, right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對阿 我記得至少有三堂課是關於文化溝通
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What is the assignment from the culture and communication course?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'assignment' in their translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
針對每個不同的學生,會有不同的作業就我而言我在台灣,並且想得到一份英語教學的工作為了達到這個目標,我必須證明我有足夠的中文能力因此,我有很多關於英中句子翻譯的作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove that you have certain language competence in Chinese, right?So you have to finish some assignments in this course, and they are English-to-Chinese translation of sentences? Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是阿 就是這樣啊 我另外也需要加強我的口說和寫作技巧
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, let’s go back to the last sentence. You said that it’s your assignment?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'is' should agree with the subject 'it', so it should be 'it is' instead of 'it’s'.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對阿 我還記得這句子當我拿到這個中文句子時,我不知道怎麼翻譯你也知道吧, 有些中文字對外國人來說很難記得我需要一些幫助阿 所以我找我同事我請他幫我翻譯,然後再傳給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun 'her' should be 'him' to match the gender of the colleague.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the specific sentence that was translated.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds unnecessary information about the difficulty of Chinese words for foreigners.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Your co-worker translated this sentence into English and sent to you, right?That is to say, the content of this message is just the answer of my homework.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about asking the co-worker in Chinese and receiving the answer in English.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
是的 就只是我作業的解答
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the message being an answer to the homework.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now please see the file one, page.14-16.Please see these contents.  Are these messages all about your assignment?

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對的 所有簡訊都是關於作業上的問題
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'messages' was translated as '簡訊' which means 'text messages' instead of 'assignments'.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
What is your explanation about your wife charged you of having an affair with Cai-Ian Wang?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '針對' as 'charged' instead of 'said' or 'accused'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'charged' instead of 'charges' to match the subject-verb agreement.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the user's explanation in the translation.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了我知道他對我對於這個家的付出感到不滿我希望庭上知道,打從一開始,他就不支持我修這課程他不願意幫助我完成這份課程如果他願意幫我的話,我就不用問我同事拉 因此 我認為他要為這些誤會負責
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of pronouns
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of critical context

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, there seems to be some disagreements between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '相處不愉快' as 'disagreements' instead of 'unpleasant interactions'.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在剛結婚的時候,我們的確相處得不錯  但問題就出在我的工作我試著在台灣教葡萄牙文,但卻沒有穩定的工作時數因此我的工作成了我們之間的大問題我們常為了這件事爭吵他不相信我真的已經盡力了我不知道要怎樣讓他了解我的困難和挫折
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '在剛結婚的時候,我們的確相處得不錯' (At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time). The correct word order should be '我們在剛結婚的時候的確相處得不錯' (We did have some good time at the beginning of our marriage).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the employment issue being the problem between the couple. The correct translation should include the phrase '但問題就出在我的工作' (But the problem is my employment).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the couple fighting over the employment issue. The correct translation should include the phrase '我們常為了這件事爭吵' (We fought from time to time over this issue).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the speaker's frustration and difficult situation. The correct translation should include the phrase '我不知道要怎樣讓他了解我的困難和挫折' (I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced).

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, let’s talk about the aforementioned courses.When did it start? Did you get your degree?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question about when the master's program ended.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question about whether the user obtained a degree.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
 我的課程是在2010年春天開始 這是兩年的課程我應該是要在2012年12月完成我並沒有完成這課程,因為我在做兼職的工作,沒有足夠的時間完成作業就像我說的,我太太並不支持我做這件事我覺得我只有一個人在努力得到這學位我覺得很累而且很挫折
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我應該是要在2012年12月完成我並沒有完成這課程'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '我太太並不支持我做這件事'
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: '我覺得我只有一個人在努力得到這學位'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program: '因為我在做兼職的工作,沒有足夠的時間完成作業'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	Addition of unnecessary information: '我覺得很累而且很挫折'

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
This is a two-year program. Why did you fail to finish it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我沒辦法達到所有課程的要求
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'finish' which is an important detail in the original text.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When did your last semester end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
最後一學期是2012年秋天
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'registration' from the translation.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
According to what you said, after Dec.5, 2012. You have no more assignments after then, right?Then how come you still contact with your co-worker…….
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the six-month period of continued contact with colleagues.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我雖然沒辦法完成課程,但這並不代表我不想增進我的語言能力 即使我拿不到學位,我還是很努力地想靠自己增進我的中文能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '即使我拿不到學位，我還是很努力地想靠自己增進我的中文能力。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So even if you failed the program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對 這就是為什麼我尋求同事的幫助
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So this co-worker just plays a role like your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '扮演的角色' as 'plays a role' instead of 'plays the role'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不只是我的家教,更是我的好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不只是我的家教, 更是我的好朋友'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Do you pay her?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'pay' should be in the past tense to agree with the past tense of 'have'.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
我想付他錢,但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想付她錢,但她拒絕了'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
Why she answered you in the midnight even if you didn’t pay her?Is this behavior beyond co-worker’s relationship?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
所以我才說他是個很支持我的朋友阿他不惜犧牲自己的時間幫助我學中文
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'she' as '他' (he) instead of '她' (she).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the particle '阿' at the end of the sentence instead of after '朋友' to indicate familiarity.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of learning Chinese in the translation.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still wok in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you still work in that cram school?'

Yes, I am still working there.
對阿 我還在那教英文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is Cai-Ian Wang still working there, too?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The subject and verb are in the wrong order.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
他還在那工作啊,只是我們不是搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '只是我們不是搭檔了, 他還在那工作啊'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you want to subpoena any witness or to investigate any other evidence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
 I hope to subpoena Cai-Ian Wang who works in Bo-Yuan cram school as a witness. I want her to explain the relationship between her and the defendant. Also, the details of the messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the user's intention to contact the defendant's colleague and the purpose of the messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the sentence 'I hope to subpoena Cai-Ian Wang who works in Bo-Yuan cram school as a witness.' The correct word order should be 'I hope to subpoena Cai-Ian Wang as a witness, who works in Bo-Yuan cram school.'

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Plantiff, do you have any other evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'want' instead of 'wants' to match the singular subject 'plaintiff'.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has taken some actions about their relationship.Among that, I heard that the cram school has persuaded Cai-Ian Wang to quit the job. I wonder whether I can ask the cram school for this.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女王彩燕' as 'Cai-Ian Wang' instead of 'Queen Cai-Yan'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'persuaded' before the subject 'the cram school', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the actions taken by the cram school, only mentioning the persuasion of Queen Cai-Yan.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you?The situation is that your program has finished on Dec.5th, 2012.You have no reason to text message with Cai-Ian Wang Especially that you two also text message to each other after 9:00 p.m.Do you have any evidence to help you with this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Especially that you two also text message to each other after 9:00 p.m.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation 'your program has finished on Dec.5th, 2012' does not accurately convey the meaning of 'your master's degree has already ended on December 5th, 2012'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我想不到任何可以請庭上為我調查的證據就像我說的,我們之間傳簡訊的原因是很單純的我真的只是想要增強我的語言能力並學中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court for questioning of witness is set at 4:30 p.m. June 9th, 2014.Plantiff and Defendant, you have to show up. If necessary, both parties have right to a lawyer.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'The next court for questioning of witness is set at 4:30 p.m. June 9th, 2014.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the specific procedure, which is '證人詰問程序' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the instruction for both parties to attend the court, which is '被告都要到庭' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the possibility for both parties to have a lawyer, which is '如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人' in the original text.

我明白。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of adultery. The plaintiff Yu Hua Chen file this case. It is because his husband has something with his co-worker. The plaintiff has found some intimate messages in his cell phone. In addition, the plaintiff’s husband will find reasons for working late or tele-conferences with his co-worker Cai Yan Wang. The messages that the plaintiff has collected has been beyond the co-workers’ relationship. As a result, she files this case. The defendant, your wife suspects you of adultery, what’s your pleat?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in sentence: 'The plaintiff Yu Hua Chen file this case.' It should be 'The plaintiff Yu Hua Chen files this case.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Misinterpretation of 'his husband has something with his co-worker.' It should be 'her husband has a relationship with his co-worker.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for the plaintiff's suspicion of adultery: 'The plaintiff suspects her husband of adultery.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the defendant's response to the accusation: 'The defendant pleads not guilty.'

Not guilty, of course.
我無罪答辯
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '答辯無罪' instead of '我無罪答辯'.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the purpose is to ask the messages between the defendant and his co-worker. The purpose is to prove if the defendant commits the crime of adultery with his co-worker. Do you understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節' as 'ask the messages between the defendant and his co-worker' instead of 'ask about the communication details between the defendant and his co-worker'.

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The plaintiff, how many years have you been married with your husband? Do you have any child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How many years have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'has you been married'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question does not include the information about having children, which was mentioned in the original text.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years and we do not have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Are you married in Taiwan or broad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I meet with my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'I met my husband in Taiwan.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they got married to their husband.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
In the past years, did he also teach Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued to teach Portuguese. However, because the Portuguese is not so common language that people learn in Taiwan, so his teaching hours are not so fixed. Sometimes the period between jobs will be two months. Then he hoped he can get the fixed income, so he started to teach English. However, because his mother language is not English, he decided to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Sometimes the period between jobs will be two months.' The correct word order should be 'Sometimes the period between jobs will be two months.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband wanted to seek an advanced degree in English.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree, is he want to get a degree in Taiwan?
minor categories of semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advanced degree' instead of 'further studies'. This is an inappropriate cultural transformation as '進修' does not necessarily imply pursuing a degree.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he hoped to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he achieved has to be English teaching. He found a distant learning program which is provided by the California in America on the Internet. He can complete his courses with the distant learning without going to the America. In this way, he can achieve the doctor degree. He planned to achieve American degree to find the English teaching job in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'He can complete his courses with the distant learning without going to the America.' The correct word order should be 'He can complete his courses with distant learning without going to America.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the protagonist wants to achieve a master's degree, not a doctorate degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the protagonist wants to achieve a master's degree in English teaching.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the distant learning program is offered by a university in California.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the protagonist wants to find an English teaching job in Taiwan after obtaining the degree.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what is his relationship between the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are co-workers in the cram school. In that cram school, they have arranged the teachers to partner with each other. And the person is his partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know they have adultery?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'adultery' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So what did you see in his cell phone that is innormal

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In his phone call history, there is a fixed number. So I was curious that I checked his messages. After checking, he has sent a message to a woman almost every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '查' as 'checked' instead of 'looked up'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is sending messages to the woman.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Is there any wrong to send message? Is it because the message is not so appropriate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If the message is so ordinary, then it will be fine. But he was a person who got married, how can he send the intimate messages? I provided the message contents to the court. I think they are all in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated the phrase '如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了' as 'If the message is so ordinary, then it will be fine.' The correct translation is 'If it was just a normal text message, then it would be fine.' The user's translation does not accurately convey the conditional aspect of the original sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the sender of the messages is a married person. This detail is important for understanding the context and the user's concern about the content of the messages.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please check the page 13 on the file 1. The defendant, there are some message contents, please check this. Are these messages the contents in your cell phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
沒錯
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Now I want to ask you some questions according to these contents. The first message is sent in the number of 0958932… at 9:50 pm November 31st 2012. The content is “I really miss you, my love” What’s the meaning?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of date format

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
嗯…那是我同是寄的啊！我記得那時候我請了2天的假。她感到有點擔心。這就是為甚麼她寄給我這種簡訊。我同事在美國讀過書，所以她非常的開放。那就是她說話的方式啊！為甚麼她說”love”這個字呢? 這就是我們稱呼彼此的方法啊！
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misunderstanding cultural context and using inappropriate language

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You mean that the message sender because he once studied in America so she is open minded? And she is also open minded in emotion expression, so the word “my love” do not have any special meaning?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
沒有啊，在朋友之間這是非常平常的表達方法
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the sentence she mentioned?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的啊，她非常擔心我，我們是工作上的夥伴啊！當我請了2天假，她非常想念我啊！
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'missed' should come before the subject 'she'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean because you took two days off so the woman sends this message to you? Without your assistance, so she missed you? Is that…?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊，這就是內容啊！那簡訊根本就沒什麼
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'no big deal' is translated as '根本就沒什麼', which does not capture the casual and dismissive tone of the original.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
OK, and the second message is sent in the same number at 11:55 pm January 13th 2013. The content is “I want you by my side, when can we be together?” So what does this message mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
null

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You mean the woman sent you the message just to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太跟庭上說的啊，我正在上碩士的課。在這個課程，我必須修滿30學分我才能得到學位。而我也需要完成一些作業和練習。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain that what is your major in your master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的主要課程是英語教學。在那個課程中，有些是有關英語教學的，有些則是有關文化和語言能力。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' instead of '計畫' or '方案'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我的主要課程是英語教學' instead of '主要課程是我的英語教學'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information about the program being TESOL. It should be '我的主要課程是TESOL的英語教學' instead of '我的主要課程是英語教學'.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So what you learn is English teaching, but there are some cultural courses in this program?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少三門課是跟文化和溝通有關。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'courses' in their translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'related to' as '跟有關', which does not accurately convey the meaning of 'related to'.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what’s the assignment that this course will require?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'this' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這文化溝通課程的作業會依每個學生而不一樣。以我自己為例，我來台灣是為了想要找到教學的工作，為了達成這個目標並表達我有足夠的能力，我必須擁有足夠的中文。所以很多作業都是有關中英翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '以我自己為例，我來台灣是為了想要找到教學的工作'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. The verb '是' should agree with the subject '我自己' and be in the form '是'. The correct form should be '以我自己為例，我來台灣是為了想要找到教學的工作'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	There is a tense error in the sentence. The verb '來' should be in the past tense to indicate that the action of coming to Taiwan has already happened. The correct form should be '以我自己為例，我來台灣是為了想要找到教學的工作'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	There is a mismatched meaning in the translation. The phrase '表達我有足夠的能力' is translated as 'prove my competence', but a more accurate translation would be 'express my competence' or 'demonstrate my competence'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	There is an omission of important details in the translation. The phrase 'many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation' is not included in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	There is a critical context that is left out in the translation. The phrase 'To reach this goal' is not included, which provides important context for the sentence.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The translation does not convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness. The phrase '以我自己為例' is translated as 'Take myself for example', which is too informal. A more appropriate translation would be 'For example, in my case' or 'As an example, I'.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean you want to teach Chinese in Taiwan, so in this program of master degree you have to prove your have competence of Chinese. And you have to finish assignment in this course, and some of the assignment is about English and Chinese translation?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of completing assignments as part of the course.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，而且我還被要求要訓練我的口說和寫作能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s move back to the message we mentioned before. Is that your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是啊，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這個中文句子，我不知道要怎麼翻譯。你也知道有些中文字對外國人來說非常難。我需要一些幫助，所以我就請我的同事幫忙。我請她幫我翻譯這個句子然後再傳簡訊給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean you sent the Chinese sentence to your co-worker and she translated it into English and sent back to you, is that right? So the message is the answer to your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，這封簡訊只是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the message being a text message.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Now let’s take a look at page 14-16 on file 1. Please take a look at it. Are all those messages sent by your co-worker just because you want to do your homework?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the assistant seeking help from the co-worker for the messages.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是啊，這些簡訊全都是為了要完成我的作業才傳的
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
And what’s your explanation about that your wife suspected you have adultery with your co-worker Cai Yan Wang?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '解釋' as 'explanation' instead of 'explanation about'
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'that' after 'explanation' instead of before
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'your wife suspected' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'with your co-worker Cai Yan Wang' in the translation

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我覺得我太太想太多了。我知道她對我無法扶養這個家庭感到不滿意。我希望法庭知道我開始上課時我太太都不支持我。她不願意幫助我得到這個學位。如果她能多一點支持我的話，我就不會請我同事幫忙了。我覺得她該為這個誤會負責。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我覺得我太太想太多了' is incorrect. It should be '我覺得我太太想太多了'.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我希望法庭知道我開始上課時我太太都不支持我' is incorrect. It should be '我希望法庭知道我開始上課時我太太都不支持我'.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to what you said, it seems that you do not interact with your wife so happily?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚時我們關係還算好。但問題就是我的工作問題。我想要在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是工作時數一直不穩定。所以工作問題就變成我們2個之間關係的問題了。我們常常為了這個問題吵架，她不相信我已經盡力了，我也無法讓她了解我是多麼的無力還有我面臨的…
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們常常為了這個問題吵架' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們常常因為這個問題吵架'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
OK, let’s move back to the master program you mentioned. When did your master degree program started? Did you finish it? Did you get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question about when the master program ended.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question about whether the user got the degree.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這個碩士課程從2010年春季開始。它是2年的課程。這個課程應該在12月22日就完成了。我沒有完成這個課程因為我有兼一些工作，所以沒時間做功課。就像我說的，我太太都不支持我，我覺得我都是孤軍奮鬥在完成那個課程的。我覺得非常疲累也非常無力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '這個課程應該在12月22日就完成了' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這個課程應該在2012年12月完成了'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb '開始' should be past tense '開始了' to match the past time frame of '2010年春季'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the specific month in which the program should have been finished. The original text mentions 'December 2012' as the expected completion date.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the reason for not finishing the program. The original text mentions that the user didn't have enough time to do course assignments due to working part-time.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling tired and frustrated. The original text mentions that the user became too tired and frustrated.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the lack of support from the wife. The original text mentions that the wife has never been very supportive.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling alone in pursuing the degree. The original text mentions that the user felt that they were pursuing the degree all alone by themselves.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the wife's lack of support being a contributing factor to not finishing the program. The original text mentions that the lack of support from the wife was one of the reasons for not finishing the program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling tired and frustrated being a contributing factor to not finishing the program. The original text mentions that feeling tired and frustrated was one of the reasons for not finishing the program.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mean the program is two-year but you didn’t finish it, why?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我無法完成所有課程的要求
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
When your registered semester end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我最後一個註冊學期是2012年…
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'fall' which is an important detail in the original text.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So according to what you said, that your program will end on December 5th 2012, then after that you won’t have any assignment. However, after your program ended, the message between you and your co-worker is still keep going, then why?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '課程結束' as 'program ended' instead of 'course ended'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'six months' in the translation.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我沒完成那個學位並不代表我不想再增進我的語言能力。雖然課程結束了，但是我還是想要學中文
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about studying on their own after failing the program.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that although you failed your master degree program, you still want to improve your Chinese competence, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the person failed their master's degree program, while the original text does not mention any failure.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
沒錯，這就是為甚麼我要請我的同事幫忙。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'asked' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the role your co-worker plays is a little like your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是家教，她也是我真正的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Do you pay her?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'pay' should be in the past tense to agree with the past tense of 'have'.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
我有說要付錢給她，但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The verb '拒絕了' should come before the subject '她'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why she bothered to send you the message to help you to learn Chinese in the mid-night? Is this behavior just beyond the co-worker’s behavior?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我說的，她是非常支持我的朋友，她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是非常支持我的朋友'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the friend was helping the user learn Chinese. The correct translation should include '她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach English in that cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Do you still teach English in that cram school?'

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那邊工作

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
So the co-worker Cai Yan Wang is also working there now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她還在那邊工作啊，但我們不再是一起教書的夥伴了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們不再是一起教書的夥伴了' instead of '但我們不再是一起教書的夥伴了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Prosecutor, do you have any evidence or witness that you want to subpoena?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you have any evidence or witness that you want to subpoena, prosecutor?'

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena the defendant’s co-worker, which is Cai Wan Wang, working in the Bo Yuan cram school. I hope her to explain the relationship between the defendant and her and the purpose of those messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'as a witness' after 'I hope her to explain'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'hope' instead of 'hopes' to match the subject 'I'.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'subpoena' instead of 'summon' to convey the meaning of requesting someone to appear in court.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user used 'defendant' instead of 'accused' to refer to the person involved in the case.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user used 'co-worker' instead of 'colleague' to refer to the person from the same workplace.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user used 'cram school' instead of 'tutorial center' to refer to the place of work.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user used 'those messages' instead of 'those text messages' to specify the type of messages being referred to.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The plaintiff, do you have any evidence that you want to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court in the translation, which is an important detail.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has take some action about the relationship between my husband and his co-worker. And they tried to persuade to quit the job. I hope that the court can confirm this from the cram school.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女王彩燕' as 'my husband's co-worker' instead of 'Queen Caiyan'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'Queen Caiyan' being the target of the cram school's actions.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the mention of 'my husband' and 'his co-worker' which are not present in the original text.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence you hope the court to investigate? Now the situation is that your master program has finished on December 5th 2012. There is no reason you send the message between you and your co-worker just to finish your assignment. Especially that the messages between your co-worker and you are after 9 pm, it’s a little suspectful. Do you have any evidence that will help you with your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'There is no reason you send the message between you and your co-worker just to finish your assignment' is incorrect. It should be 'There is no reason for you to send the message between you and your co-worker just to finish your assignment'.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我目前想不到任何證據可以請法院幫我調查的。就像我說的，我跟我同事對話目的都沒什麼。我只是想要增進我的語言能力和學中文
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'on my behalf' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
So the cross-questioning procedure will be set at 4:30 pm June 9th 2014. The plaintiff and the defendant, you have to attend the court on that day. If necessary, you can have your lawyer, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我明白。

今天庭期到此結束。

Yes, I understand

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, I want to ask the plaintiff, how long have you and your husband been married?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated '先請問告訴人' as 'First, I want to ask the plaintiff', which is a literal translation. However, in the context of a court setting, '告訴人' refers to the person making the accusation or complaint, not the plaintiff.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years and we have no children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you get married in Taiwan or outside Taiwan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan. Four years ago when he first came to Taiwan, he came to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the pass few years, has he been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Has he been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan in the past few years?'

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
He was a Portuguese Teacher when we first met. And after we got married, he still teaches Portuguese. But Portuguese is not that much a popular language, so his working hours are unstable. Sometimes there are even periods between jobs in months. In this sense, he wanted to have a more stable job, so he started teaching English. As English is not his mother tongue, he decided to seek an advance degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'And after we got married, he still teaches Portuguese' is incorrect. It should be 'And after we got married, he still taught Portuguese.'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'teaches' should be in the past tense to match the past event of getting married. It should be 'taught' instead.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the husband's decision to teach English was driven by the desire for a more stable income.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the information that the husband decided to seek an advanced degree to improve his English teaching skills.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You said about seeking a more advance degree. Do you mean he intended to study in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '台灣' as 'Taiwan' instead of 'in Taiwan'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
He wants to teach in Taiwan, so the degree he’s seeking must be related to TESOL. He found a distance learning program of the University of California on the internet. So he doesn’t have to be in the States to get the degree, instead he could get the degree by distant learning. So he can manage to get the degree after he finished all the credits. His plan is that to get the degree licensed by the United states, he could get an English teaching job here in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'So he doesn’t have to be in the States to get the degree, instead he could get the degree by distant learning' is incorrect. It should be 'So he doesn’t have to be in the States to get the degree, instead he could get the degree through distance learning.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the distance learning program is offered by the University of California.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the degree the person is seeking is related to TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person's plan is to get a degree licensed by the United States in order to find an English teaching job in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So what exactly is the relationship between your husband and his mistress in this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They’re partners and co-workers in cram school. So in the cram school, they have a policy to partner the foreign teacher with the local teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the female teacher being the local teacher in the original text.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
Then you do you know they’re having an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, the only thing I found was that my husband was lengthening his shift. I asked him isn’t it just a cram school, what’s there to be lengthening your working hours? What he told me was that, since he has to partner with the local teacher therefore he needs more time to practice. I did not doubt him at first. Then after a while, he had been picking up phone calls after his work shifts. And after he picked up the phone, he wouldn’t talk in frond of me, instead he talked in the study room. This made me very suspicious, so I checked his phonebook.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband was staying late at school.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'picked up' before the subject 'he' in the sentence 'Then after a while, he had been picking up phone calls after his work shifts.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband was receiving calls in the study room.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the wife checked her husband's phonebook.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you find anything unusual in his phonebook?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '不尋常的' as 'unusual' instead of 'in his phonebook'

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I found a constantly dialed number. Being very curious, I also checked his text message. And this was when I discovered that he was contacting this mistress.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'mistress' is not an accurate translation for '一個女的' which means 'a woman'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Well, after all it’s just text message, is there anything that’s inappropriate?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misunderstanding the cultural context

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it was just very simple text message, I wouldn’t go for it. But he’s a married man, how could he let a woman send him some intimate messages? I have provided some evidence for the court, I think they are in the case files.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了' as 'If it was just very simple text message'. The correct translation is 'If it was just a normal text message'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢?' as 'how could he let a woman send him some intimate messages?'. The correct translation is 'how could he let the other party send some very intimate words?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing evidence to the court in the translation.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the mention of the text messages being included in the case files.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please see the evidence file 1. Here are several text message content, defendant please take a look. Are these text messages sent from your phone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
對 這確實是我手機裡的手機內容
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I’m going to ask you a few questions based on these text messages. The first text message was sent at nine fifty PM on the 31st of November 2013 from the cellphone 0958-932***. The content was內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated the message as a question instead of a statement.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這只是我同事傳給我的啦, 我記得那時候我剛好修了兩天假, 他大概有點擔心吧所以他才傳這封簡訊, 我的同事是在美國接受教育地所以他的思想非常開放, 那就是他表達的方式啊, 至於說 噢 我的愛  那只是對關心的人表達的一種方式
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'colleague' as '同事' instead of '同僚'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	misinterpretation of 'open-minded' as '思想非常開放' instead of '心胸開闊'
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of 'my love' as '我的愛' instead of '親愛的'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So you mean your colleague is more westernized because she studied in the United States. And she’s more open minded in terms of emotions.So the content my love doesn’t have any special meaning right?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the phrase '我的愛' as having no special meaning, when in fact it is a term of endearment commonly used in Chinese culture.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
當然不是啊, 這在好朋友和老朋友之間是很正常的表達方式
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
How about her previous sentence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'How' at the beginning of the sentence.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
如我所說, 她只是擔心我而已, 我們就是工作的同事/夥伴, 當我請了兩天假, 她很自然而然的想念我
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'worried about me' as '只是擔心我而已' which means 'just worried about me'. The correct translation should be '擔心我' which means 'worried about me' without the 'just'.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
You mean she sent you this text message just because you didn’t come to work for two days? Without your assistance she missed you? Is that it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the person missed the user's assistance.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
對啊  最主要就是這樣, 這封簡訊的內容就單純只是這樣而已
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the message was 'no big deal,' but the user's translation does not capture this meaning.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
So the second text message was sent at 23:55, 13th of January 2013 from the same cellphone 0958, is that right? 內容是我真的好想你, 希望你真的能陪在我身邊, What do you mean by that? Can you elaborate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她這麼發訊息只是告訴我我的中文作業理該怎麼表達
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
You’re saying that she sent you this message so as to help you huh?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
當我太太像法院提出告訴, 我正在休息我的碩士學位, 要取得那個學位我必須先完成30個學分, 我自然而然需要完成一些作業和課業
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of attending a Master's program in their translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of completing assignments and exercises in their translation.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what exactly are you studying in your master profra
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的學位是英語教學碩士學位, 這學位的內容有部分是英語教學, 那其他部分還包含文化課程和語言能力
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '學位' which means 'degree' instead of '課程' which means 'program' in this context.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'TESOL program' is translated as '英語教學碩士學位' which means 'Master's degree in English teaching' instead of 'TESOL課程' which means 'TESOL program'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that 'some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence'.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the word '還' which means 'also' and is not present in the original text.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you’re getting a degree in TESOL, and there are cross cultural communication courses in this program right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
對 我記得至少有三門課是跟文化還有溝通有關
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what kind of assignments do they give you in the cultural communication courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'they' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
文化溝通的作業會因學生而異, 就我自己來舉例, 我在台灣試圖尋求英語教學的工作機會, 為了達到這個目標, 我必須證明我有中文能力, 所以我的一些作業內容就會包含中英翻譯
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就我自己來舉例, 文化溝通的作業會因學生而異'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'culture and communication courses' as '文化溝通的作業' is incorrect. It should be translated as '文化與溝通課程'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the assignments are for the culture and communication courses. This detail is important for understanding the context.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the assignments are for the purpose of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the assignments are about Chinese-English sentence translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the phrase '為了達到這個目標' (to achieve this goal), which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the phrase '所以我的一些作業內容就會包含中英翻譯' (so some of my assignments will include Chinese-English translation), which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the phrase '試圖尋求英語教學的工作機會' (trying to seek a teaching position as an English teacher), which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the phrase '為了達到這個目標, 我必須證明我有中文能力' (to achieve this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese), which is not present in the original text.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
You mean because you’re planning to teach in Taiwan so you have to show that you have some Chinese competence right? As a result you have to complete some Chinese courses, and in these courses, there are Chinese-english translation right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
當然, 我也被要求要加強我的口說和寫作能力
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Ok, back to the beginning, this is your assignment right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is this your assignment?'

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對 我記得這個句子, 當我得到這個句子時 我並不知道他的英文怎麼說, 妳也知道有些中文字對外國人來說真的非常難以辨認, 我需要一些協助所以才跟我同是協助, 我叫他幫我翻譯這個句子然後再用訊息傳給我
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
You mean because you asked your colleague about the sentence in Chinese so that’s why she sent it to you in English? So the message was simply an answer for the assignment right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對  那只是作業的答案
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
So now, we’ll see page 14 and 16 in the invest gory file, please check the content. So the colleague sent you these messages because you have problem finishing your assignments.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對  所有訊息的目的都一樣是幫助我完成功課
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So upon your wife’s lawsuit against your colleague 王彩文 what do you say about that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 王彩燕 (Wang Caiyan) as 王彩文 (Wang Caiwen), changing the meaning of the name.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我覺得我太太真的想太多了, 我知道她對於我負擔家計的能力感到不滿足, 我希望庭上能了解她對我的學習從來沒有任何支持, 她根本不想幫助我完成我的學業, 她如果能支持我我根本不會找我的同事來幫助我我覺得這些誤會應該怪我太太
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of 'blamed' as '怪'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in '我覺得這些誤會應該怪我太太'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'ability of supporting the family'

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, there seems to be some quarrels between you and your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們新婚的時候我們確實有一些美好時光, 但工作就是一個大問題, 我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文但我的時數不夠, 所以工作就變成我們爭吵的課題我們三不五時就為這吵架, 她不認為我有努力的付出, 所以她完成無法了解我辛苦的付出
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '我們三不五時就為這吵架' should be '我們三不五時就為這個問題吵架'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Ok, back to the master program we talked about. When did you start your master program? Did you get the degree and are you done with it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我在2010年的春天開始這個課程, 這是兩年的課程, 我原本應該在2012年的12月完成學位, 可是因為工作忙碌的關係, 我並沒有足夠的時間來完成學位要求的一些作業, 就像我說的我太太一直都不支持我, 我覺得我好像自己一個人在為這個學位努力, 我既疲累又身心俱疲.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'program' as '課程' is incorrect. It should be translated as '計劃' or '項目'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我原本應該在2012年的12月完成學位' is incorrect. It should be '我原本應該在2012年12月完成學位'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker didn't finish the program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker became tired and frustrated.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker's wife was not supportive.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker felt like they were pursuing the degree alone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the speaker was working part-time and didn't have enough time for course assignments.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the program started in Spring 2010.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the program was a two-year program.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So the duration of this program is two years, but you didn’t finish it, why?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out reason for not finishing the program

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我無法達成學位所有要求的課程
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'finish' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
So when was the last registration of this semester?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋天
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'registration' in their translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'fall 2012' as '2012年的秋天', which means 'autumn of 2012', instead of 'fall 2012'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you said about the last registration, it ends on the fifth of December 2012, so after that, you shouldn’t have anything to do with the program right? But the text message between you and your colleague continued six months after your program, and why’s that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '課程結束' as 'program' instead of 'course'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'text message' in their translation.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我沒有拿到學位, 我也想增進我的中文能力啊, 就算沒拿到學位我也想增進我的中文能力, 所以我精益求精的學中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '就算我沒有拿到學位，我也想增進我的中文能力。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'Even when I failed the program' in the translation.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '我精益求精的' which is not present in the original text.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean even if you didn’t get the degree, you still want to continue to practice your Chinese, is that true?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
對  所以我才求助於我的同事
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in their translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleague is like your tutor huh?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'tutor' instead of 'housekeeper'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是個家教而已, 她是個真正的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Did you pay her?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you pay her?' instead of 'You did pay her?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
不, 我想要付她錢, 但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想要付她錢' instead of '我想要她付錢'.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
So if you didn’t pay her, why did she continue to send you these text messages even in sleeping hours? Don’t you think that your relationship was beyond coworkers?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
如我所說她是非常挺我的朋友, 她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '她是非常挺我的朋友' instead of '如我所說她是非常挺我的朋友'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teach in the same cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
對, 我還在那工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
And your colleague王彩燕, does she still work in the same cram school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那裏工作, 但我們已經不一起搭檔了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不一起搭檔了' instead of '但我們已經不一起搭檔了'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
Is there any other evidence or witness? Prosecutor?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena the defendant’s colleague to the court to witness for this case. So she can clarify about her relationship with the defendant and her purpose of sending those messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague's name and the name of the tutoring center.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'witness' instead of 'testify'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Is there any other evidence that the plaintiff wish the court to investigate?

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence that could help you?Well, the point is your master program should have end on the 5th of December 2012. There’s no reason to keep contact with 王彩燕 because of the assignment right? Especially, you two usually send text message after 9 PM and that’s a little bit weird. Do you have any evidence that could help you?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misinterpretation of '希望' as 'want' instead of 'hope'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect placement of 'Well' at the beginning of the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase '法庭為你調查的事證' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase '你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？' in the translation

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我不認為庭上有任何能幫助我的證據, 如我所說, 我和我同事連絡的目的非常簡單, 只是想提升我的語言能力繼續進修中文
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
Ok, we will have our witness on the ninth of June 2014 for the witness procedure. Plaintiff and defendant, both of you have to show up on that date. If necessary, you can hire an attorney, do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Plaintiff and defendant, both of you have to show up on that date.'

我明白。
Yes, I understand.

I understand.
我明白

今天庭期到此結束。
Ok, we dismiss the court.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'today' and 'here' in the original text.

被告是否了解以上權利？

是的，我了解。

今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The plaintiff, Ms. 陳玉華 filed the case. The reason is that her husband John Anderson has intimate relationship with his colleague. Besides, the plaintiff found that there are some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. Plus, the defendant has often made up reasons for working overtime or chatting with his colleague, Ms. 王彩燕, in the middle of the night via tele-conferencing or other ways. The contents of the messages collected by the plaintiff are considered beyond co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, simply speaking, your wife doubts that you have an affair and accused you of adultery. What’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'The plaintiff, Ms. 陳玉華 filed the case.' It should be 'The plaintiff, Ms. 陳玉華, filed the case.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'The defendant, simply speaking, your wife doubts that you have an affair and accused you of adultery.' It should be 'The defendant, simply speaking, your wife doubts that you have an affair and accuses you of adultery.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the charge of adultery in the original text. The phrase '要告你通姦罪' should be translated as 'accuses you of adultery.'

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯，當然。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'Of course, not guilty.'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, the major purpose is to ask about the details of phone records between the defendant and his colleague.The purpose is to clarity whether the defendant truly has an affair with his colleague and constitute adultery. Do both parties understand the procedure?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user incorrectly translated '詢問' as 'ask about' instead of 'inquire about'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通訊細節' as 'phone records' instead of 'communication details'.
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of '被告與其同事' in the translation.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user added the phrase 'and constitute adultery' which is not present in the original text.

先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, I will ask the plaintiff some questions. How long have you been married to your husband? Do you have children?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated '告訴人' as 'plaintiff' which is a legal term and not appropriate in this context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the question mark at the beginning of the sentence instead of at the end.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for four years, and we don't have children.

那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
Did you marry your husband abroad or in Taiwan?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and mainly wanted to teach Portuguese.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they are also from Taiwan.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
For past few years, is hid job here to teach Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he had kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hours were unstable. Sometimes, there would be a period of one or two months between two teaching courses. Later on, to make his income more stable, he wanted to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean that he would like to pursue a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of the original text

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to receive a degree of TESOL. He found a distance learning program offered by California in the United States online. Therefore, he could complete the course requirements by the means of online learning without going to the United States in person. After receiving all the credits, he could receive a master degree. His plan is that with such a degree offered by the United States, he can find a position as an English teacher in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'He found a distance learning program offered by California in the United States online.' The correct word order should be: 'He found an online distance learning program offered by California in the United States.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific degree that the person needed to obtain in order to teach English in Taiwan. The correct translation should include 'TESOL' (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) as the required degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'distance learning' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'online' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'position' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What is the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'husband' in the translation.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
The cram school partner a foreign teacher with a Chinese teacher for teaching, and that woman is his teaching partner.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know your husband has an affair with his colleague?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the original meaning of the sentence.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At the beginning, I just noticed that my husband often worked overtime at the cram school. I have asked him several times. Why does he have to work overtime at a cram school? He told me that because he had to partner with a Chinese teacher for teaching, many details have to be discussed. 一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，I truly had no doubts on his saying at first. However, I later found out that after he arrived home, he frequently received calls. In addition, he never answered the calls in front of me. Instead, he would go to the study room to talk on the phone. That made me suspect him, so I checked his cellphone.

omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	addition of 'I truly had no doubts on his saying at first.'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Do you find anything unusual in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I often saw a certain set of numbers in the records of his phone book, so I checked his messages out of curiosity. Then I found that he has texted with a woman almost every single day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific phone number that caught their attention.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'records of his phone book' instead of 'communication records'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the fact that they checked the messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention their surprise or curiosity about the frequent communication.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '簡訊' as 'messages' instead of 'text messages'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not specify the gender of the person the subject was texting with.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention the frequency of the text messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
Is it actually all right with texting messages, right? Is the content very inappropriate?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If they are common messages, it is fine. However, he is married. How could that woman always send him some intimate sentences? Earlier on, I have provided the court with some contents of their messages. They should be in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '可是他是一個已婚的人' as 'However, he is married' instead of 'However, he is a married person'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of providing the court with the contents of their messages.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please show the file one, page 13. There are some contents of several messages. The defendant, please verify whether the messages are from your cellphone?

Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
是的，這些是我手機裡的簡訊。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
 I have some questions for you based on these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50 at night on November 31st in 2012 from the number 0958932 and so on. The content said that “I really miss you, my love.”What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated the message correctly, but provided a literal translation instead of conveying the intended meaning.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
這的確是我同事傳的簡訊。她只是關心我、擔心我，所以發簡訊給我。我同事在美國受教育的，她思想很西化，這就是她說話、表達情感的方式。至於「我的愛」一詞，這只是對我們關心的人的稱呼而已。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
You said that the sender was educated abroad, so her thoughts are quite westernised, and the way she expresses herself is more open, so the word “my love”does not carry any special meaning, right?
minor categories of cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not accurately translate the idiomatic expression '我的愛' which means 'my love'.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對，這只是一種普遍稱呼好朋友和關心的人的方式而已。
minor categories of cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
And the sentence in front?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
像我說的，她只是關心我，我們是工作夥伴。當我休假兩天的時候，她當然會想我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '像我說的，她只是關心我'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'partners' is translated as '工作夥伴' which means 'work partners' instead of '合作夥伴' which means 'partners'.
omission or addition	omission of details	The user's translation omits the word 'naturally' which is an important detail in the original text.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that because you were off for two days, she sent you such a message, and because without your assistance in the courses, she missed you so much? Is that it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by adding the idea that the person missed the user because of their absence from work and assistance in courses.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
這就是簡訊內容，並沒有什麼特別的。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the message being a text message.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
And the second message was sent at 11:55 at night on January 13th, 2013 via the same phone number. The content was that “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?”What does that mean? Why did the sender text you such a message?

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她只是告訴我作業中的一句中文怎麼寫而已。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
Do you mean that she sent you this message only for helping you complete your assignment? What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
像我太太剛剛告訴法院的，我在修一個碩士課程。課程中，我必須完成三十個學分才能拿到學位。我當然必須完成一些作業和習題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '像我太太剛剛告訴法院的，我在修一個碩士課程。'

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
 Could you elaborate    what you exactly study for your master’s degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我修的是英語教學，有些課和英語教學有關，有些跟文化和語言能力有關。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
So you study a master program on TESOL, and some courses are related to culture communications, right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得至少有三門課和文化溝通有關
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What kind of assignments were be given by such courses of culture and communication?

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通課程的作業因學生而異。以我自己為例。我住在台灣，想要找到教英文的工作。為了達成這個目標，並精進語文能力，我必須有好的中文能力。因此，我有很多作業跟中英翻譯有關。

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Do you mean that because you planned to teach English in Taiwan, this program requires you to prove you have a certain level of Chinese ability? And therefore, you have to complete some assignments give by the courses, which is sentence translation? Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
對的，我當然必須精進我的口說和寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
All right, let’s go back to that sentence. You said that was your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，我記得這個句子。我剛開始不知道那些中文句子用英文該怎麼說。有些中文字對外國人來說很難認。我需要一些協助，所以請同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯句子，用簡訊傳給我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
grammar and structure	pronoun errors	The pronoun 'her' should be 'him' to match the gender of the colleague.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the translation of the sentence in their response.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the idiomatic expression '用簡訊傳給我' (sent me a text message) to the target language.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Do you mean that you asked your colleague how to say that sentence in Chinese, and she texted you the answer? Is that the scenario? In other words, the content of the message is only the answer to the assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
簡訊內容就是我的作業答案。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the message was a text message.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Then please show the contents of all the messages on page 14 to page 16 in the file one. Please verify the messages. Is it because that you has to do your assignments and ask for help from your colleague, asking her to send you messages?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the messages on pages 14 to 16.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added unnecessary information about doing assignments and asking for help from a colleague.

 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，所有簡訊都是為了幫助我完成作業。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'purpose' as '幫助' which means 'help' instead of '目的' which means 'purpose'.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Your wife just said that you have an affair with your colleague, 王彩燕, what is your explanation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'affair' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
我太太真的想太多了！我想她只是不滿意我賺錢的能力。我想告訴庭上，我太太從一開始就完全不支持我念碩士，她並不願意幫助我完成學業。如果她願意支持我一點點，我不會請同事幫忙。我覺得她自己應該為這誤解負責。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the tone and intention of the original text

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your saying, there are some unpleasant situations between you and your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
剛結婚的時候，我們的確渡過了一段美好時光，但是問題出在我的工作。我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是授課時數很不穩定，所以我的工作就成了我們之間的問題。我們常常為這個問題吵架。她不相信我已經盡力了，我也無法讓她理解我遇到的挫折和困難。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們的確渡過了一段美好時光' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們確實渡過了一段美好時光'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '但是問題出在我的工作' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但問題出在我的工作'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想在台灣教葡萄牙文'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '所以我的工作就成了我們之間的問題' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我的工作就成了我們之間的問題'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我們常常為這個問題吵架' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們常常為這個問題吵架'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Well, let’s go back to the master program, which you just talked about. When did you start your program, and does it end? Did you receive the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'end' should be in the past tense to match the question.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'receive' should be in the past tense to match the question.

I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我的碩士課程從2010年春天開始，是兩年的課程，應該要在2012年12月完成課程。但是我沒有完成課程，因為我有兼差，沒有時間完成我的課程作業。像我說的，我太太並不支持我。我覺得是自己一路單獨奮鬥，感覺很累、很有挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我的碩士課程從2010年春天開始' is incorrect. It should be '從2010年春天開始的我的碩士課程'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb '開始' should be past tense to match the English original text. It should be '開始了'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the program was a two-year program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the speaker did not finish the program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the reason for not finishing the program, which is that the speaker did not have enough time to do their course assignments due to working part-time.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the speaker's wife was not supportive.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the speaker felt they were pursuing the degree alone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the speaker became tired and frustrated.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the speaker should have finished the program in December 2012.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the speaker started the program in Spring 2010.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the information that the speaker was working part-time.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
Do you mean that the program should have lasted for two years, but you did not complete it, and why?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
我無法完成所有的課程要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'couldn't' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
What did it end, the last semester that you registered?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
我註冊的最後一個學期是在2012年秋季。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '2012年秋季'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If as you said, your last semester ended on December 5th in 2012, based on reasonable doubts, you would have no assignments after that, right? How would you continue sending messages with your colleagues even until six months after the program was ended?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '合理推斷' as 'based on reasonable doubts' instead of 'reasonable inference'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'based on reasonable doubts' in the wrong position in the sentence.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我也許無法完成課程，但不代表我不想精進語言能力。即使我不能完成課程，我還是很想加強我的中文能力，所以我繼續自我學習。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'program' in the translation.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Do you mean that even though  you failed to complete the master program, you still want to sharpen your Chinese ability and make your Chinese more fluent, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
是，我請同事幫忙。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So that colleague plays a role as a tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅是個家教，也是我真正的好友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎？
Have you offered her any pay?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be 'Have you paid her any money?'

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我想要付她錢，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我想要付她錢，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you had not paid her, why would she like to send you messages to answer your questions even in the middle of the night, when she should go to bed for sleep?
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'should' should be in the past tense 'should have' to indicate a missed opportunity or action in the past.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence should be 'even in the middle of the night' instead of 'in the middle of the night even'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text questions why the person would go through the trouble of answering the user's questions, not why they would like to send messages.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
因此我認為她是非常支持我的，她用自己的時間幫助我學習中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因此我認為她是非常支持我的'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work as an English teacher at that cram school now?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那裡工作。

那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is that colleague, 王彩燕, still working there, too?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Is that colleague, 王彩燕, still working there?'

She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more.
她也還在那裡工作，但我們不再是工作夥伴了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們不再是工作夥伴了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any further evidence to be investigated or people to be subpoenaed?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
We would like to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, 王彩燕, as a witness to the court to elaborate her relationship with the defendant and the background as well as the purpose of writing these messages?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's colleague's workplace, which is important information for the court.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the name '王彩燕' after the phrase 'the colleague of the defendant', which is incorrect word order.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The plaintiff, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I have heard that the cram school has taken some actions because of their relationship. The cram school even tried to persuade Ms. 王彩燕 to leave the job position. I am wandering whether we can verify these facts with the cram school.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '女王' as 'Ms.' instead of 'Queen'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'wandering' before the subject 'I'. The correct word order should be 'I am wandering'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'Queen' before '彩燕'. The correct translation should be 'Queen 王彩燕'.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? The current situation is that your master program was ended on December 5th, 2012, and there are no reasons for you to take completing assignments as an excuse to explain the interaction of texting messages between you and 王彩燕, especially your interactions were mostly after 9 o’clock at night. This behaviour causes doubts. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?' The correct word order should be: 'Do you, the defendant, have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '被告' as 'The defendant' which is a correct translation. However, the user translated '案情' as 'case' instead of 'evidence'. The correct translation should be 'Do you have any evidence that can help your case?'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '王彩燕' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我無法想到有任何證據是法院可以代表我調查的。如我所說，我和同事間的溝通很簡單。我只是想要精進中文能力，繼續學習中文。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court's role in the original text, which is an important detail.

那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court date is set at 4:30 in the afternoon on June 9th, 2014 for asking the witness. The plaintiff and the defendant, please do  come on that day. If necessary, the both parties have the right to hire lawyers. Do you understand?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

我明白。
 I understand.

今天庭期到此結束。

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'summary' which is an important detail in the original text.

如起訴書所載。
As stated in the indictment.

被告因妨害名譽案件被檢察官起訴，起因是被告涉嫌在中華民國108年12月1日到109年1月20日之間，在網際網路論壇，名為Foreign Land (外國園地)，發表一連串的評論，雖此論壇之主要目的是提供在台居留外國人士交流之平台，但被告卻利用這樣一個平台進行對告訴人公司之批評，致使告訴人公司名譽受損。對此妨害名譽之告訴，有何辯解？
This incident happened on December 1, 2019 to January 20, 2020. The accused post the comments on the internet chat forum, Foreign Land, which provides foreigners in Taiwan to communicate with others. However, the accused used this platform to criticize the accuser’s company, which damaged the accuser’s company reputation, so the accused was prosecuted. What’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'This incident happened on December 1, 2019 to January 20, 2020' is incorrect. It should be 'This incident happened from December 1, 2019 to January 20, 2020.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '告訴人' as 'accuser' instead of 'complainant'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the accused was charged with defamation.

I plead not guilty.
我沒有罪。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'plead' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I plead not guilty.'

請問你知道「外國園地」這個論壇嗎？
The defendant, do you know the Internet forum, Foreign Land
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '外國園地' as 'Foreign Land' instead of 'Foreign Forum'.

Yes, Foreign Land is a forum very popular among foreigners.
我知道這個Foreign Land非常受歡迎，尤其是在外國人當中。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

可以簡要的描述你在這個平台上的活動嗎？
Can you summarize your activities on Foreign Land?

I am a registered member, which means I can read others’ posts and post articles for others to read.
我是有註冊的會員，我可以看到別人發表的文章，同時也可以發表自己的文章給別人看。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你常常在上面發表文章嗎，可以大概抓個頻率嗎，大概多久發表一篇文章？
How often you post comments on the Foreign Land? ...
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How often do you post comments on the Foreign Land?'

I won’t say I regularly post articles on Foreign Land. I only have postings when I want to share some concerns or vent my feelings.
我不會說我常常在上面發文，我只有在我有一些疑慮，還有想要發洩一些情緒的時候才會在上面發文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我不會說我常常在上面發文'.

提示偵券(一)65頁。這一頁是取自中華民國108年12月13日在「外國園地」中發表的內容。請你看一下，這是你寫的嗎？
… The page is about your comments on Foreign Land on December 13, 2019. Please take a look. Are these your posts?

It seems to be my posting but it was posted some time ago, I am not sure if the article is in its entirety.
我有發表這個文章，但是是在很久之前發表的，所以我不確定文章的完整性。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user mentions that the article was posted a long time ago, but does not provide any information about the specific details that may be missing from their translation.

As you can see from the copy, I posted some concerns and questions regarding Winwin company, especially about how foreigners were treated by that company.
…我在上面發表了我的疑慮、對公司的一些問題，還有他們怎麼對待外國員工。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not include the specific concerns and questions mentioned in the original text.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation does not accurately convey the tone and level of politeness used in the original text.

你剛剛講到的某一公司，請問有在任何一篇文章當中，明確指出該公司的全名嗎？
You mentioned the full name of the company. Did you point out its name in any comments?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the name of the company in their translation.

Yes, I am sure I have used the company’s full name, Winwin.
我確定我有在上面用公司的全名，贏贏。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the company's full name, 'Winwin', in the translation.

你在65頁的內容中，提到該公司常常在雇用外國人時，沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利，更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況。請問，你這樣講，有證據嗎？
In Page 65, you mentioned this company hired foreign employee without following Labor Basic Law about work time, basic wage and benefits. The company didn’t help foreigners apply for working visa. For this, do you have any evidence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of evidence in their translation.

I did mention those issues. I did not have evidence. I heard those issues from some other foreign friends who either worked for that company or had experiences with that company. As a result, I expressed my concerns in the question format, meaning I asked all those questions regarding working hours, basic salary, benefits and ARC application with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions.
我有講過這個問題，但我沒有證據。我是從我一些在那個公司工作的朋友或是在那邊有經驗的朋友聽來的。我有在論壇發表一些問題，包含了工作時數、基本薪資、福利，還有是否幫員工申請居留簽證…。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of expressing concerns in the question format.
omission or addition	leaving out critical context	The user left out the context of expressing concerns about the company.
omission or addition	neglecting to translate essential terms or phrases	The user did not translate 'Winwin' which is a company name.

你的意思是說，你是從其他外國朋友那邊聽到這些細節，但不是本人的第一手資料，是嗎？
You mean that you heard from you friends, but it isn’t your first-hand information, right?

True. I heard those details from other friends, also the registered members of Foreign Land.
沒錯，我是從朋友還有一些註冊會員那邊聽到這些小細節的。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'other' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'registered members of Foreign Land' in the translation, which is a crucial detail in the original text.

那你怎麼可以在一個公開的論壇中，直接把聽來的東西，就做了轉述呢？
How could you repost this information on Foreign Land?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I didn’t quote others and post the concerns as accusations. Instead, all my comments were questions. I was hoping Winwin would provide some sort of clarifications so that the foreign community would not hold any wrong ideas against that company.
我沒有直接引用，我只是發表言論、提出我的問題。我只是希望贏贏公司可以釐清這些問題，讓外國人不會對這家公司有誤解。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'foreign community' in their translation.

什麼叫做你都是用問題的方式來進行批評？可以解釋一下嗎？
What do you mean that you criticize in questions? Can you explain it?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

For example, I asked in one posting “Is it true that Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC, the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally?”.
舉例來說，我發表了一個問題，就是那個公司有沒有幫外國人申請居留證，外國人可以合法居留嗎?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text asks if Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees apply for an ARC, while the user's translation asks if the company helps foreign people apply for a residence permit.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of Winwin as the subject of the question, which is an important detail in the original text.

所以你發表這一系列文章的目的只是為了釐清所謂的「真相」，是嗎？
So, you posted a series of comments just in order to find out the truth?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I only wanted to get some clarifications or explanations. However, instead of responding to my questions directly, Winwin chose to file this lawsuit against me.
是的，我只是想要得到一些澄清和解釋。然而，這個公司沒有直接回答我的問題，而是對我提出告訴。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail that the lawsuit was filed by the company.
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation does not convey the formal and legal nature of the lawsuit, which is important in the context.

雖然告訴人有提供他們自外國園地抓下來文章內容，但他們也告訴檢方，這些內容並不完整。所以就你記憶所及，你大概連續發表了幾篇呢？
Although the accuser provided some comments from Foreign Land and told the police, but the content wasn’t entire. …
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the important detail that the accuser provided comments from Foreign Land.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect. It should be 'Although the accuser told the police and provided some comments from Foreign Land, the content wasn't entire.'

As I stated before, it has been some time already. I cannot recall exactly how many articles I posted on Foreign Land, perhaps eight to ten? The problem is when this lawsuit began, the administrator of Foreign Land decided to delete my postings to avoid trouble.
我之前說過的，那些文章已經發表一段時間了，所以我不能明確告訴你我發了多少文章到論壇，也許是8到10篇。問題是當他們提出告訴後，版主就把我的文章全部刪除，以免造成麻煩。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the lawsuit in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the administrator's decision to delete the user's postings in order to avoid trouble.
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation lacks the appropriate level of formality and politeness compared to the original text.

你的意思是說當這個訴訟開始進行的時候，那個論壇的版主就進行了刪文的動作嗎？
You mean when the lawsuit began, the administrator of the forum deleted all of your posts, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yes, that is correct.
是這樣沒錯。

也就是說，你完全沒有辦法確定你一共為此事件發表過幾篇文章？
That is, you can’t assure how many comments you posted, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '確定' as 'assure' instead of 'confirm'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'posted' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

That’s correct, too.
這樣也沒錯。

那就你記憶所及，你曾經接到過該公司任何希望你停止批評他們的要求嗎？你有照做嗎？
Did you remember that the company asked you to stop criticizing? Did you stop posting comments?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I think towards the end of my postings, I did get a request from Winwin, asking me to stop posting articles about their company. I didn’t stop immediately because, again, I was only asking questions.
我認為如果要我停止發文的話，我應該會收到一些叫我停止發文的請求，我沒有立即停止，因為就像我前面所說的，我只是問問題而已。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

所以你還是堅持，因為你都是用問題的方式來發表評論，並沒有直接毀謗該公司名譽的事實，是嗎？
So, you mean you insist on posting comments in question, but not libeling the company, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

It was never my intention to defame Winwin. I don’t quite understand how a series of questions could possibly constitute “defamation.”
我從來都不是故意要毀謗這個公司，我不懂為什麼問問題會造成毀謗。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那請問告訴人，貴公司是什麼時候開始瞭解到，在「外國園地」當中，有關於貴公司的文章？
Now, I’m going to ask accuser some questions. Accuser, when do you realize that some comments are posted on Foreign Land about your company?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'When did you realize that some comments were posted on Foreign Land about your company?'

This issue first came to our attention around December 2019. My wife and I personally were not active in that kind of forums. We were only informed by some friends about the malicious comments on Foreign Land until then.
我第一次知道此事是在2019年12月。我和我老婆在這樣的論壇並不活躍。我們是在那時才被朋友告知有這些惡意評論。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'Foreign Land' in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

對於剛剛被告表示他只是提出一連串的問題，希望貴公司回答這些問題，並沒有以陳述方式毀謗貴公司的名譽。你有何意見？
According to the accused, he just posted a series of questions and hoped that the company can respond to him. He didn’t say something directly to defame your company. Did you have any opinion?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

That’s not true. In English, even when comments are made in the question format, they still carry enough force to make readers wonder or question the facts implied by the questions. Even when the defendant said he only asked questions, damage was done to my company.
這不是事實。在英文表達中，即使用問題方式評論，也能讓閱讀的人產生好奇或質疑事實。即使被告說他只是問問題，也足以毀謗我的公司。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'damage was done' is not accurately conveyed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The mention of 'comments' in the original text is omitted.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The tone of the original text is not accurately conveyed.

你的意思是說，不管對方是否用問題方式提出質疑，你們公司的名譽實際上都有所損害嗎？請解釋一下。
Do you meant that whether the other party posted the questions, the company has been defamed? Can you explain?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when the defendant asked those questions, it caused doubt and suspicion in the circle of foreigners in Taiwan. Foreigners form their own circle here in Taiwan and rumors travel fast. That’s why even the Labor Bureau paid several visits to our company, trying to find out if we were involved in the matters posted on Foreign Land.
是的。當被告問了這些問題，就能讓這些住在台灣的外國人懷疑這間公司。這些外國人在這個論壇裡自成一圈。在這圈子裡，謠言傳得非常快。這就是爲什麼勞工局多次造訪我的公司，來看這些評論中的問題是否真的存在。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'foreigners in Taiwan' as '住在台灣的外國人' is too literal and does not convey the meaning of 'foreigners forming their own circle in Taiwan'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'rumors travel fast' as '謠言傳得非常快' is too literal and does not convey the idiomatic meaning of rumors spreading quickly.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the Labor Bureau paying several visits to the company.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the matters being posted on Foreign Land.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The translation adds the phrase '來看這些評論中的問題是否真的存在' which is not present in the original text.

那勞工局前往貴公司瞭解外國人的雇用狀況，以及居留證的申請細節，有發現什麼不符合的地方嗎？
When the Labor Bureau went to the company to understand the situation of hiring the foreigner and their application of ARC, did anything happen which didn’t meet the requirements?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

No, the representatives from the Bureau came but did not find anything wrong with our company or our hiring practice.
沒有，勞工局派的代表並沒有查到任何不符規定的事。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果勞工局的調查並沒有發現什麼不妥之處，或是違法之處，再加上剛剛被告也解釋，他撰寫這些文章的目的都只是希望貴公司能夠進行自清的動作，有沒有可能雙方進行和解呢？
If the Labor Bureau didn’t find anything which is illegal or not appropriate, just like the accused explained that he wrote these articles only to hope that the company can clarify, can both parties consider settlement?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

We previously tried but failed to reach any conclusion. I would only consider settling this case with two things from the defendant. First, he has to formally apologize to Winwin for posting those inappropriate comments on Foreign Land. Second, as he said he heard all those details from “other foreign friends,” he should provide the names of those people to clear his own name.
我們之前有試著調解，但失敗了。我可以考慮和解，但對被告有兩件事的要求。第一，他必須為他不妥言論，正式向我的公司道歉。第二，如他剛才所說他是從其他外國朋友中聽到這些消息，他必須提供這些朋友的全名
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'Foreign Land' as the name of a platform or website. Instead, it is translated as '我的公司' (my company), which changes the meaning and context of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'Winwin' in the request for an apology, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'clear his own name' in the request for providing the names of the people who shared the details, which is an important detail in the original text.

被告，就像剛剛告訴人所指出，如果要進行和解，他希望由你這邊採取兩個行動，第一，正式道歉，對於在外國園地所發表的文章，不論你的文章是否造成告訴人公司實質上的名譽受損，對方都希望你提出道歉。第二，你剛剛前面指出，你是從一些外國友人那邊，聽到告訴人公司有違法對待外國勞工之嫌，你可以提供這些友人的姓名嗎？
The accused, just like accuser said, if you want a settlement, you need to take two actions. First, you need to apologize formally. For the comments you posted on Foreign Land, whether they constituted defamation, you need to apologize. Second, you have mentioned that you heard these things from your foreign friend. The company treated the employees illegally. Can you provide the names of your friends?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'just like accuser said' should be 'just like the accuser said'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of what the accused said that led to the accusation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the accusations against the accused.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the actions the accused needs to take for a settlement.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the accusations against the company regarding the treatment of foreign workers.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the request for the names of the accused's foreign friends.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the accused's response to the request for the names of their foreign friends.

No, I would not consider these terms. First of all, I don’t know why I should apologize for posting some questions on the Internet. Since when is asking questions a crime? Second, Winwin cannot agree to settle the case with the term of obtaining names from me. This is not right.
不，我拒絕接受這些條件。第一點，我不懂為什麼我要為這些言論道歉，什麼時候問問題也犯法？第二，他不應該要我公開這些外國朋友的全名。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'posting some questions on the Internet' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '什麼時候問問題也犯法？' (When is asking questions a crime?) in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'obtaining names from me' as '我公開這些外國朋友的全名' (publicly disclosing the full names of these foreign friends), which does not accurately convey the original meaning.

如果被告堅持因為文章的書寫內容都是以問題的方式進行，並沒有要毀謗告訴人公司的意圖，這顯然在第一個部分，你就是拒絕道歉，是嗎？
The accused, you insist that you wrote the comments in questions, and you didn’t intend to defame the company, so you won’t apologize, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

No, I will not consider making an apology.
對，我拒絕道歉。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

對於告訴人的第二個要求，你也拒絕。是因為擔心告訴人公司會對那些人進行相關的法律訴訟，是嗎？
You also reject the second condition. Is that because you afraid that the company will file a lawsuit against your foreign friends?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

The thing is that some of the friends used to or may be currently working for Winwin. How could I jeopardize them just for the sake of settling my own case? Why should they suffer the potential harm?
我擔心那些曾在那邊工作或是目前在那工作的朋友受害。我怎麼可以出賣這些朋友，就因為我想達成和解？為什麼他們要遭到這些傷害？
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'jeopardize' and 'suffer the potential harm'.

如果雙方無法就和解進行任何退讓，那麼法院這邊只能將這一次的準備程序內容進行彙整，以便進行下一次的審理程序。雙方的辯護人，是不是能夠針對和解這個選擇，再跟你們的當事人談一談呢？
The accuser, if both parties cannot reach a settlement, the court will collect the details for preparatory procedure and have next trial procedure. Today both parties have their lawyers. The lawyers of both parties, can you negotiate with your clients about settlement?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant or the accused party in their translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'is' instead of 'are' to agree with the plural subject 'lawyers'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions the possibility of the lawyers discussing settlement with their clients, while the user's translation suggests that the lawyers can negotiate with each other about settlement.

報告庭上，其實之前我們就有跟被告溝通，既然他說他的消息都是聽自其他友人，他大可以直接把那些人的名字提供給我們，而讓這一次的訴訟事件告一段落，但被告的態度一直很不合作，所以我們這邊也就無法進行進一步的和解動作。
Dear judge, I am the lawyer of the accuser. We used to negotiate with the defendant. The defendant said he heard information from his friends. He can provide their full names, so this case will be dismissed here. However, the defendant didn’t want to cooperate so we couldn’t reach an agreement.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the lawyer is reporting in court.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'didn’t want' instead of 'doesn’t want'.

報告鈞院，其實我的當事人會有這樣的顧慮，最主要是因為告訴人公司雇用很多外國人士，我的當事人不希望因為提供友人姓名一事，而讓過去或目前為告訴人公司服務的外國人士，惹上不必要的麻煩。望請鈞院了解。
Dear judge, I am the lawyer of the accused. The reason why my client has these concerns is because the accuser’s company applies many foreign employees. My client doesn’t want to provide the names of his foreign friends because he doesn’t want his friends to get into trouble. Hope you can understand.

既然告訴人跟被告雙方對於和解都各自有堅持，本庭定中華民國109年8月14日上午11點整進行審理程序。
Because both parties don’t reach a settlement, so the date of the trial procedure will set at 11 a.m. on August 14, 2020.

 請問被告，有無需要法院進一步調查之證據？
The defendant, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, your honor.
沒有，親愛的法官大人。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那告訴人這邊呢？
The accuser, do you have any evidence you hope the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the part about asking the accuser to provide evidence.

I will think about it. If anything comes up, I will ask my lawyer to place a request to the court.
如果我有想到任何問題，我會請律師告知庭上。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我會請律師向法庭提出請求。'

那針對下一次的庭期，我們就不再發傳票，而是直接在庭直接以橘色小卡進行通知。請在簽完今天的筆錄後，領取小卡，再行離開。
About the next court date, we will not issue the subpoena. We will give you orange cards to inform you. Please sign your statement… The court is dismissed today.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'Please sign your statement… The court is dismissed today.' is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'The court is dismissed today. Please sign your statement.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the instruction for the defendant to collect the orange cards before leaving.

請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
Prosecutor, please state the details of the crime.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'Prosecutor' at the beginning of the sentence, which is an important detail in the original text.

如起訴書所載。
As stated in the indictment.

被告因妨害名譽案件被檢察官起訴，起因是被告涉嫌在中華民國108年12月1日到109年1月20日之間，在網際網路論壇，名為Foreign Land (外國園地)，發表一連串的評論，雖此論壇之主要目的是提供在台居留外國人士交流之平台，但被告卻利用這樣一個平台進行對告訴人公司之批評，致使告訴人公司名譽受損。對此妨害名譽之告訴，有何辯解？
The defendant, you are prosecuted for defamation. The reason is because during umm… December 1st, 2019 to January 20th, 2020, you posted a thread of comments on the social media on the Internet called Foreign Land. This platform’s intention is to let foreigners who live in Taiwan to communicate with each other, but you used this platform to criticize the accuser’s company, and defamed the company. And damaged the company’s reputation. As for the defamation crime, what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'The defendant, you are prosecuted for defamation' is incorrect. It should be 'You, the defendant, are prosecuted for defamation.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of '被告' as 'The defendant' is incorrect. It should be translated as 'The accused' or 'The defendant'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the specific details of the defamation case, such as the content of the comments and the extent of the damage to the company's reputation.

I plead not guilty.
我沒有罪。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'plead' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I plead not guilty.'

請問你知道「外國園地」這個論壇嗎？
Defendant, do you know the internet platform Foreign Land?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外國園地' as 'Foreign Land' instead of 'Foreign Forum'.

Yes, Foreign Land is a forum very popular among foreigners.
我知道，因為外國園地在外國人…在我們外國人之間是很受歡迎的論壇。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

可以簡要的描述你在這個平台上的活動嗎？
Can you briefly your activities on this platform?

I am a registered member, which means I can read others’ posts and post articles for others to read.
我是有註冊的會員，就是我可以看別人的文章，我也可以發布文章讓其他人看。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我是有註冊的會員'.

你常常在上面發表文章嗎，可以大概抓個頻率嗎，大概多久發表一篇文章？
So, do you often post comments on this platform

I won’t say I regularly post articles on Foreign Land. I only have postings when I want to share some concerns or vent my feelings.
我不會說我常常在上面發文，我只有在..我只有在我關心的事情或我想要抒發情緒的時候才會發。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我只有在我關心的事情或我想要抒發情緒的時候才會發。'

提示偵券(一)65頁。這一頁是取自中華民國108年12月13日在「外國園地」中發表的內容。請你看一下，這是你寫的嗎？
Next, I am going to inform the investigatory paper number 1 page 65. This page is from the comments on Foreign Land December 13th, 2019. Is this the comments you posted?

It seems to be my posting but it was posted some time ago, I am not sure if the article is in its entirety.
這個看起來像是我發的，但是在很久以前，所以我也沒有辦法確定文章的完整度。

你在文中所提到的主要內容為何？請陳述。
Please state what you posted… the content of what you posted.

As you can see from the copy, I posted some concerns and questions regarding Winwin company, especially about how foreigners were treated by that company.
就像你所看到的一樣，我..我發表了 對於文文公司的問題，然後揭露外國人在這家公司是怎麼被對待的。
semantic conversion	word choice errors	The word 'concerns' is translated as '問題' which means 'problems' instead of '關注' which means 'concerns'.
semantic conversion	word choice errors	The word 'questions' is translated as '問題' which means 'problems' instead of '問題' which means 'questions'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'how foreigners were treated' is translated as '外國人在這家公司是怎麼被對待的' which means 'how foreigners were treated in this company' instead of '外國人在這家公司是怎麼對待的' which means 'how foreigners were treated by this company'.

你剛剛講到的某一公司，請問有在任何一篇文章當中，明確指出該公司的全名嗎？
You have mentioned the company’s name. Do you remember if you have posted the full name of the company in any of your posts?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the full name of the company in their translation.

Yes, I am sure I have used the company’s full name, Winwin.
恩對阿，我有用公司的本名，文文。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'Winwin' as '文文', which is not the correct translation.

你在65頁的內容中，提到該公司常常在雇用外國人時，沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利，更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況。請問，你這樣講，有證據嗎？
As stated in page 65, you stated that this company when hiring foreigners, they didn’t follow the Basic Labor Law of paying basic wage, and the time and rights. And you also mentioned that the company didn’t apply for foreigner’s visa, is this true?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

I did mention those issues. I did not have evidence. I heard those issues from some other foreign friends who either worked for that company or had experiences with that company. As a result, I expressed my concerns in the question format, meaning I asked all those questions regarding working hours, basic salary, benefits and ARC application with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions.
我的確有聽到這些問題，但我沒有證據。我是從曾經在那家公司工作過的外國人那邊聽到這些消息的。因此我發表了我的意見…我用問的方式發表我的意見，其中提到了這個公司的基本工時、工資還有居留證的問題，希望文文公司可以….看到並且改善。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of expressing concerns in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a different word order compared to the original text.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'expressed my concerns' in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions' in the original text.

你的意思是說，你是從其他外國朋友那邊聽到這些細節，但不是本人的第一手資料，是嗎？
Do you mean that you heard this from foreigner friends and this information is not first hand?

True. I heard those details from other friends, also the registered members of Foreign Land.
沒錯，我是從朋友那邊聽來的，還有論壇上註冊的會員他們也這麼說。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user translated 'Foreign Land' as '論壇' (forum) instead of the intended meaning of a specific organization or group.

那你怎麼可以在一個公開的論壇中，直接把聽來的東西，就做了轉述呢？
Then how can you… how can you post these comments on a public platform which is not first hand information?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the phrase '直接把聽來的東西' which means 'directly paraphrasing what you heard'.

I didn’t quote others and post the concerns as accusations. Instead, all my comments were questions. I was hoping Winwin would provide some sort of clarifications so that the foreign community would not hold any wrong ideas against that company.
我並沒有直接的….ㄟ…直接控告他所做的事情，我都用詢問的方式。我希望文文公司他們可以澄清這些不好的訊息，這樣子外國人也不會對他有不好的印象。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of not quoting others and posting concerns as accusations.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of all comments being questions.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of hoping for clarifications from Winwin.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the foreign community holding wrong ideas against the company.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of wanting to prevent the foreign community from having a negative impression of the company.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the company's name, Winwin.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the concerns being posted as accusations.

什麼叫做你都是用問題的方式來進行批評？可以解釋一下嗎？
What do you mean by you criticized by asking questions? Can you explain this?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

For example, I asked in one posting “Is it true that Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC, the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally?”.
舉例來說，我說文文公司他沒有幫外國人申請居留證……也就是在台灣工作的……..
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The user translated 'Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC' as '文文公司他沒有幫外國人申請居留證', which means 'Winwin does not help foreign people apply for a residence permit'. However, the original text mentions 'the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally', which refers to an ARC (Alien Resident Certificate), not a general residence permit.

所以你發表這一系列文章的目的只是為了釐清所謂的「真相」，是嗎？
So, the intention of you posting these comments is just to find out the truth?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '釐清所謂的「真相」' as 'find out the truth', which does not accurately convey the meaning of '釐清' (clarify).

Yes, I only wanted to get some clarifications or explanations. However, instead of responding to my questions directly, Winwin chose to file this lawsuit against me.
是的，我只是希望他可以澄清並且給大家一個交代。然而，文文公司不但沒有直接回答我的問題，反而是對我提起訴訟。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'file this lawsuit against me' is translated as '對我提起訴訟' which means 'file a lawsuit against me' instead of 'file this lawsuit against me'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important detail of the speaker wanting clarification or explanations from Winwin.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds the unnecessary information of '給大家一個交代' which means 'give everyone an explanation'. This information is not present in the original text.

雖然告訴人有提供他們自外國園地抓下來文章內容，但他們也告訴檢方，這些內容並不完整。所以就你記憶所及，你大概連續發表了幾篇呢？
Although the accuser provided some comments from Foreign Land, they have said that these comments are not a whole. How many posts did you post on this platform?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the platform being discussed in the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'posted' before the subject 'you', resulting in incorrect word order.

As I stated before, it has been some time already. I cannot recall exactly how many articles I posted on Foreign Land, perhaps eight to ten? The problem is when this lawsuit began, the administrator of Foreign Land decided to delete my postings to avoid trouble.
 就像我說過的，我偶爾會發，但是我沒有辦法確切記得我到底發了幾篇，我想大概是在8~10篇的範圍內，問題是當文文公司提起訴訟的時候，外國園地的版主決定刪掉我寫的那些文章來避免麻煩。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'Foreign Land' as '外國園地' which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original term.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the administrator deleting the postings to avoid trouble.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user translated 'Foreign Land' as '外國園地' which may not accurately represent the cultural connotations of the original term.

你的意思是說當這個訴訟開始進行的時候，那個論壇的版主就進行了刪文的動作嗎？
Do you mean after the lawsuit was filed, the administrator of Foreign Land just deleted all the posts?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using 'Foreign Land' instead of 'the forum'.

Yes, that is correct.
沒有錯。

也就是說，你完全沒有辦法確定你一共為此事件發表過幾篇文章？
This also means that you cannot be sure that you posted… how many comments you posted about this incident, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That’s correct, too.
恩，你說的沒錯。

那就你記憶所及，你曾經接到過該公司任何希望你停止批評他們的要求嗎？你有照做嗎？
As far as you can remember, did the company tell you to stop your comments? And did you do so?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I think towards the end of my postings, I did get a request from Winwin, asking me to stop posting articles about their company. I didn’t stop immediately because, again, I was only asking questions.
沒錯，文文公司確實有要求我停止再發布這些文章，但我並沒有馬上停止這麼做，就像我說過的阿，我只是問問題而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of Winwin's request to stop posting articles about their company.

所以你還是堅持，因為你都是用問題的方式來發表評論，並沒有直接毀謗該公司名譽的事實，是嗎？
So, the defendant, you mean you only criticized the company by asking questions and do not admit that you libeled the company, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by introducing the concept of libel, which is not mentioned in the original text.

It was never my intention to defame Winwin. I don’t quite understand how a series of questions could possibly constitute “defamation.”
妨害文文公司的名譽從來不是我的目的，我真的不能理解這些我問的問題會構成妨害名譽
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	妨害名譽 (defamation) translated as 妨害文文公司的名譽 (defamation of Winwin's reputation)

那請問告訴人，貴公司是什麼時候開始瞭解到，在「外國園地」當中，有關於貴公司的文章？
Then I am going to ask the accuser some questions. So, the accuser, when do you realize that the accused post some articles on the Foreign Land about your company?

This issue first came to our attention around December 2019. My wife and I personally were not active in that kind of forums. We were only informed by some friends about the malicious comments on Foreign Land until then.
這個事件，我們公司第一次注意到這件事是在2019年的12月。我和我的老婆並沒有在那個論壇裡面很活躍。我們當時是被朋友告知有這些惡意的言論在該論壇上。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

對於剛剛被告表示他只是提出一連串的問題，希望貴公司回答這些問題，並沒有以陳述方式毀謗貴公司的名譽。你有何意見？
Just.. as what the accused mentioned, he said that he just… he just post the article by asking questions instead of statement… instead of…instead of post the article in the form of statement.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

That’s not true. In English, even when comments are made in the question format, they still carry enough force to make readers wonder or question the facts implied by the questions. Even when the defendant said he only asked questions, damage was done to my company.
在英文裡面，即使是問問題的形式，文字也有足夠的力量可以讓閱讀的人覺得或懷疑那些事實。所以當被告說他用問問題的方式，也足以妨害我們公司的名譽。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你的意思是說，不管對方是否用問題方式提出質疑，你們公司的名譽實際上都有所損害嗎？請解釋一下。
Do you mean that, no matter…whether the accused use the …use the …the accused use …asking question form. Your …still be damage….
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect, resulting in a confusing and unclear sentence structure.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original text.

Yes, when the defendant asked those questions, it caused doubt and suspicion in the circle of foreigners in Taiwan. Foreigners form their own circle here in Taiwan and rumors travel fast. That’s why even the Labor Bureau paid several visits to our company, trying to find out if we were involved in the matters posted on Foreign Land.
是的，當被告她提出這些疑問的時候就在我們外國人的圈子裡面造成非常大的懷疑和不信任。外國人在台灣有自己的圈子，然後在這個圈子裏面有很多流言和消息都傳得很快。這就是為什麼台灣的勞工局多次造訪我們，也想要知道我們是否有捲進這起事件裡面。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'defendant' as '被告她' is incorrect. It should be translated as '被告' without specifying the gender.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '當被告她提出這些疑問的時候' is incorrect. It should be '當被告提出這些疑問的時候'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the Labor Bureau paying several visits to the company.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the matters being posted on Foreign Land.

那勞工局前往貴公司瞭解外國人的雇用狀況，以及居留證的申請細節，有發現什麼不符合的地方嗎？
So when the Labor Bureau come to your company, do they found out that your…the hiring conditions, ARC application is not reasonable?

No, the representatives from the Bureau came but did not find anything wrong with our company or our hiring practice.
沒有，當勞工局的代表來的時候，他們沒有發現任何的問題。僱人方面也沒有任何問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '沒有任何的問題' instead of '任何的問題沒有'.

如果勞工局的調查並沒有發現什麼不妥之處，或是違法之處，再加上剛剛被告也解釋，他撰寫這些文章的目的都只是希望貴公司能夠進行自清的動作，有沒有可能雙方進行和解呢？
So if the…if your hiring conditions and ARC application is…are nothing wrong. And the accused just hope that you can give a self-clarification. So will you consider to settle with him
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

We previously tried but failed to reach any conclusion. I would only consider settling this case with two things from the defendant. First, he has to formally apologize to Winwin for posting those inappropriate comments on Foreign Land. Second, as he said he heard all those details from “other foreign friends,” he should provide the names of those people to clear his own name.
我們之前已經嘗試過和解了，但我們沒有達到任何的協議。要我跟被告人進行和解，我有兩個條件。第一，他必須對文文公司提出非常的道歉。第二，他說他都是從其他外國朋友得知這些消息，所以他想要自清的話就需要提供這些人的全名。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

被告，就像剛剛告訴人所指出，如果要進行和解，他希望由你這邊採取兩個行動，第一，正式道歉，對於在外國園地所發表的文章，不論你的文章是否造成告訴人公司實質上的名譽受損，對方都希望你提出道歉。第二，你剛剛前面指出，你是從一些外國友人那邊，聽到告訴人公司有違法對待外國勞工之嫌，你可以提供這些友人的姓名嗎？
The accused, just as what the accuser said, if you wan to settle, you need to take two actions that he requested. First, you need to apologize formally. According to your article, no matter…no matter the company…the company’s reputation was damaged, you need to apologize to them. Second, you said that you heard your friends tell you that the company…the company is illegal of the hiring rules. Can you provide those people’s name?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of critical context in the translation

No, I would not consider these terms. First of all, I don’t know why I should apologize for posting some questions on the Internet. Since when is asking questions a crime? Second, Winwin cannot agree to settle the case with the term of obtaining names from me. This is not right.
不，我拒絕接受這兩個條件。第一，我不知道為什麼我只是發表一些評論就要道歉。從什麼時候開始問問題是一種罪? 第二，文文公司想要進行和解的方式是要公開我外國朋友的全名，我覺得這樣不合理。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '不，我拒絕接受這兩個條件' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我拒絕接受這兩個條件，不。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'posting some questions on the Internet' as '發表一些評論' is incorrect. The correct translation should be '在網上發表一些問題'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'asking questions' as '問問題' is correct, but the phrase '從什麼時候開始問問題是一種罪?' is not an accurate representation of the original meaning. It should be translated as '從什麼時候開始問問題變成了犯罪?' to convey the intended meaning.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'settle the case' as '進行和解的方式' is correct, but the phrase '要公開我外國朋友的全名' is not an accurate representation of the original meaning. It should be translated as '要求我提供我外國朋友的全名' to convey the intended meaning.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我覺得這樣不合理' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '這樣我覺得不合理'.

如果被告堅持因為文章的書寫內容都是以問題的方式進行，並沒有要毀謗告訴人公司的意圖，這顯然在第一個部分，你就是拒絕道歉，是嗎？
The defendant, the accused, you insist that you just asking questions instead of Libel, so you refuse to apologize, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by using the term 'Libel' instead of '毀謗' (defamation).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order in the sentence 'The defendant, the accused, you insist that you just asking questions instead of Libel'.

No, I will not consider making an apology.
對，我拒絕道歉。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對於告訴人的第二個要求，你也拒絕。是因為擔心告訴人公司會對那些人進行相關的法律訴訟，是嗎？
The reason why you refuse the second condition is because you afraid that the accuser will take a legal action against those foreign friends, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

The thing is that some of the friends used to or may be currently working for Winwin. How could I jeopardize them just for the sake of settling my own case? Why should they suffer the potential harm?
我擔心的是因為目前有人曾經或現在都還在文文公司工作。我怎麼可以出賣他們，就為了這個案子? 為什麼他們必須受到波及呢?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我怎麼可以為了這個案子出賣他們?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	There is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. The correct verb form should be '受到波及' instead of '受到波及呢'.

如果雙方無法就和解進行任何退讓，那麼法院這邊只能將這一次的準備程序內容進行彙整，以便進行下一次的審理程序。雙方的辯護人，是不是能夠針對和解這個選擇，再跟你們的當事人談一談呢？
The accuser…if the both parties cannot settle, we will consider…we will consider to…collect the information of this court and…have the next court. Today the both parties have their lawyers, so the lawyer of both parties, can you talk to your…clients about settlement?
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in sentence structure
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of important details in translation

報告庭上，其實之前我們就有跟被告溝通，既然他說他的消息都是聽自其他友人，他大可以直接把那些人的名字提供給我們，而讓這一次的訴訟事件告一段落，但被告的態度一直很不合作，所以我們這邊也就無法進行進一步的和解動作。
Your honor, I am the accuser’s lawyer. Your honor, we have actually negotiated with the accused. As he said, he only heard all these information from his foreigner friends, he could just provide the full names of these friends and the case would be closed. But the defendant is very uncooperative, so we cannot take a further step to settle this case.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Your honor, I am the lawyer of the accuser.'
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information about negotiating with the accused and the accused hearing the information from his friends.
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	The user added the phrase 'Your honor' multiple times, which is not present in the original text.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user added the phrase 'foreigner friends', which is not mentioned in the original text.

報告鈞院，其實我的當事人會有這樣的顧慮，最主要是因為告訴人公司雇用很多外國人士，我的當事人不希望因為提供友人姓名一事，而讓過去或目前為告訴人公司服務的外國人士，惹上不必要的麻煩。望請鈞院了解。
Your honor, I’m the accused’s lawyer. The reason why my client is concerned is because there are many foreigners work in the company. My client didn’t…my client isn’t willing to provide his friends’ name just because he didn’t want those foreigners work in the company get into troubles. Please understand.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the accused's concern about providing his friends' names.

既然告訴人跟被告雙方對於和解都各自有堅持，本庭定中華民國109年8月14日上午11點整進行審理程序。
Since both parties have their own concerns and stances, the next court will be set at 11 o’clock on August 14th 2020. We will have a trial procedure
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the parties' insistence on reconciliation.

 請問被告，有無需要法院進一步調查之證據？
The accused, do you have evidence that need the court to help you investigate?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, your honor.
沒有。

那告訴人這邊呢？
How about the accuser? Are there any evidence you want the court to investigate?

Saying as in the indictment.

被告因妨害名譽案件被檢察官起訴，起因是被告涉嫌在中華民國108年12月1日到109年1月20日之間，在網際網路論壇，名為Foreign Land (外國園地)，發表一連串的評論，雖此論壇之主要目的是提供在台居留外國人士交流之平台，但被告卻利用這樣一個平台進行對告訴人公司之批評，致使告訴人公司名譽受損。對此妨害名譽之告訴，有何辯解？
The defendant, you are prosecuted of violating an internet defamation. On December 1, 2019 to January 20, 2020, you were at an internet chatroom and you posted some comments. Although the purpose of this platform is to let some foreigners staying in Taiwan to exchange their thoughts. However, you posted some comments to criticize the accuser’s company, to damage the accuser’s reputation. What’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'On December 1, 2019 to January 20, 2020, you were at an internet chatroom and you posted some comments.' The correct word order should be 'You were at an internet chatroom and posted some comments from December 1, 2019 to January 20, 2020.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '被告' as 'defendant' instead of 'accused'. The correct translation should be 'accused' as '被告' refers to the person who is accused in a legal case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the accused's comments were made on a forum called 'Foreign Land'. This detail is important for understanding the context of the case.

I plead not guilty.
我沒有罪。
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'plead' should agree with the subject 'I', so it should be 'I plead not guilty.'

請問你知道「外國園地」這個論壇嗎？
I’m going to inquire the accused.The accused, do you know the forum of “Foreign Land”?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '外國園地' as 'Foreign Land' instead of 'Foreign Forum'.

Yes, Foreign Land is a forum very popular among foreigners.
對啊，因為外國園地在外國人間是很受歡迎的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

可以簡要的描述你在這個平台上的活動嗎？

How often do you post a feed?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'feed' in the translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'feed' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'post'.

I won’t say I regularly post articles on Foreign Land. I only have postings when I want to share some concerns or vent my feelings.
我不會說我有一個發文的頻率。我只在我關心些議題或想抒發感受的時候才會發文。

提示偵券(一)65頁。這一頁是取自中華民國108年12月13日在「外國園地」中發表的內容。請你看一下，這是你寫的嗎？
Now I’m going to read the investigation procedure page 65.This page describes a content from Foreign Land on December 13, 2019. Is this post written by you?

It seems to be my posting but it was posted some time ago, I am not sure if the article is in its entirety.
這篇好像是我寫的但是因為已經是一段時間以前的了，所以我不太確定這篇的完整性。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user is unsure if the article is complete or not.

你在文中所提到的主要內容為何？請陳述。
Could you please state the main idea to the court?

As you can see from the copy, I posted some concerns and questions regarding Winwin company, especially about how foreigners were treated by that company.
就像你們可以看到的這篇貼文，我在上頭寫了一些我的疑慮以及問題，關於雙贏這個公司它們是怎麼對待外國人的。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text and includes inappropriate cultural transformation.

你剛剛講到的某一公司，請問有在任何一篇文章當中，明確指出該公司的全名嗎？
You just mention company’s name, and did you state clearly of the company’s full name on any posts?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the company's full name in the translation.

Yes, I am sure I have used the company’s full name, Winwin.
是的，我很確定我有用雙贏公司的全名。

你在65頁的內容中，提到該公司常常在雇用外國人時，沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利，更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況。請問，你這樣講，有證據嗎？
You mentioned in page 65 that when the company is hiring a foreigner, they often violate the Basic Labor Law, the basic labor hour, and wage and welfare.Moreover, you mention that, from time to time when the company isn’t applying the working VISA for the foreign, do you have any evidence regarding this?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利' as 'they often violate the Basic Labor Law, the basic labor hour, and wage and welfare'. The correct translation should be 'they often fail to provide the basic working hours, wages, and benefits as stipulated by the Labor Standards Act.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translates '更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況' as 'Moreover, you mention that, from time to time when the company isn’t applying the working VISA for the foreign'. The correct translation should be 'Moreover, there are instances where they fail to apply for work visas for foreign employees.'

I did mention those issues. I did not have evidence. I heard those issues from some other foreign friends who either worked for that company or had experiences with that company. As a result, I expressed my concerns in the question format, meaning I asked all those questions regarding working hours, basic salary, benefits and ARC application with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions.
我有提到這件事情但我還沒有證據。我有從一些外國朋友口中聽說，而那些朋友都是在公司工作或是和那些人交手過的。所以我用問問題的方式來表達我的想法，我的意思是我的問題都是有關勞基法、基本工時、基本薪資以及福利，以及雙贏公司是怎麼對外國居留證申請的方式，所以我希望他們可以出面澄清這個問題。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是說，你是從其他外國朋友那邊聽到這些細節，但不是本人的第一手資料，是嗎？
So you mean that you obtain this information from other friends, and these details are not firsthand information, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

True. I heard those details from other friends, also the registered members of Foreign Land.
沒錯我就是從其他外國朋友那邊聽來的，以及從外國園地的註冊會員。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of 'registered members of Foreign Land'.

那你怎麼可以在一個公開的論壇中，直接把聽來的東西，就做了轉述呢？
So how can you in such public forum and directly state what you have heard on the post?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

I didn’t quote others and post the concerns as accusations. Instead, all my comments were questions. I was hoping Winwin would provide some sort of clarifications so that the foreign community would not hold any wrong ideas against that company.
我並沒有引述其他人說的話在我的貼文當中，也不是控告的形式，我只是用問題的方式呈現。我只是希望雙贏公司可以提供某些形式的澄清，所以在我們的社群當中，才不會給外國人有錯誤的印象。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'comments' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user did not convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness in the translation. The original text mentions 'foreign community' and 'that company', which suggests a formal and polite tone. However, the user's translation does not reflect this.

什麼叫做你都是用問題的方式來進行批評？可以解釋一下嗎？
What do you mean by asking questions? Could you explain further?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

For example, I asked in one posting “Is it true that Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC, the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally?”.
舉例來說，我曾在一篇貼文問說，雙贏公司是否真的沒有幫助外國人申請居留證，也就是他們可以合法在台工作的權利。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'Winwin' as '雙贏公司' which is a specific company name, but the original text refers to 'Winwin' as a general concept or practice.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'foreign employees' in their translation, which is a crucial detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'ARC' (Alien Resident Certificate) in their translation, which is a key term in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'legally' in their translation, which is an important qualifier in the original text.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user translated 'ARC' as '居留證' which is a direct translation, but the idiomatic expression 'ARC' is commonly used in English to refer to the specific legal working permit in Taiwan.

所以你發表這一系列文章的目的只是為了釐清所謂的「真相」，是嗎？
So your purposes of this post are finding out the truth, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '釐清所謂的「真相」' as 'finding out the truth', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, I only wanted to get some clarifications or explanations. However, instead of responding to my questions directly, Winwin chose to file this lawsuit against me.
是的，我只想要得到他們的澄清或解釋。然而，他們並沒有直接的回應我，雙贏公司選擇了控告我的方式。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'file this lawsuit against me' is translated as '控告我的方式' which means 'the way of accusing me' instead of 'file this lawsuit against me'.

雖然告訴人有提供他們自外國園地抓下來文章內容，但他們也告訴檢方，這些內容並不完整。所以就你記憶所及，你大概連續發表了幾篇呢？
Although the accuser provide some articles contents, they have informed that these informations are not complete. How many post have you posts?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How many posts have you posted?'

As I stated before, it has been some time already. I cannot recall exactly how many articles I posted on Foreign Land, perhaps eight to ten? The problem is when this lawsuit began, the administrator of Foreign Land decided to delete my postings to avoid trouble.
就像我之前說過的，這些貼文已經有段時間了，就我記憶所及，大概只能想起來我大概發了8到10篇。問題是，當他們對我提出告訴時，版主就會刪除這些文章來避免不必要的麻煩。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the reason for deleting the postings, which is to avoid trouble.

你的意思是說當這個訴訟開始進行的時候，那個論壇的版主就進行了刪文的動作嗎？
What you meant was when the lawsuit came to effect, the administrator will delete all the post?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of the sentence.

Yes, that is correct.
沒錯。

也就是說，你完全沒有辦法確定你一共為此事件發表過幾篇文章？
That is you still aren’t that sure how many post you have posted upon this issue?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

That’s correct, too.
也沒錯。

那就你記憶所及，你曾經接到過該公司任何希望你停止批評他們的要求嗎？你有照做嗎？
In your memory, did the company send you any requirement or warning to stop posting?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I think towards the end of my postings, I did get a request from Winwin, asking me to stop posting articles about their company. I didn’t stop immediately because, again, I was only asking questions.
在我停止發文之前，都沒有收到任何要我停止發文的消息。我沒有立即停止發文，因為就像我之前所說的，我只是在問問題而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of receiving a request from Winwin to stop posting articles about their company.

所以你還是堅持，因為你都是用問題的方式來發表評論，並沒有直接毀謗該公司名譽的事實，是嗎？
So the defendant, you still insist that you are posting in the form of posting questions, instead of directly libeling the company to damage their reputation. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

It was never my intention to defame Winwin. I don’t quite understand how a series of questions could possibly constitute “defamation.”
我從來就沒有想過要妨害雙贏公司的名譽。我還是不太了解一連串的問題會構成妨害名譽或毀謗。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那請問告訴人，貴公司是什麼時候開始瞭解到，在「外國園地」當中，有關於貴公司的文章？
Next I will ask the plaintiff some questions. Plaintiff, when did you find that there are some comments about your company?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'foreign' in the phrase 'foreign field'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'Next I will ask the plaintiff some questions' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the original text.

This issue first came to our attention around December 2019. My wife and I personally were not active in that kind of forums. We were only informed by some friends about the malicious comments on Foreign Land until then.
這些問題主要首次是在2019年12月我們有意識到。我跟我老婆一開始並沒有在這個論壇上很活躍。我們是在朋友跟我們告知有這些惡意的評論之後才意識到這件事情。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'Foreign Land'.

對於剛剛被告表示他只是提出一連串的問題，希望貴公司回答這些問題，並沒有以陳述方式毀謗貴公司的名譽。你有何意見？
The defendent said that he didn‘t he just wrote the comment in the form of asking questions instead of statements. About this, what’s your idea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

That’s not true. In English, even when comments are made in the question format, they still carry enough force to make readers wonder or question the facts implied by the questions. Even when the defendant said he only asked questions, damage was done to my company.
這不對。這在英文裡面，即使是用問題的形式，它也是有強力的作用去質疑事實。也就是說，當被告問了這些問題的時候，他對我們的公司就造成了毁謗、造成我們的名譽受損。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original meaning by using '毁謗' (slander) instead of 'damage'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the defendant's statement being in the form of questions.

你的意思是說，不管對方是否用問題方式提出質疑，你們公司的名譽實際上都有所損害嗎？請解釋一下。
Can you make a further explanation that no matter the defendant used the question or not, your company...the reputation of your company is still damaged?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, when the defendant asked those questions, it caused doubt and suspicion in the circle of foreigners in Taiwan. Foreigners form their own circle here in Taiwan and rumors travel fast. That’s why even the Labor Bureau paid several visits to our company, trying to find out if we were involved in the matters posted on Foreign Land.
沒錯，被告的確造成了一些質疑。公司的確受到損害了，因為這些謠言都已經傳遍了。台灣的勞工局也有來造訪我們，去試圖找出我們是否牽涉其中。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of 'doubt and suspicion' as 'damage' and 'rumors'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of foreigners forming their own circle in Taiwan.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the reference to the matters posted on Foreign Land.

那勞工局前往貴公司瞭解外國人的雇用狀況，以及居留證的申請細節，有發現什麼不符合的地方嗎？
So when Labor Bureau went to visit your company and asked you about the your hiring and applying for ARC, are there any violations of your rule?

No, the representatives from the Bureau came but did not find anything wrong with our company or our hiring practice.
沒有，他們有過來探視但沒有發現任何問題，在申請上面都沒有問題。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text and includes an inappropriate cultural transformation.

如果勞工局的調查並沒有發現什麼不妥之處，或是違法之處，再加上剛剛被告也解釋，他撰寫這些文章的目的都只是希望貴公司能夠進行自清的動作，有沒有可能雙方進行和解呢？
If the Labor Bureau did not find anything wrong in your company. Furthermore, the aim of the defendant’s asking your question is to want to get your self-clarification; as a result, is there any chance for you to make a settlement?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

被告，就像剛剛告訴人所指出，如果要進行和解，他希望由你這邊採取兩個行動，第一，正式道歉，對於在外國園地所發表的文章，不論你的文章是否造成告訴人公司實質上的名譽受損，對方都希望你提出道歉。第二，你剛剛前面指出，你是從一些外國友人那邊，聽到告訴人公司有違法對待外國勞工之嫌，你可以提供這些友人的姓名嗎？
Defendant, as the accuser required, if you want to reach a settlement, you have to take the following two actions...the above mentioned two actions. First, you have to apologize formally. Regarding your posts on the Foreign Land, no matter you had caused damage to their reputation... As you mentioned before, you have heard these rumors from your foreign friends, and could you please provide those friends’ names, since you are suspected of violating defamation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'the above mentioned two actions'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the specific details of how the defendant's posts may have caused damage to the accuser's company's reputation
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the specific details of how the defendant's posts may have caused damage to the accuser's company's reputation
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Regarding your posts on the Foreign Land'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of the specific details of the accusations against the defendant regarding the mistreatment of foreign workers
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the specific details of the accusations against the defendant regarding the mistreatment of foreign workers

No, I would not consider these terms. First of all, I don’t know why I should apologize for posting some questions on the Internet. Since when is asking questions a crime? Second, Winwin cannot agree to settle the case with the term of obtaining names from me. This is not right.
不，我不會考慮以上兩個方式。首先，我還是不懂為什麼我只是問一些問題就要受到處罰。從什麼時候開始問問題變成一種罪？第二，雙贏公司並不同意要和解，若是我提供這些人的姓名。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb should come before the subject.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The term 'crime' is not mentioned in the original text, but the user translates it as '罪' (crime).
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The term 'settle the case' is not mentioned in the original text, but the user translates it as '和解' (settle the case).

如果被告堅持因為文章的書寫內容都是以問題的方式進行，並沒有要毀謗告訴人公司的意圖，這顯然在第一個部分，你就是拒絕道歉，是嗎？
The defendant you insist that you are writing these posts in the form of asking questions, so you refuse to apologize, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the defendant refuses to apologize.

No, I will not consider making an apology.
不，我並不考慮要道歉。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

對於告訴人的第二個要求，你也拒絕。是因為擔心告訴人公司會對那些人進行相關的法律訴訟，是嗎？
As for the second request of the accuser, do you worry that your foreign friends will be filed a lawsuit against?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

The thing is that some of the friends used to or may be currently working for Winwin. How could I jeopardize them just for the sake of settling my own case? Why should they suffer the potential harm?
重點是，有些友人是曾經或是現在正在雙贏工作的。我怎麼忍心讓他們暴露在危險當中，只是為了要和解？為什麼他們要暴露在這些潛在的危險當中？
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

如果雙方無法就和解進行任何退讓，那麼法院這邊只能將這一次的準備程序內容進行彙整，以便進行下一次的審理程序。雙方的辯護人，是不是能夠針對和解這個選擇，再跟你們的當事人談一談呢？
The accuser if you don’t want to make any compromise against this settlement, we will gathering this information together to be the next court’s evidence. Today, the accuser and the defendant both have their lawyer. Regarding settlement, can both the lawyer talk to your client?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The accuser if you don’t want to make any compromise against this settlement'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'we will gathering this information together to be the next court’s evidence'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'so that' in the sentence: 'we will gathering this information together to be the next court’s evidence'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'to discuss' in the sentence: 'can both the lawyer talk to your client?'.

報告庭上，其實之前我們就有跟被告溝通，既然他說他的消息都是聽自其他友人，他大可以直接把那些人的名字提供給我們，而讓這一次的訴訟事件告一段落，但被告的態度一直很不合作，所以我們這邊也就無法進行進一步的和解動作。
Your Honor, I am the lawyer of the accuser. Your Honor, actually we have talked to the defendant before. Since the defendant obtained those details from his friends, Therefore, he can provide us the names of his friends and let the court to come to an end. However, the defendant is unwilling to cooperate with us, so the settlement cannot be made.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Since the defendant obtained those details from his friends, Therefore, he can provide us the names of his friends and let the court to come to an end.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of communication with the defendant in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant's attitude being uncooperative in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the inability to proceed with further reconciliation actions in the original text.

報告鈞院，其實我的當事人會有這樣的顧慮，最主要是因為告訴人公司雇用很多外國人士，我的當事人不希望因為提供友人姓名一事，而讓過去或目前為告訴人公司服務的外國人士，惹上不必要的麻煩。望請鈞院了解。
Your Honor, I’m the lawyer of the defendant. Actually, the concerns... the main concerns of my client is that your company has hired many of his friends. My client doesn’t hope to provide those names since those friends are...used to work in your company or currently work in your company, so he doesn’t want them to get into trouble. Your Honor, hope you can understand.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details about the defendant's concerns regarding providing the names of his friends who work or have worked in the company.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user made a subject-verb agreement error by using 'is' instead of 'are' when referring to the concerns of the defendant.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '鈞院' as 'Your Honor' instead of 'the court'.

既然告訴人跟被告雙方對於和解都各自有堅持，本庭定中華民國109年8月14日上午11點整進行審理程序。
Since that both parties are hold their own insistence, so we will set the next court, the trial procedure on at 11 AM on August 14, 2020.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

 請問被告，有無需要法院進一步調查之證據？
The dependent, do you need any further investigation, the court can help you.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

No, your honor.
不，沒有。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那告訴人這邊呢？

The defendant, you are prosecuted by the prosecutor that on March 8th 2020, on the door of a 7-11 at the intersection of Xuefu Rd and Daxue Rd you stole a motorcycle which had the plate number BL-1234. After the owner of the motorcycle reported the case to the police, the police found the motorcycle around Ganyuan Rd, Sec 1. After the police checked the CCTV clip…
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'on the door of a 7-11' is incorrect. It should be 'at the door of a 7-11'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'the police checked the CCTV clip' is not an accurate translation of '經警方調閱7-11門口監視器'. It should be 'the police reviewed the surveillance footage from the CCTV at the entrance of the 7-11'.

 I did not steal the motorcycle. On that day, it was rainy very hard. My friend and I did not bring an umbrella and we were in a hurry to get home. So, we decided to borrow the motorcycle. Our plan was to give it back, you know, we planned to put the motorbike back to the original place the second day. We didn’t mean to steal it at all.
我沒有偷那輛摩托車，那天，雨下得很大，我和我的朋友沒有帶傘，但是我們急著回家，所以我們決定「借用」一下那輛摩托車，我們有打算要還回去，真的，我們想說隔天把摩托車放回原來的地方，我們真的沒有要偷的意思。

No, but I was in a hurry to go home that day. My plane was leaving on the second day to go back to my country. I am really sorry. That was a terrible mistake.
不行，但那天下大雨而且我趕著回家，我回國的飛機在明天就會到達，我知道我犯了大錯，感到非常抱歉。

At that time, I just came out from the convenience store. It was raining and I saw that motorcycle. I realized the owner must have forgotten to take out the key. I thought I could use it briefly and bring it back soon.
那時，我剛從便利商店出來，我看到了那輛摩托車，發現車主應該是忘記拿走他的車鑰匙了，我想我可以稍微借用一下，再很快的還回來。

你的意思是那個摩托車的主人，忘了把鑰匙拿走嗎？

Yes, the key was left in the ignition, so I just rode the motorbike away.
是的，鑰匙還留在鑰匙孔裡，所以我就把它騎走了。

那你剛剛說，原來的計畫是要把車子還回去，那你有這樣做嗎？
You said that you planned to give the motorcycle back, so at last, did you do so?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

After we rode the bike away, I first gave my friend a ride home. Then I went back to my apartment. I was very tired and went to bed directly. I was thinking to return the motorbike the next day. But, on the second day, my plane was leaving so I totally forgot about this plan.
我們騎走摩托車後，我先把我的朋友載回他家，然後我再回去我的公寓，那時我已經很累，所以我就直接去睡覺，隔天我就想要把它還回去了，但是，我隔天忙著要處理回國的事，所以我就完全忘記這件事了。

我不知道，我有跟我的房東說這件事，他跟我說他不知道那是誰的摩托車，他覺得放在大樓前面不妥，也許摩托車是被移去那裡了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你知道後來摩托車主人報警了吧？在我們的法律上，竊盜罪是告訴乃論，也就是說，如果摩托車的主人願意不告你的話，那這個案子就可以撤掉，那你後來有跟對方有任何的溝通嗎？
You know that the owner of the motorcycle call for the police, right? In our country, the theft is a criminal brought to the court only when a lawsuit is filed. Which means that if the owner file a suit for you, this case can be removed. Then, did you try to communicate with the accuser?

We reached an agreement at the amount of NT$6,000. The owner accepted my apology. He brought the motorbike to the shop to have a check. The bike was not damaged and just needed a small tune-up.
我們用6000元達成和解，車主接受了我的道歉，他把他的機車帶到機車行檢查，摩托車沒有甚麼大問題，只要小小維修一下。

I have the copy at home but I can bring it next time.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'copy' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '在家裡' (at home) before the subject '我的那一份' (my copy), which is incorrect.

我們今天的程序是準備程序，會訂下一次的庭期，請你把和解書正本帶過來，那你還有沒有什麼要請法庭幫你調查的證據呢？那天跟你在一起的朋友，你希望法庭傳喚他做證人嗎？我的意思是，你需不需要他來幫忙你說明這個案情？
Today is the preparation procedure. We will set the date of the next proceeding. Please bring the original copy of the settlement letter with you the next time.

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他知道我會把機車還回去'.

那這樣子，我們下一次開庭的時候，會請你的朋友，也就是Mark Alison到庭，說明當天的情況，也會請摩托車所有人，也就是當事人到庭，說明和解的細由。
Then, in the next court, we will ask your friend, Mark Alison to the court to describe the details. We will also call for the motorcycle owner, also the accused to the court.

檢察官有無意見？

semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of 'reached an agreement at the amount of NT$6,000'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect subject-verb agreement in '我付他6000元賠償金'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'to the shop' in '他把車牽到維修廠檢查'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of 'just needed a small tune-up' in '摩托車沒有太大損壞，只需要小小維修'

雙方有達成和解金的數字嗎？
Did both parties decide the settlement amount?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the settlement amount.

Yes, NT$6,000 and I gave the money to the owner already.
是的，就如我剛剛所說，我已給他6000元的賠償金。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the person gave the money to the owner, while the user's translation mentions compensation instead.

那你們什麼時候要簽和解書呢，還是已經簽了呢？
When will you sign the settlement contract? Or you have already settled this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Have you already signed the settlement contract?'

We signed the settlement letter.
我們已經簽和解書了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我們簽了和解書'.

那今天有帶來嗎？
Do you bring that here?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you bring that here?'

I have the copy at home but I can bring it next time.
我家裡有一份，我下次可以帶來。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'copy' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '一份' (a copy) after '我家裡有' (I have at home), which changes the word order from the original text.

我們今天的程序是準備程序，會訂下一次的庭期，請你把和解書正本帶過來，那你還有沒有什麼要請法庭幫你調查的證據呢？那天跟你在一起的朋友，你希望法庭傳喚他做證人嗎？我的意思是，你需不需要他來幫忙你說明這個案情？
Today is the preparatory procedure. We will set the date next time and please bring the settlement here next time. Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate? Do you want your friend who was with you to be subpoenaed to the court? I mean, do you want your friend to help you describe the details of the case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate?'

My friend is in Taiwan now. Maybe he can help explain what happened that day. He knew that I planned to return the motorbike. I really meant it.
我的朋友已經回台灣了，也許他能幫我解釋案發狀況，他知道我原本就預計要還摩托車。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the friend is in Taiwan now.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the friend knew about the user's plan to return the motorbike.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user really meant to return the motorbike.

那這樣子，我們下一次開庭的時候，會請你的朋友，也就是Mark Alison到庭，說明當天的情況，也會請摩托車所有人，也就是當事人到庭，說明和解的細由。
Ok, so we’ll subpoena your friend, Mark Alison, to the next court to describe the details of the case. We’ll also ask the owner of the motorcycle to the court to describe the settlement details.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'We’ll subpoena your friend, Mark Alison, to the next court to describe the details of the case.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of 'also' before 'ask the owner of the motorcycle to the court to describe the settlement details.'

檢察官有無意見？
Do you have any further questions?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'opinion' in the translation.

沒有意見。
No.

檢察官這邊有沒有需要再調查的證據？
The prosecutor, is there any evidence to be investigated?

請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
The prosecutor, please state the crime.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'summary' which is an important detail in the original text.

如起訴書所載。
As stated in the indictment.

被告，你被檢察官起訴在民國109年3月8日於新北市樹林區學府路與大學路交叉口、7-11門口前，盜取他人摩托車一輛，車牌號碼為BL-1234，經由摩托車持有人報案後，警方於柑園路一段25號附近尋獲。經警方調閱7-11門口監視器，確認摩托車為你所竊，有何辯解？
The accused, your case are filed by the prosecutor on March 8, 2020. You stole the motorcycle in front of the 7-11 gate located on the intersection of 學府road and 大學road in New Taipei City. The plate number is BL-1234.The accuser found that you stole the motorcycle. After the police investigated the CCTV clips recording the scene on No.25, 柑園road section one, the found that it is you who stole the motorcycle. What is your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'Your case are filed by the prosecutor on March 8, 2020.' It should be 'Your case was filed by the prosecutor on March 8, 2020.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the location of the intersection, which is '樹林區' (Shulin District).

 I did not steal the motorcycle. On that day, it was rainy very hard. My friend and I did not bring an umbrella and we were in a hurry to get home. So, we decided to borrow the motorcycle. Our plan was to give it back, you know, we planned to put the motorbike back to the original place the second day. We didn’t mean to steal it at all.
我認為我沒有罪。我沒有偷摩托車。那一天的雨下得很大。我和我的朋友都沒帶傘，所以我們急急忙忙地回家。所以我們決定要借一台摩托車。我們的計畫是我們會在隔天把摩托車還到原本的地方。我們完全沒有想要偷它。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我認為我沒有罪' (I believe I am not guilty). The correct word order should be '我認為沒有罪我' (I believe not guilty).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the phrase 'On that day' in the sentence '那一天的雨下得很大' (On that day, it was raining heavily).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the phrase 'and we were in a hurry to get home' in the sentence '我和我的朋友都沒帶傘，所以我們急急忙忙地回家' (My friend and I didn't bring an umbrella, so we hurriedly went home).

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the phrase 'at all' in the sentence '我們完全沒有想要偷它' (We didn't mean to steal it at all).

沒有帶傘就可以偷人家車子嗎？
You didn’t bring umbrella doesn’t mean that you can steal other’s motorcycle.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'bring' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'You didn't bring an umbrella'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation changes the meaning of the original text. The original text talks about stealing a car, but the user's translation mentions stealing a motorcycle.

No, but I was in a hurry to go home that day. My plane was leaving on the second day to go back to my country. I am really sorry. That was a terrible mistake.
沒有我那天是真的很想趕快回家。我明天回國的班機延誤了。對於這個意外、錯誤，我真的很抱歉。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the plane delay and the specific day of departure.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '明天' (tomorrow) before the verb '回國' (go back to my country), which is incorrect in Chinese.

為什麼會偷那部車子呢？我的意思是為什麼是那部，而不是別部車呢
So why did you steal that motorcycle? I mean why this one, not other motorcycles?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '車子' as 'motorcycle' instead of 'car'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'steal' before the subject 'you', which is incorrect in English.

At that time, I just came out from the convenience store. It was raining and I saw that motorcycle. I realized the owner must have forgotten to take out the key. I thought I could use it briefly and bring it back soon.
那時候我剛從便利商店出來。當時正在下著大雨，而我正好看到那台摩托車。我發現摩托車的主人忘記拔鑰匙了。所以我決定很快的把它騎走，然後盡快把它還回來。
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	missing comma after introductory phrase
omission or addition	word order errors	incorrect placement of adverb

你的意思是那個摩托車的主人，忘了把鑰匙拿走嗎？
So, do you mean the owner forgot to take out the key?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the mention of the motorcycle in their translation.

Yes, the key was left in the ignition, so I just rode the motorbike away.
對，因為鑰匙忘了拔孔，所以我就騎走了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我就騎走了' instead of '因為鑰匙忘了拔孔，所以我就騎走了。'

那你剛剛說，原來的計畫是要把車子還回去，那你有這樣做嗎？
You said that you planned to give the motorcycle back. Did you do that?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '車子' as 'motorcycle' instead of 'car'.

After we rode the bike away, I first gave my friend a ride home. Then I went back to my apartment. I was very tired and went to bed directly. I was thinking to return the motorbike the next day. But, on the second day, my plane was leaving so I totally forgot about this plan.
當我們騎走之後，我是先載我友人回家。於是我就回到我的住處我真的很累，所以我直接就睡著了。我那時候有想說隔天要還回去。第二天的時候，我的飛機就走了，所以我就忘記這件事情。

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that their plane was leaving on the second day.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that they totally forgot about the plan to return the motorbike.

那為什麼車子後來會跑到柑園路去了呢？
So, why did the motorcycle appear on 柑園road that day?
semantic conversion	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I don’t know. I talked to my landlord. He told me that he didn’t know whose motorbike that was. He didn’t feel comfortable about having it parked in front of our apartment building. Maybe the motorbike was moved there.
我不知道啊，所以我問我的房東。他跟我說他不知道那台摩托車是誰的。他不太高興有一台摩托車停在我們公寓門口。所以摩托車可能就是被移去那裡了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "所以摩托車可能就是被移去那裡了" is incorrect. The correct word order should be "所以摩托車可能就是被移去了那裡".

你知道後來摩托車主人報警了吧？在我們的法律上，竊盜罪是告訴乃論，也就是說，如果摩托車的主人願意不告你的話，那這個案子就可以撤掉，那你後來有跟對方有任何的溝通嗎？
Do you know that the police have started to find out this case?In our nation, this is a crime that brought to court only when the lawsuit is filed.That means if the accuser didn’t want to file a case against you, he can drop the case.Did you try to negotiate with the accuser?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'Do you know that the police have started to find out this case?'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '告訴乃論' as 'brought to court only when the lawsuit is filed', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original phrase.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the motorcycle owner reported the theft to the police.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the accuser can drop the case if they do not want to file a lawsuit.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the question asking if the user tried to negotiate with the accuser.

Yes, when I returned to Taiwan after that trip, the police told me about this case. I met with the motorbike owner. I said sorry to him and agreed to offer him some money.
對，在我旅遊完會到台灣後，警察就告訴我這件事。我和摩托車主人見了面。我向他道歉，並且也同意說會付一些賠償金給他。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence "在我旅遊完會到台灣後" is incorrect. It should be "在我旅遊完後回到台灣".
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the motorbike owner was involved in the case.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user offered money as compensation to the motorbike owner.

那調解的過程怎麼樣，對方願意接受你的道歉嗎？
So, how was the settlement procedure? Did the owner accept your apology?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

We reached an agreement at the amount of NT$6,000. The owner accepted my apology. He brought the motorbike to the shop to have a check. The bike was not damaged and just needed a small tune-up.
我們最後以六千元新台幣和解。車主也接受了我的道歉。他將摩托車帶去維修廠檢查。車並沒有損壞，只是需要一點微調。

雙方有達成和解金的數字嗎？
Did the two parties meet the amount?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

Yes, NT$6,000 and I gave the money to the owner already.
沒有錯，我們的和解金是新台幣六千，而我們也給了車主。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那你們什麼時候要簽和解書呢，還是已經簽了呢？
So when did you sign the settlement contract? Or you have signed already?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you sign the settlement contract already?'

We signed the settlement letter.
我們在當天隨後就簽下和解書。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們隨後在當天簽下和解書。'

那今天有帶來嗎？
Did you bring it with you today?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'it' in the translation.

I have the copy at home but I can bring it next time.
我在家裡有一份影本，那我下次可以帶來。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'copy' in their translation.

我們今天的程序是準備程序，會訂下一次的庭期，請你把和解書正本帶過來，那你還有沒有什麼要請法庭幫你調查的證據呢？那天跟你在一起的朋友，你希望法庭傳喚他做證人嗎？我的意思是，你需不需要他來幫忙你說明這個案情？
Today this is a preparation procedure.We will decide the next court, so please bring the original text of the contract.Did you ask the court to investigate any evidence?Do you want to call for the friend at that day?I mean, do you want him to come here to help you figure out this case?

grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他知道我要還這機車，他真的知道。'

那這樣子，我們下一次開庭的時候，會請你的朋友，也就是Mark Alison到庭，說明當天的情況，也會請摩托車所有人，也就是當事人到庭，說明和解的細由。
Okay, so in next court, I will ask your friend to come here to help you figure out the situation.We will also invite the accuser here to file the case.

檢察官有無意見？

At that time, I just came out from the convenience store. It was raining and I saw that motorcycle. I realized the owner must have forgotten to take out the key. I thought I could use it briefly and bring it back soon.
當時我剛從便利商店出來。那時候在下雨然後我剛好就看到那一台摩托車。我發現摩托車的主人忘記把鑰匙拔出來了。我想說可以快速的使用一下這個摩托車然後還回來。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '那時候在下雨然後我剛好就看到那一台摩托車' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '那時候我剛好就看到那一台摩托車在下雨。'

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the detail that the assistant 'thought I could use it briefly and bring it back soon.'

你的意思是那個摩托車的主人，忘了把鑰匙拿走嗎？
Do you mean the owner of the motorcycle forgot to take the keys away?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, the key was left in the ignition, so I just rode the motorbike away.
對，因為車鑰匙忘了拔，所以我就直接把摩托車騎走了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '所以我就直接把摩托車騎走了' instead of '因為車鑰匙忘了拔，所以我就直接把摩托車騎走了。'

那你剛剛說，原來的計畫是要把車子還回去，那你有這樣做嗎？
Just as what you mentioned, you say that you will… um.. you will returnthe motorcycle back. Did you do that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

After we rode the bike away, I first gave my friend a ride home. Then I went back to my apartment. I was very tired and went to bed directly. I was thinking to return the motorbike the next day. But, on the second day, my plane was leaving so I totally forgot about this plan.
在我們騎走之後，我讓我朋友騎回家，然後我就回我的公寓了。因為太累了，我就直接去睡了。我想說明天在還回去就好了，可是因為隔天我就要走了，所以我完全忘了這回事。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我讓我朋友騎回家' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我讓我的朋友騎回家'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the bike was a motorbike. The correct translation should be '我讓我的朋友騎回家'.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user's plane was leaving on the second day. The correct translation should be '因為隔天我就要走了'.

那為什麼車子後來會跑到柑園路去了呢？
Then why did the motorcycle end up at Gan-Yuan Road?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '車子' as 'motorcycle' instead of 'car'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'end up' before the subject 'motorcycle', resulting in incorrect word order.

I don’t know. I talked to my landlord. He told me that he didn’t know whose motorbike that was. He didn’t feel comfortable about having it parked in front of our apartment building. Maybe the motorbike was moved there.
我不知道，但我跟地主談過了。他告訴我她不太知道那台摩托車是誰的。他覺得把這台摩托車停在我們租的這棟大樓前面感到很不舒服。所以也許這台摩托車被他移動到那了。

你知道後來摩托車主人報警了吧？在我們的法律上，竊盜罪是告訴乃論，也就是說，如果摩托車的主人願意不告你的話，那這個案子就可以撤掉，那你後來有跟對方有任何的溝通嗎？
Do you know that the owner of the motorcycle have called the police? According to our law, theft is a crime is brought to the court only when the lawsuit is filed. That is to say, if the owner of the motorcycle decided not to sue you, and the case will be….will be …..dropped. Do you have.. Do you try to communicate with the other party?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence 'That is to say, if the owner of the motorcycle decided not to sue you, and the case will be… will be… dropped.' is incorrect.
grammar and structure	omission of details	The user's translation omits the information about whether the user tried to communicate with the other party.

Yes, when I returned to Taiwan after that trip, the police told me about this case. I met with the motorbike owner. I said sorry to him and agreed to offer him some money.
有的，我回台灣的時候警察有告知我關於這個案件的詳情。我和摩托車車主見了面。我跟他說了對不起然後同意提供金錢賠償。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

那調解的過程怎麼樣，對方願意接受你的道歉嗎？
Then how was the mediation? Did the other party accept your conditions?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

We reached an agreement at the amount of NT$6,000. The owner accepted my apology. He brought the motorbike to the shop to have a check. The bike was not damaged and just needed a small tune-up.
我們達成了共識，決定我要賠他6000元。而摩托車的車主接受了我的道歉，他把他的車子帶去檢查，摩托車並沒有壞掉，只是需要一點小小的維修。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated 'reached an agreement' as '達成了共識' instead of '達成了協議', which is a more accurate translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'amount' as '賠' instead of '金額', which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '我們' after the verb '達成了共識', which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我們達成了共識'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the owner bringing the motorbike to the shop for a check.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the bike not being damaged and only needing a small tune-up.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '決定我要賠他6000元' which is not present in the original text.

雙方有達成和解金的數字嗎？
Did… did both of you reach the …. mediation amount?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, NT$6,000 and I gave the money to the owner already.
有阿，我們決定和解金是6000元，我也把錢給他了。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '已經給了' as '給他了', which changes the meaning from 'gave the money to the owner' to 'gave him the money'.

那你們什麼時候要簽和解書呢，還是已經簽了呢？
Then when are you going to sign the settlement paper? Or have you signed it already?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Have you signed it already?'

We signed the settlement letter.
我們已經簽了和解書了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order should be '我們簽了和解書了。'
omission or addition	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a period at the end of the sentence.

那今天有帶來嗎？
Then did you bring it today?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the subject of the sentence, which is 'it'.

I have the copy at home but I can bring it next time.
在家有影本，但是我下次可以帶來。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'copy' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

我們今天的程序是準備程序，會訂下一次的庭期，請你把和解書正本帶過來，那你還有沒有什麼要請法庭幫你調查的證據呢？那天跟你在一起的朋友，你希望法庭傳喚他做證人嗎？我的意思是，你需不需要他來幫忙你說明這個案情？
Our case today is a preparatory procedure. We will set the date of the next court, and please bring the settlement paper with you next time. Do you need other…investigation that need court to help you? Do you hope to…do you hope that we supo… supone your friend? I mean that do you need … do you need your friend to help you explain the case?

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'I mean that do you need … do you need your friend to help you explain the case?'

My friend is in Taiwan now. Maybe he can help explain what happened that day. He knew that I planned to return the motorbike. I really meant it.
我朋友現在在台灣，也許他可以一起解釋那天發生了什麼。他知道我打算要把車子還回去。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他知道我打算把車子還回去。'

那這樣子，我們下一次開庭的時候，會請你的朋友，也就是Mark Alison到庭，說明當天的情況，也會請摩托車所有人，也就是當事人到庭，說明和解的細由。
So, so we will invite your friend, Mark, to come here and explain what happened that day. We will also invite the .. the owner of the motorcycle, the involved party to come here and explained the settlement details.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'We will also invite the owner of the motorcycle, the involved party, to come here and explain the settlement details.'

檢察官有無意見？
Prosecutor, do you have anything to say?

沒有意見。

檢察官這邊有沒有需要再調查的證據？
And Prosecutor, do you have any evidence to be investigated?

沒有。

Same as the indictment.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The plaintiff…the plaintiff…the plaintiff wanted to file the case against his… her husband for… for the suspect that he is having an affair with his coworkers. Because she has found some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphones, and, sometimes, her husband would make up reasons for extra hours for the… his work. Also, he would have tele-conference with his coworkers, so the plaintiff is suspect that her husband has a relationship with his coworker beyond coworker’s relationship. The defendant, your wife sue you with the adultery case, what’s your plea?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in several sentences.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the translation.

Not guilty, of course.
當然無罪。

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s procedure, first, we are going to examine the text messages between the defendant and his coworker, and we will…we will decided whether this message would constitute adultery case. Does the plaintiff…Do the plaintiff and the defendant fully understand today’s procedure?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question 'Does the plaintiff...Do the plaintiff and the defendant fully understand today’s procedure?' is incorrect.

我明白
Yes, I understand.

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, I want to ask the plaintiff, how long have you been married? Do you guys have kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have been married for 4 years, and we didn’t.. and we don’t have kids.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'already' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
So…did you and your husband get married in Taiwan, or you get married in foreign country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
My husband and I met in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he was here to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The verb 'was' should be in the past tense to match the time frame mentioned.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
Then, during the past few years, is his job in Taiwan teaching Portuguese?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '教葡萄牙文' as 'teaching Portuguese', which is a mismatched meaning.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a teacher to teach Portuguese. Then, after we get married, he still teaching Portuguese. However, in Taiwan, Portuguese is not a popular language to learn from, so, sometimes, he didn’t have a… his teaching hour is not stable or regular, and sometimes, there are a period between jobs that is as long as a month or even two month. Then , in order to have a steady and stable incomes, he decided to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree on English.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'he didn’t have a… his teaching hour is not stable or regular'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'job' in the sentence: 'sometimes, he didn’t have a… his teaching hour is not stable or regular'

omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'to' in the sentence: 'he decided to seek an advanced degree on English'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. It means that he seek an advanced degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the person mentioned in the original text is seeking an advanced degree in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wanted to teach English, so the degree of his seeking has to be about English teaching. He found an Internet courses about distance learning program in the University of California, and this course is that he doesn’t have to go to America to learn, but he can have a distance learning in Taiwan about English teaching. So after he finishes all the credits of the internet courses, then he can get a master degree. Therefore, he can use this American advanced degree to English teaching job in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'because the degree of his seeking has to be about English teaching' should be 'because he has to seek a degree about English teaching'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'the degree of his seeking' should be 'the degree he is seeking'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'the degree of his seeking has to be about English teaching' should be 'he has to seek a degree in English teaching'.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then... What is his relationship with the person he had affair with?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are the coworkers in the cram school. And in the cram school, they have a program that a Chinese teacher would partner up with an foreign teacher, so the woman is his partner.
minor categories of semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '補習班' as 'cram school' instead of 'tutoring center'.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they are having an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'affair' instead of 'having an affair'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At the beginning, I found out that he started to work over hours, so I confronted with him that why he has to spend so much time in a English cram school. And he told me that he have to communicate with the Chinese teacher, so he has to spend the extra hours. So I told him that it just a cram school, why should he spend another hours. At first, I didn’t doubt him. Then I found out that he would answer some calls. And when he answer that phone, he didn’t talk in front of me. He went to the study room to have the phone call. And then I examine his phone, the texts he got, then I found out that there are something wrong.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So… in his phone, did you find anything unusual?
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'did' before the subject 'you' in the translation, which is incorrect.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
First, I look up his phone book. Then I found out that there is a same number that calls over and over. And then I found out that the texts he got are all from the same person, the same woman. Then I realize that he and that woman text every single day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'look up his phone book' instead of 'check his text messages'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the texts were sent by the woman.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the texts were exchanged every day.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even though they are texting, it is alright. It is not a big deal. The context is fine. It’s not horrible, right?

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it was a very normal and regular text, it would be fine. But he is a married man, and in the texts, there are some intimate message, and those message I have already filed to the court as the evidence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
As you can see the exhibit 1, there was the context of the message, and I would like to ask the defendant, are those messages from your cellphone?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機裡的訊息。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
If that’s so, I would like to ask you some questions about these message. The first, I would like to ask the text from the cellphone number 0958932123 on December 21st, 2018. The time was 9:50 p.m. And in the context, it was written, “I really miss you my love.” What did it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那個簡訊是從我的同事那傳給我的，那時候我請了兩天假，然後他就覺得有點小擔心，然後傳簡訊來關心我一下而已。我的同事是在美國受的教育，所以他才會這麼的開放，那這些說話方式也只是她表達他自己的一些說法，那剛剛提到的那個my love，也就只是我們稱我們關心的人的親暱的名字。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So what you mean is that, the person was educated in the west, so her mind is westernized. And therefore, the way she express her emotion and feelings are more open? And so…the phrase “my love” is not a big deal and didn’t mean anything.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of 'my love' and assumes it doesn't have any special meaning.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
是的，那只是我們在比較親密的朋友之間會稱呼彼此的方式而已。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the cultural meaning of the expression.

那她前面那句呢？
How about the first part of the message?

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我剛剛說的阿，他就只是擔心我而已，因為那時候…我們兩個是工作上的搭檔。所以在我請兩天假的時候，他就是非常的擔心我。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person being referred to is a female.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker was away for two days.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person being referred to naturally missed the speaker.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So what you mean is that the person…when you are away, she needs your assistance during the teaching, so she sent you the message to express her worries and concerns,. Is that what you mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，那就是這簡訊的意義，所以這封簡訊根本就沒有什麼大不了的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'no big deal' is translated as '根本就沒有什麼大不了的', which means 'nothing serious' or 'nothing important', but it does not capture the intended meaning of 'no big deal'.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Then, we will examine the second message. It was sent by the same cellphone. And the time was on December 29th, 2017 at 11:55 p.m. It was written, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this text mean? Could you explain?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他寫這個訊息就只是想要問我說，在我的中文文本中要怎麼翻成英文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean is that she sent you the message in order to help you to accomplish your homework? What does it even mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我太太剛剛在前面的時候跟法庭告知的，我現在在上一堂就是碩士的課程，那這整個課程有三十個學分，那為了要完成這三十個學分，裡面難免會有些作業跟一些練習，那我當然要完成這些東西。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Could you first explain what did you major in for your master degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的主修是在英語教學，那在其中的一些課程安排上，就是有些英語教學的課程沒錯，那來有另一個部分是關於文化以及語言能力的一些課程，那就當然其中有一些...這些東西。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the translation.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	Misinterpretation of the cultural reference in the translation.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you mean that the field you choose is TESOL, there are some culture and language communication in the course?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of cultural communication courses in the original text.
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation does not accurately convey the polite tone of the original text.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我印象中是起碼有三堂課跟文化語言溝通有關的課。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what is the assignment which is related to the cultural and language communication?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific details of the assignment.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這堂課程的作業在每個學生身上都不太一樣。那以我為例的話，因為我現在在台灣，然後想要取得英文教學的工作，那為了要達成這個目標，那勢必我是一定要有能力去掌握中文。所以我有很多的作業是要怎麼中翻英或是英翻中。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
Therefore, in order to fulfill the plan that you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to finish and complete the assignment or translate English into Chinese, or Chinese into English?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，而同時間我也被耀球說我要精進我的口說及寫作的能力。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation misrepresents the original text by adding the mention of a specific activity (耀球) that is not present in the original text.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Okay, then we will go back to the texts we have been presenting, so the text was your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，那就是我的作業，那在當時的時候，我拿到句子的時候，我完全不知道要怎麼翻，你也知道，就是中文有些詞彙就是很難翻譯成英文，所以在當時我拿到作業時，我完全不知道該怎麼翻譯，所以我就是向我的同事求助，那我就請他在翻完之後，將翻譯傳簡訊給我。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific sentence that they asked their colleague to translate for them.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is not in correct English word order.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word 'translate' instead of 'interpret' when referring to their colleague's assistance.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Well, according by your claim, that this text message was only the question of your assignment. And the college is only translate the assignment for you and give you the answer. Is that what you claim?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
對，那個內容只是我功課的答案而已。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Okay, now the defendant please read the exhibit 1, page 14 to page 16, are all these messages the answers of your assignment for your master degree?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些簡訊內容都只是為了要完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Well… what’s your explanation about your wife suspect that you are having an affair with your coworker. What’s your explanation?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我太太真的是在這件事情上想太多了，我一直知道他一直很不滿意我養家活口的能力，而在我一開始要在去進修，取得碩士學位的時候後，他就完全沒有表現出支持我的舉動或是…沒有任何支持。因為她一直沒有就是表現出任何支持，所以我就沒有想要去問他，或是請他幫我完成這些作業，而我就覺得說，他就是這整個誤解的罪魁禍首。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated 'supportive' as '表現出支持' which means 'showing support' instead of '支持' which means 'support'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the subject '他' (he) after the verb '知道' (know) which is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我知道他' (I know he).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'has never shown any support' which is an important detail in the original text.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your explanation, it seems that there are some unhappiness between you and your wife?

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在一開始新婚的時候，我們的確過得很愉快，但是就是主要問題就是我的工作，因為在我一開始在這裡教授葡萄牙文，但是一直碰壁又碰到困難，就變成了我們主要的問題。所以就，我的工作就變成我們吵架的問題，我們就時常為了這種問題吵架，然後這整個狀況，造成我非常的沮喪、非常的洩氣、非常的挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: '在我一開始在這裡教授葡萄牙文' should be '我一開始在這裡教授葡萄牙文'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: '就變成了我們主要的問題' should be '就變成了我們的主要問題'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: '然後這整個狀況，造成我非常的沮喪、非常的洩氣、非常的挫折' should be '然後這整個狀況，讓我非常沮喪、非常洩氣、非常挫折'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay, then we’ll go back to your master degree. When did you start your master degree? Do you finish it? And when will you get your diplomat?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Did you finish it?' instead of 'Do you finish it?'
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb 'finish' should be past tense to match the question about the completion of the master's degree. It should be 'Did you finish it?' instead of 'Do you finish it?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	There should be a question mark at the end of the sentence to indicate that it is a question.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年的秋天註冊的，就開始這個課程那他預計是兩年的課程，那我應該會是在2017年的五月的時候畢業，但是我一直沒有完成這個學位是因為我一直都有一些兼職工作，所以我就沒有時間去完成我的那些作業。就像我剛剛提到的，就我太太一直都沒有很支持我的這個決定，所以在整個求學過程中我一直覺得很沮喪，而且很累，所以我就還沒有拿到這個學位。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我是在2015年的秋天註冊的，就開始這個課程那他預計是兩年的課程'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Incorrect tense usage in the sentence '那我應該會是在2017年的五月的時候畢業'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '我一直都有一些兼職工作，所以我就沒有時間去完成我的那些作業'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated in the sentence '我一直覺得很沮喪，而且很累'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not receiving the degree in the sentence '所以我就還沒有拿到這個學位'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling alone in the sentence '我一直覺得很沮喪，而且很累'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for lack of support from the wife in the sentence '就我太太一直都沒有很支持我的這個決定'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not having enough time in the sentence '所以我就沒有時間去完成我的那些作業'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program in the sentence '我一直都有一些兼職工作，所以我就沒有時間去完成我的那些作業'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
So you just mentioned that this program is designed for 2 years, and you didn’t finish it, so what is the main reason of that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成所有的課程作業，還有一些課程的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So when is the last semester you register?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後一個學期是在2017年的春天註冊的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
So if it is true, as you just mentioned, that the course has already finish in May, 2017. So it is reasonable that after the course you didn’t have any assignment. But after the semester has ended, during the 7 months you have the text message with your coworker, what’s the purpose.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the course ending in May 2017.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'after the semester has ended' in the wrong position in the sentence.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
就算我沒有完成我的學位，也不代表說我就不要再精進我的語言能力，所以在這個課程結束後，我就還是做一些作業、一些練習，就是我是自學啦，自修這樣子。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of studying Chinese in their own translation.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean that despite you didn’t finish the course, you still want to improve your language competence, so you continue to write this text?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'learning Chinese' in their translation.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's word order is incorrect in the phrase 'so you continue to write this text'. It should be 'so you continue writing this text'.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是為什麼我會向我的同事求救。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So this coworker you have, she is like tutor, Chinese tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '家教' as 'Chinese tutor' instead of 'tutor'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
他不是我的家教而已，他更是一個很好很好的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
So… do you pay her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我原本說要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我原本說要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you didn’t pay her, why she answers your texts in the middle of the night? Doesn’t it exceed the relationship of being a coworker?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就是為什麼我會說他是個非常好的朋友，因為他是利用他自己的時間在教我中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The subject and verb should be reversed.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still work in the cram school as a English teacher?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'Do you still teach English in the cram school?'

Yes, I am still working there.
是的，我還在那邊工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does the coworker still worker there?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'worker' should be in the present tense to agree with the subject 'coworker'.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，他還在那邊工作，但我們現在已經不是搭檔了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們現在已經不是搭檔了' instead of '但我們現在已經不是搭檔了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any other witness or other evidence that you wanted to provided to the court or the person you want to subpoena further?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I would like the court to subpoena the coworker, Rong-er Huang as witness to clarify the evidence of the texts and to clarify and explain the relationship of the defendant and her.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the important details of the coworker's job at the Meimei Tutorial Center and the purpose of clarifying the relationship and background of the text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase 'the evidence of the texts'. It should be 'the texts as evidence'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The plaintiff, do you have any other evidence you want the court to investigate for you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the plaintiff in their translation.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'do' instead of 'does' in the question.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I have heard that the cram school trying to fix the relationship with my husband and the coworker, and they’re trying to convince the coworker to leave, to quit the job. So I wanted the court to ask the cram school for further statement or subpoena them as witness.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '女黃蓉兒' as 'the coworker' instead of 'the woman Huang Rong'er'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the cram school's actions towards the relationship.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any other evidence the you want the court to investigate for you. Now the situation is that, because your degree program have already finished in May, 2017, so it cannot be the evidence or explanation for your relationship with your coworker. And most of your message is sent at 9 p.m. Therefore, it is a very suspicious movement or relationship between you and your coworker. Therefore, do you have any other evidence that you can prove that you and your coworker are only the relationship of college or friend to clarify that. Do you have any other evidence to clarify that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'because your degree program have already finished in May, 2017' should be 'because your degree program has already finished in May, 2017'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'because your degree program have already finished' should be 'because your degree program has already finished'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Misinterpretation of the phrase '起人疑竇' as 'suspicious movement or relationship' instead of 'raising suspicions'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'to clarify that' at the end of the translation.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我目前想步道法院可以幫我調查的證據，就像我所說的，我跟我同事之間的關係非常的單純，我們倆之間的訊息就只是為了要增進我的語言能力以及我的中文能力而已。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court date is set on June 24th, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. as the inquiry of witness, and during the procedure, we will ask both party, the plaintiff and the defendant to explain the situation. If it is necessary, both party can have the layer to attend the court.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.
我也明白。

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的

So, in the past years, has he taught Portuguese in Taiwan for four years?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he taught Portuguese. And after we got married, he continued teaching Portuguese. However, you know that Portuguese in Taiwan is not a popular language, and it’s not common, so the teaching hours is not stable, and sometimes will even have a period between jobs. And sometimes, the period between jobs could last for one to two months. And because my husband wants to have a stable income, so he wanted to …tended to teach English. And however, his mother tongue is not English, so he sought an advanced degree and want to polish his English.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'And after we got married, he continued teaching Portuguese.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband's teaching hours were unstable and sometimes there were gaps between jobs.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband wanted to teach English to have a stable income.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband's mother tongue is not English and he wanted to improve his English by seeking an advanced degree.

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned your husband wanted to polish his English, and does it mean that he wanted to seek an advanced degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'polish his English' instead of 'seek an advanced degree'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he wanted to seek an advanced degree which is about TESOL. So my husband have a distance learning program, which is provided by… which is taught from California, America, and had a distance learning program. And he only has to learn on distance learning and do not have to come to America. In this way, after all the credits he got from the distance learning program, he can get a master degree and after gets a master degree, he can be an English teacher and teachs English in Taiwan.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of 'seek' instead of 'take'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect placement of 'So my husband have a distance learning program'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the name of the institution providing the distance learning program

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with in this adultery case?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'adultery' is not accurately translated as '外遇' which means 'extramarital affair'.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
My husband and the person he has an affair with is his colleague. Because the distance learning program have an arrangement of both… Chinese and foreign teacher. And in the distance learning program, they are colleague and have to partner with each other.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation completely changes the meaning of the original text, referring to an extramarital affair instead of colleagues in a tutoring class.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have affairs and beyond co-worker’s relationship?

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
at first, I noticed the strange thing it is because my husband started to work overtime in school and I just wonder my husband just go to learn English and want to seek an advanced degree, and why do you have to work overtime? And he said it is because he had a Chinese teacher, and he had to partner with her, so he has to work in school and communicate with her, so they can learn better. In the beginning, I didn’t suspect he would do the adultery. I started to think strange and it was because after he came back from school, he started to have many different calls, and the more important is that he wouldn’t talk in front of me. Instead, he would go to the study and talked. And because I think it’s strange, so I checked her cellphone and found many messages.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	adultery instead of suspicion
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	learn English instead of teach English
omission or addition	omitting important details	not mentioning the discovery of messages on the cellphone
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	mentioning seeking an advanced degree

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
so, did you find any unusual messages in his cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
In my husband’s phone book, there is always the same phone number, so I found it stranger and I checked his message. I found he always has messages with the same woman every day.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '好奇的又去查' as 'found it stranger and I checked' which does not accurately convey the meaning of curiosity.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of '查了之後' which indicates that the user checked the messages after finding the same phone number.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
And even though he always has text message with the same woman, does it… why would you think it’s strange? It seems fine. Or did you see any strange message in her cellphone?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If the message is just some common words, and I won’t find something strange, and will prosecute adultery case. and it is because the message is very intimate, and just before today’s proceeding, I had provided some of the messages to the judge, and I think all the contents are in the file.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The original text mentions that the person in question is married and wonders why they would send intimate messages to someone else. However, the user's translation mentions prosecuting an adultery case, which is not mentioned in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of providing the messages to the judge before the proceeding, which is an important detail in the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Exhibit evidence1 and page 13: here is the message content that your wife provided to the court, and the defendant you can check whether the message content is true.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些是在我手機裡面的簡訊內容。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'messages' is translated as '簡訊內容' which means 'message content' instead of '簡訊' which means 'messages'.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
well, so I will ask you some details in these messages. And the first message, the time is on December 21st, 2018. And the time is at 9:50 pm. The phone number is 0958932123. This phone number sent a message to your cellphone, and the contents of the message is 我非常想你. So what’s your plea? What’s your reaction to this intimate message?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那是我一個同事傳給我的訊息，那當時我放了兩天假，因為我的同事很擔心，所以他傳了這封訊息給我。我的同事是在美國長大的，所以她是非常心胸寬大的，他講話一直都是這麼直接這樣子如此，那我們兩個在稱呼彼此親近的人的時候，會直接稱我的寶貝、我的愛。我們一直都是用這樣的說詞，所以我並不覺得有任何的不妥。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural references and idiomatic expressions

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
so what you mean is that the people who sent the message…because she has stayed in the foreign countries for several years, so her thought is westernized, and she is kind of open-minded. So even she said my love to you don’t have any other special meanings?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of '我的愛' (my love) and fails to understand its significance in the context.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
哦對啊，這並沒有任何的意義，這只是我們對於親近的朋友，關心的說詞而已，表達我們是好朋友、彼此關心的意思。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
So what about the previous message she just sent to you? I really missed you, this sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the previous message that the speaker mentioned.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
正如同我剛剛所說過的，那是因為她擔心我，我們彼此是夥伴關係，那當時我請了兩天假，她自然而來會關心我，所以才發了這則訊息給我、表達他的關心。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Well, so you mean that it is just because you had two days off, and do not go to work, and because she is your partner in the distance learning program, without you she has no assistance, so she sent this message to you, it’s that right?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，所以這個訊息就是這樣子來的，這並沒有什麼了不起、很特別或是很奇怪的事情。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation adds unnecessary content and changes the meaning of the original text. The original text states that the message was 'no big deal', but the user's translation adds that it is not 'special or strange'. This addition changes the meaning and adds a negative connotation that is not present in the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
Let’s move to the exhibit evidence two. The message happened at 11:55pm, on December 29th on 2017. And the message is also sent from the same phone number, and the content is 我想要在你身旁，我們什麼時候才可以再一起呢？ So I want to by your side, and when we can truly be together? So what does it mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
當時她是想學著如何用中文來表達意思，所以她傳了這封訊息給我？
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the assignment in their translation.
inappropriate cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence in their translation.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
so you mean that she, your colleague, sent this message to you, and the purpose is to help you do the homework. So what does it mean, I don’t really know…I don’t really get you.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misunderstood the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
當我老婆有起訴我們通姦這件事的時候，我正在修遠距課程，並想要得到碩士學位，在這個課程當中，我需要修30學分。那自然地，為了完成這30個學分，我必須完成一些作業跟練習，那我的夥伴就協助我完成這些作業。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation misinterprets the original meaning of attending a Master's program as taking a distance learning course.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the requirement to complete assignments and exercises in the program.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation adds the mention of a partner helping with the assignments, which is not present in the original text.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
I want to ask…so what do you really study in your master program? I don’t understand, can you explain to me?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是關於英語教學。那裡面就有關於英語教學、以及文化相關以及語言能力的培訓。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '碩士學位' which means 'master's degree' instead of '課程' which means 'program' in this context.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'TESOL' is not translated and remains in English, which may cause confusion for readers who are not familiar with the term.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention that the courses were part of a program, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation includes the phrase '我的碩士學位是' which means 'my master's degree is', but this information is not present in the original text.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation does not use appropriate honorific language or formal expressions, which may be expected in a formal academic context.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So what you mean is that the TESOL that you studied in your master program, and in the master program, it contains some of courses about culture and communication, is that right?

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，然後我記得在這個碩士學位當中，有三堂課是關於文化以及溝通的課程。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So the courses about culture and communication, what’s the common assignment that the teacher will assign you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'common' in the question, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
在這些文化課程當中，每個人的作業都會依照每個人在讀這個碩士學位的目的而有改變。那像我呢，我在讀這個碩士學位，是想要得到之後能在台灣教英文，因此我必須要展現我對中文有優秀的掌握能力。也是因為這樣，所以我的作業很多都是關於中文跟英文句子的翻譯。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean that because you plan to teach English in Taiwan, and you have to show that you has a good command of Chinese, so in order to complete your assignment, you have to translate the English sentence into Chinese, is that right?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'has' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'you have' instead of 'you has'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence should be 'you have to translate the English sentence into Chinese' instead of 'you has to translate the English sentence into Chinese'.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，此外我還需要去磨練我的口說以及寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So, let’s move back to the exhibit evidence two, the message. Do you mean that this message is one of your assignments?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，這就是我當時的作業，我記得當初我看到這句話中文的時候，其實我並不了解它的意思，畢竟中文很多用字對外國人來說是很難了解的，因為我不懂，所以我去找我的partner幫忙，請他幫忙把這句話翻成英文，再把答案傳給我。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits important details from the original text.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The translation does not adapt the idiomatic expressions to the target language.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Well, so that sentence, I want to by your side, kind of this sentence, is the situation just you wanted her to translate the Chinese sentence, and at that time, you asked her to send the correct answer to you. So it’s the total situation at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
是的，那句話就只是我作業的解答而已。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
The defendant, let’s move to the exhibit evidence one, page 14 to16. Please… so now you can browse all the messages in this evidence, so you mean that all the messages are part of your assignments?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the purpose of the messages, which is seeking help from the other person for their homework.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
沒錯，這些訊息都是為了完成作業，才有這些訊息。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'Yes' as '沒錯' does not accurately convey the meaning of agreement in this context.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '這些訊息都是為了完成作業，才有這些訊息。'

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
and your wife just said that you and your colleague have the adultery, and what do you want to explain?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
關於外遇這件事，我覺得一直以來都是我老婆想太多。我知道我在這個家庭中，我其實沒辦法支撐家庭的很多重擔，不過在這個課程當中，我的太太就也沒有…從我的課程開始到現在，我的妻子也沒有給我任何的協助。在我上碩士課程當中，我太太一直都不願意來協助我完成任何作業，要不是他這樣子不支持我，我也不需要請求我的中文夥伴來協助我，所以我覺得現在發生的一切，都不能怪到我頭上。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	外遇 (extramarital affair) was incorrectly translated as 這件事 (this matter)
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 我老婆想太多 (My wife thinks too much) instead of 一直以來都是我老婆想太多 (My wife has always been thinking too much)
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the affair in their translation, which is a crucial detail in the original text.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, it seems that you and your wife have something unhappy and do not get along well with your wife.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
在我們剛結婚的時候，我們確實過得很幸福、也很開心，但是呢後來的問題就開始出現了，因為我在台灣教的是葡萄牙文，那工作的時數不穩定，也沒辦法帶來穩定的收入，所以我們就開始出現了狀況。在此之後，我們針對就業工作這件事情，我們時不時的在爭吵同件事，她並不相信我的努力跟堅持，我也不知道如何讓他了解我所面對的挫折跟困難之處。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '在此之後，我們針對就業工作這件事情，我們時不時的在爭吵同件事'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'fighting' or 'arguing' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user left out the mention of 'frustration' and 'difficult situation' in the translation.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user used informal language in the translation, which does not match the original text's tone.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Well, let’s move back to your master program. Until now, do you still study in the master program? And when will you get the degree?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2016年四月開始讀這個碩士學位，那照理來說這個課程需要兩年，那原則上我應該在2017年五月完成。因為我一直沒有穩定的工作，所以沒有足夠時間唸書，所以我後來就放棄這個學位。正如我剛剛所說的，在我讀碩士學位的過程中，我的太太完全沒有支持我，我在讀書過程完全都是靠我自己，過程中我覺得很疲累、很挫折，我不知道該怎麼辦。
grammar and structure	tense errors	incorrect verb tense used

omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the mention of not having enough time to study
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the mention of becoming too tired and frustrated

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
you just mentioned the degree program… the period is two years, and you don’t complete the program, and I want to know the reason that you failed the program.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我沒辦法完成所有在課程上要求的作業，還有其中一些課程的要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
so in the last semester that you registered, and when did the semester end?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我在學註冊的最後一個學期，最後是在2017年春天。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
If all the things are just as you stated, the course should be end at May, 2017. And after you finished and stopped the program, you wouldn’t have any assignments. However, you still had text messages with your colleague after the course ends, and the period is for seven months, and what’s your explanation?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user incorrectly translated '課程結束後' as 'after the course ends' instead of 'after the end of the semester'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the semester ending in May, 2017.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
雖然我沒辦法完成我的碩士學位，但不代表我不想要改善我的中文能力，因此在我結束這個課程之後，我就靠自己想要改善我的中摁能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the phrase '在我結束這個課程之後' is incorrect. It should be '在結束這個課程之後我就靠自己想要改善我的中文能力。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'failed the program' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'study on my own' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So you mean even though you didn’t finish the master program, you still wants to improve your Chinese, and wants your Chinese become influent, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是為什麼我找我的女同事幫忙我。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation includes the gender of the colleague, which is not specified in the original text.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
so, … your colleague kind of plays the role of your tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
對我來說，她所扮演的角色並不單單只是家教，更是我的好朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' is placed incorrectly in the sentence.

你有付錢給她嗎
And did you pay money to your colleague for her teaching?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我有說想付她錢，可是她沒有接受
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If she is not your tutor, and you do not pay her money, why did she work so hard, and at midnight, is the time that she go to bed, she still sent the messages to you. And the content of the message seems to beyond the co-worker’s relationship.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user misinterpreted the original text and changed the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's sentence structure is incorrect and does not follow the proper word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted important details from the original text.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterpreted the cultural context of the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是我為什麼說她真的是我很好的朋友，他都會在空閑時間幫助我，協助我精進中文能力
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user's translation incorrectly refers to the friend as '他' (he) instead of '她' (she), which changes the gender of the friend.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Did you still teach English in the school?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的我現在還在那邊工作
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
And this colleague is still work in the school now?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'work' should be in the present tense to agree with the subject 'colleague'.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的，她現在也在那個地方工作，不過我們現在不是同事關係，也沒有一起合作到。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '不過我們現在不是同事關係，也沒有一起合作了。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
rosecutor, do you need to subpoena anyone that can help you investigate the case or investigate any evidence?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena the defendant’s colleague, Rong Er Huang. And I want her to act as an witness and help the court to clarify all situations and all the background and the purposes of these messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant's colleague's name, Rong Er Huang.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error. The correct word order should be 'I want to subpoena Rong Er Huang, the defendant's colleague.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the purpose of subpoenaing Rong Er Huang as a witness.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you want the prosecutor investigate any evidence for you?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard the cram school they worked in,… I heard that the cram school just took some action, and they intended to persuade the colleague Huang Rong Er to quit the job. So I want to confirm with the cram school and clarify the situation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated the phrase '美而美補習班' as 'the cram school they worked in' instead of 'Mei Er Mei cram school'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase 'the cram school they worked in' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb 'heard'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the action was taken by the cram school towards their relationship.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the action was an attempt to persuade Huang Rong Er to quit the job.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the user wants to confirm with the cram school and clarify the situation.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you want the court to investigate for you any further evidence? The current situation is that you have finished your master program in May, 2017. There is no reason that you make up reasons for finishing the assignments and sent messages with your colleague Huang Rong Er. And especially the time you two sent messages is almost after 9pm, it’s very possible for people to think there is a strange relationship between you and do you have any evidence that can help you clarify all the situation in this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And especially the time you two sent messages is almost after 9pm'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'it’s very possible for people to think there is a strange relationship between you' does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我實在想不到任何可以就我的立場幫我調查的事情。就如同我剛才所說，我們傳訊息這件事情非常簡單，只是單純我想要增進我的中文能力，然後我想要把中文學習的更好。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我實在想不到任何可以幫我調查的事情就我的立場。'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'improve my language ability' as '增進我的中文能力' is incorrect. It should be translated as '提升我的語言能力'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the communication being between the user's colleague and themselves.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the user's intention to continue learning Chinese.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next proceeding is set to held at 4:30pm on June 24th, in 2018. We will subpoena the witness, Huang Rong Er, and ask her. And the both party have the right to a lawyer. Do the both party understand all the procedure in this case?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'The next proceeding is set to held at 4:30pm on June 24th, in 2018.' It should be 'The next proceeding is set to be held at 4:30pm on June 24th, 2018.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that both the plaintiff and the defendant are required to attend the court proceeding.

 我明白。

Same by the file.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the…adultery case. The defendant wife accuse his husband Takayashi, for he find the intimate message in his husband’s cellphone. And his husband often find reasons for extra work, and moreover have the tele-conference with his co-workers, which is beyond the co-worker relationship. The defendant, your wife suspect you have an affair with other woman, what’s your plead?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong word choice in 'defendant wife accuse his husband'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	mismatched meaning in 'find reasons for extra work'
semantic conversion	omission of details	omission of 'from going to work' in 'find reasons for extra work'
semantic conversion	addition of unnecessary content	addition of 'with other woman' in 'suspect you have an affair with other woman'

Not guilty, of course.
當然無罪。

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today procedure, we are going to see the detail of the defendant and his co-worker’s message to see whether they have an affair that beyond the co-worker relationship.

I understand.
我了解了。

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
The accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have child?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'have you been married' instead of 'has you been married'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The question does not include the second part about having children, which is present in the original text.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
Me and my husband have been married for 4 years. We didn’t have any children.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'Me and my husband'.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Where did you get married? In Taiwan? Or in your husband’s country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met in Taiwan 4 years ago. He came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker is the one who wants to learn Portuguese, not the husband.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in a period between his jobs, is his job teaching Portuguese?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '過去幾年' as 'in a period between his jobs', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word 'So' at the beginning of the sentence, which is not grammatically correct.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he is a Portuguese teacher, and after we get married, he still teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so it is not stable in his teaching hours. There is a great period between his jobs for 1 or 2 months. After a while, he seeks for a stable job, so he tried to teach English. However, English is not his mother tongue, so he seek for an advance degree.
grammar and structure	tense errors	inconsistent verb tense usage
omission or addition	omitting important details	leaving out information about his decision to pursue an advanced degree

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mention that he seek for an advance degree. Do you mean that is a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that the person mentioned in the original text is seeking an advanced degree in Taiwan.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No. Because he want to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he need is an English teaching degree. He found a distance learning program in California. In that, he can have a distance learning in Taiwan, and he didn’t need to go to the America. After program, he can have the master degree, and he can teach English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'He found a distance learning program in California.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the distance learning program is provided by a university in California.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the program is completed through correspondence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the degree is a master's degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the degree is in English teaching.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the degree will help him find a teaching job in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship with he and his affair person?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'affair' is translated as '外遇' which means 'extramarital affair' instead of '關係' which means 'relationship'.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They were co-workers in his cram-school. They are partnered with my husband.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學' as 'They are partnered with my husband', which does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they are having an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '外遇' as 'affair' instead of 'having an affair'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I just notice that my husband often find reason for extra works in the school. And I don’t know why- it is a school and he need to have extra work….At the begging, I didn’t suspect him. However, in a few time, I found he will have phone call in the house, and when he responses the phone call, he will get into the study room. So I tried to check his phone.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And I don’t know why- it is a school and he need to have extra work….'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'find reason for extra works' should be 'find reasons to work extra' to convey the intended meaning.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the husband working at a language school.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation leaves out the wife's suspicion and her checking of the husband's phone.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
Did you see something strange in his phone
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'his' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
I found a phone in his phone book. So I check the message about that phone call, and I found there are many intimate messages.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even is the text it is okay…is the text no appropriate?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of the original meaning

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it is the regular text, that okay. But he is married, why a married person have intimate messages with other woman in his phone? I have some evidence in the file of the court.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of providing evidence to the court.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Exhibition 1 page 13, is this message from your phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the content of the text message.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的這些是在我手機裡的訊息。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
I would like to ask some question about this message. The first message was sent by number 0958-532123 on 9:50 p.m. December 21, 2017. It is the “ I really miss you, my love.” What that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '手機' as 'number' instead of 'mobile phone'.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封簡訊是我同事寄給我的，我記得當時我請了2天的假，所以他才發那一的簡訊給我，我的同事在美國讀書的所以思想比較開放，至於親愛的這個詞只是我們表達對朋友的稱呼。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural reference

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that the person who send the message was studied in foreign, so she has westernized and express her emotion open mind. So the word she send ‘my love’ didn’t mean nothing?
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the meaning of '我的愛' (my love) and assumes it has no special meaning.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
是的，那只是對她所關心的人都有的稱呼。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
Then what about the previous one?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the previous sentence in their translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我所說的，她只是很關心我而已，因為我當時請了2天的假，而我們是互相之間的夥伴。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you meant that she sent the message because you just didn’t go to school for two days?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對的就是那個意思，那簡訊沒什麼大不了的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'no big deal' as '沒什麼大不了的' does not accurately convey the meaning. '沒什麼大不了的' means 'not a big deal' or 'not a big deal at all', which implies that the message is not important. However, 'no big deal' in English means that something is not significant or not worth worrying about.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent on the 11:55, December 29th 2017, the context is “I want you to be my side, when can we be truly together?’ What’s that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳那簡訊給我是為了要告訴我要如何在中文句子中表達自己的情感。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So do you mean that she sent this message to help you with your homework? What was that meant?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我妻子所報告的，我正在攻讀一個碩士學位，而這個課程需要完成30學分，所以我自然會想要在平時所做練習。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you explain what’s your master degree study for?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的碩士學位是英語教學，它其中最主要包含了語文教學，那它也有部分是包含了文化以及語言能力的部分。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '碩士學位' is translated as 'master's degree' instead of 'program'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我的碩士學位是英語教學，其中最主要包含了語文教學，還有部分是包含了文化以及語言能力的部分。'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the program being a TESOL program.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So your program is a TESOL but it is include some cultural and language competence course?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'some' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user translated '文化溝通的課程' as 'cultural and language competence course', which does not convey the same level of formality as the original text.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得我至少選修了3門有關於跨文化溝通的課程。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what’s the assignment of these cultural courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'these' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通的課程作業對每個人都不太一樣，以我為例，因為我在台灣，所以我的課程作業的目標是需要增進我的中文語言能力。因此我的作業多半是中英句子的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation misinterprets the original text by stating that the assignments for culture and communication courses are different for every person, rather than every student.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation leaves out the mention of proving competence and having a good command of Chinese to reach the goal of becoming an English teacher.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation does not include the information that the assignments are about Chinese-English sentence translation.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So do you meant that those assignment for translate sentences in Chinese and English….have relationship with your tend teaching English in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，當然我也被要求了增進我的口說以及寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Then let’s focus on the sentence we mentioned. Is that your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的我記得當時我還不太理解一些中文句子的翻譯，所以我向我的同事請求幫忙，我把中文句子傳給她並希望她把它翻譯成英文句子給我看。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I asked my colleague to help me translate that sentence and send me the answer.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'I didn’t know how to say them in English' is not reflected in the translation.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
Do you meant that she sent that message because you ask her for translate it in English, and that message was the answer of your homework?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
沒錯那封簡訊只是我作業的答案而已。

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
That’s start in exhibition 1, page 14 to 16. Is all this message is for your assignment? I mean all the content of this message the answer of your homework?

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
對的這些簡訊都來自幫我完成作業的人。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the purpose of the messages, which is to complete assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then what’s your plead for you have an affair with the other woman.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我太太只是想太多了，我知道她對我目前分擔家計的能力不太滿意，而我也希望法院知道她從一開始就不太支持我攻讀這個碩士學位。她也不太願意對我的課程上有所幫助，所以我才只好找我的同事完成這些作業，所以我認為她應該為這件事情負責。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我太太只是想太多了' (My wife just thinks too much). The correct word order should be '我太太只是太多想了'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase '我知道她對我目前分擔家計的能力不太滿意' (I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family) is translated as 'I know she is not very satisfied with my current ability to share the family expenses'. The meaning of '分擔家計' (supporting the family) is not accurately conveyed.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your explanation, you don’t have a happy marriage life between you and your wife?

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
一開始我們相處得很愉快，但之後因為我的工作關係，因為我教葡萄牙文的關係，所以在台灣不太有穩定的工作時間，因此我的工作常常成了我們的爭吵議題，她不認為我真的盡了我的全力了而我也因此常常很受挫。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '因為我教葡萄牙文的關係' is incorrect. It should be '因為我教葡萄牙文的關係'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '我們相處得很愉快' which means 'we had a good time'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '我們的爭吵議題' which means 'the issue between us'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '我也因此常常很受挫' which means 'I often feel frustrated because of this'.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
Okay. Let’s go back to your program of your master degree. When did it start? Did you finish your program?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年的秋天開始我的碩士課程的，這課程本來應該是要在2017年的5月結束的，但我沒有完成它，因為我必須在工作及學位間做選擇，而這碩士學位影響了我的工作。就像我說的，我妻子從來就不支持我，而我感到很孤獨很沮喪；來攻讀這個學位，因此我覺得我非常的疲倦。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence '我是在2015年的秋天開始我的碩士課程的' is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我在2015年的秋天開始了我的碩士課程'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about working part-time and not having enough time to do course assignments, which is an important detail in the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user also omitted the information about feeling alone and frustrated while pursuing the degree.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '而這碩士學位影響了我的工作' which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user also added the phrase '來攻讀這個學位' which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase '因此我覺得我非常的疲倦' which is not present in the original text.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mention that the program is set for 2 years. Why didn’t you finish that?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我無法完成那些課堂作業，以及一些課程的必修。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'all' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So what is the last semester of your registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後註冊的一個學期是2017年的春天。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'semester' in their translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'registration' as '註冊' instead of '學期'.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As your mention, your program is finished on May 2017. However, you continual connect with your co-worker. How did you explain that you have the assignment after you finished the program?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the assignment.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
或許我沒完成那個學位，但這不代表說我不想精進我的中文能力，我依然非常想增進我的中文能力，因此我找同事來做這些練習。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我找同事來做這些練習' instead of '我依然非常想增進我的中文能力，因此我找同事來做這些練習。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
You mean that even if didn’t finish that program, you still want to learn Chinese by yourself?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
沒錯，那就是我找我同事幫忙的原因。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'colleague' in the translation.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the role of your colleague, co-worker is like your tutor, right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word 'co-worker' was translated as '家教' which means 'tutor', but it should be translated as '同事' which means 'colleague' or 'co-worker'.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是個家教，而是我真心的朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我原本想要的，但她拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我原本想要的，但她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you did not pay, why she response your answer in midnight when she is going to sleep? Is this relationship beyond your co-worker’s relationship?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The meaning of 'relationship' is not accurately conveyed.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not paying in the original text.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
就像我所說的，她是位非常支持我的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Do you still teaching English in that school?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'teaching' should be in the present continuous form 'are teaching' to match the subject 'you'.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的我還在那邊工作。

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is this colleague still works there?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'works' should be in the present tense to agree with the subject 'colleague'.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any person you want to ask, or some exhibition you want to show?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope to subpoena his colleague, 蓉兒黃, who works in 美而美 school. For the investigate the details, and background of those messages.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the colleague's name, 黃蓉兒, in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not include the purpose of subpoenaing the colleague as a witness.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the colleague's name, 蓉兒黃, after the verb 'subpoena' instead of before it.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'investigate' instead of 'explain' in relation to the details and background of the messages.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Accuser, did you need anything ant to investigate for?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court as the entity responsible for the investigation.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the美而美school have took some action for my husband and蓉兒黃for their relationship. And I would like to hear the explanation of the school.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user translated '美而美補習班' as '美而美school' instead of 'Mei Er Mei cram school'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事' as 'took some action for my husband and 蓉兒黃 for their relationship' instead of 'attempted to persuade Huang Rong to resign'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of wanting an explanation from the school.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The situation now is your program has ended in May 2017, and you don’t have any reason to contact with your colleague in December. And your message often sent in 9 p.m. It is weird for your relationship.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And your message often sent in 9 p.m.' It should be 'And your message is often sent at 9 p.m.'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '起人疑竇' as 'weird for your relationship.' The correct translation is 'raise suspicion.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the defendant's hope for the court to investigate evidence.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我並沒有任何法院需要調查的證據，就像我所說的，這些簡訊都只是我想用來增進中文能力的方法而已。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the communication being through text messages.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the phrase '就像我所說的' (as I said) in the wrong position in the sentence.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'the reason for the communication' as '這些簡訊都只是我想用來增進中文能力的方法而已' (these text messages are just a method for me to improve my Chinese language ability), which does not accurately convey the original meaning.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The court will have ask the details 4:30 p.m. June 24 2017…..
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order is incorrect. The correct sentence structure should be 'The court will ask for details at 4:30 p.m. on June 24, 2017.'

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.
我也明白了。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for an adultery case. The accuser’s name is Yu Han Wang. She accuses Edward who were in a cram school…She accuses because Edward not only has intimate message with his coworkers, but also find some reasons for working late in the cram school, also will have some tele-conferencing that is beyond their relationship of the coworkers. So, the accuser Yu Han Wang accuses Edward for adultery. The defendant, your wife sued you for adultery, what’s your plea?

grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing information

Not guilty, of course.
無罪
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation '無罪' means 'not guilty' which is a mismatched meaning. The original text 'Not guilty, of course.' implies a sense of certainty and emphasis on the innocence of the subject, while the translation lacks that emphasis.

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparation procedure, the court will focus on the intimate message and his coworkers. To understand whether it consists…constitute adultery case. Do you fully understand the procedure?

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First I want to ask the accuser, how many years have you and your husband married? Do you have children?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How many years have you and your husband been married?'

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for four years and we have none child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'we have' instead of 'we have'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that they don't have any children.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
And did you married with your husband in Taiwan or at the broad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
I met my husband in Taiwan for years ago. He came here to teach Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'four years ago' instead of 'for years ago'.

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the past four years, your husband’s job in Taiwan is teaching Portuguese?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
Before we met, he was a Portuguese teacher and after we married he is still teaching Portuguese. However, learning Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan so there are one or two months period between jobs that he didn’t have student to teach. In order to make the income more stable, he wants to learn English. However English is not his mother tongue so he spent more time on this language and study it… and seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'However, learning Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan so there are one or two months period between jobs that he didn’t have student to teach.' The correct word order should be: 'However, learning Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan, so there are one or two months of periods between jobs when he doesn't have students to teach.'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence: 'In order to make the income more stable, he wants to learn English.' The correct form should be: 'In order to make the income more stable, he wants to learn English.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the word 'not' in the sentence: 'However English is not his mother tongue so he spent more time on this language and study it… and seek an advanced degree.' The correct form should be: 'However, English is not his mother tongue so he spent more time on this language and did not study it... and seek an advanced degree.'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You have mentioned he decided to seek an advanced degree, is that mean he wants to study a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated '進修' as 'seek an advanced degree' instead of 'study further'

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, he wants to teach English in Taiwan so the degree he gets is about the English teaching. He found an online learning which was located in the California USA, so he can use this distance learning to finish his degree. So after that he finished online-leaning he can get the master degree of the USA. He can find a job to teach English in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'He found an online learning which was located in the California USA' should be 'He found an online learning located in California, USA'.
grammar and structure	tense errors	Tense error in the sentence: 'So after that he finished online-leaning he can get the master degree of the USA.' should be 'So after he finishes online learning, he can get a master's degree from the USA.'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of important details in the sentence: 'He can find a job to teach English in Taiwan.' The original text mentions that he hopes to find a job as an English teacher in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
What’s the relationship between the person he has an affair with?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
The cram school will have a Chinese teacher and a Western teacher and my husband and that girl are partners
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '補習班的同事' as 'my husband and that girl are partners', which does not accurately convey the meaning of colleagues in a cram school.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the arrangement of having a Chinese teacher and a Western teacher in the cram school.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user did not mention that the girl mentioned is the Chinese teacher in the class.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair with each other?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'they have' instead of 'they are having' to convey the ongoing action of the affair.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, he often work late, so I asked him why did you have to work late in an English cram school? He replied that he has a Chinese partner and they have to communicate with each other to talk about their teaching. At first I have no doubt about him, but ….for the time goes…after he went home he will get some phones and he will not answer the phone in front of me, but instead he will go to the study room. After that I checked his cellphone.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '美語補習班' as 'English cram school' instead of 'American English tutoring class'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the protagonist checked her husband's cellphone because of her suspicions.

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
What did you see in the cellphone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
After I checked his cellphone, I found that there is a same number in the phone book, so after that I checked his message and found that he send message with same woman almost every day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used 'send message with' instead of 'exchange messages with'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the fact that the user was curious about the content of the messages.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even they text with each other…it’s fine? Or the content is not proper?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
I also want it is not an appropriate text, but he was married but still send some intimate messages with that woman. I have provided some investigation messages in the file, maybe there are in the file.
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly translated the original text, resulting in a cultural transformation. The original text mentions that the person in question is married and sends intimate messages, but the user's translation does not convey this information accurately.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Let’s look at the investigation page 13. It’s about the message. The defendant, please look at the message. Are the messages you send to others?

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是地這些是我手機上的簡訊
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' at the beginning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the word '是地' (which means 'yes') at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the word '這些' (which means 'these').
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user translated the phrase '手機上的簡訊' (which means 'messages on my cell phone') too literally, without adapting it to the target language.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
And I want to ask some questions about the messages. The first message is sent at 9:50 on December twenty-first 2017, from the phone number 0958932123 to your cellphone. And the content of message is “I really miss you”. So what is this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'I really miss you' as 'I really miss you, my love', adding the term 'my love' which is not present in the original text.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封簡訊是我同事傳來的，那時候正好請…兩天沒有去上班，她是關心我，所以才傳這封簡訊，我的同事在美國受高等教育，她也是非常能接受新思想的人，至於說”my love”我的摯愛這個詞的話，是一種對關心的人表達的方式而已。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpretation of 'my love'

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
So what you mean is that your college is educated so she was westernized…so her…so…she will be more open-minded toward relationship. So “my dear love” is just a kind of concerning about you?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
那句話就是對老朋友表達關心的方式
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not capture the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
So how about the line?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the translation of the line.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就如同上面所述，她當時是非常擔心我，因為我們是工作上夥伴關係，她只是想要表達她的關心而已
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Since you have two days off the work, so she text you for…missing you to work each other and cooperate with each other and work, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對~那就是我想表達的意思，簡訊內其實沒甚麼大不了的
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was at 11:55 at night. It is on December 29th ,2017. And it is from the same cellphone… number of the cellphone. The message is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” So what’s this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳這封簡訊是要教我如何…用中文來表達…中文的一個作業
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the specific content of the assignment.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'express a Chinese sentence in my assignment'.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you have mentioned that she texts you this message is just to help you with this assignment? What’s this mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我老婆在庭前所說，碩士學位是需要修滿30學分，除此之外還需要完成許多作業與題目
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information about assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
 So would you please explain first, what’s the content of your master degree? What did you learn in it?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我是先英語教學的碩士學位，她除了包含英語教學以外，還有關文化、有些語文能力的訓練
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '先' is translated as 'first' instead of 'TESOL'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The word '碩士學位' is translated as 'master's degree' instead of 'program'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation does not mention the specific program name 'TESOL'.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user's translation includes the phrase '她除了包含英語教學以外' which is not present in the original text.
cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user's translation does not convey the appropriate level of formality or politeness.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you have achieved the master degree of TESOL… and your leaning has included the cross-cultural communication, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	Misinterpreting the meaning of 'cross-cultural communication'

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得三門課是有關文化與溝通的
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'at least' which changes the meaning of the sentence.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb '是' (to be) before the subject '我' (I), which is incorrect in Chinese grammar.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '記得' (remember) instead of '有關' (related to), which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what’s the assignment of the course of culture and communication?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'kind' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這門課的作業是因人而異的，舉一個例子，像我在台灣想成為英文老師，我是要展現對中文的能力，所以我的作業是以中英翻譯為主。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '像我在台灣想成為英文老師' instead of '我在台灣想成為英文老師像'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'To reach this goal and prove my competence' as '我是要展現對中文的能力' does not accurately convey the meaning. The original text implies that the speaker needs to show their competence in English, not Chinese.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of 'culture and communication courses' in the original text. The phrase '這門課的作業' does not specify the subject of the assignments.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean that you have to approve your Chinese ability. Due to the assignment, you have to translate many sentences into Chinese? Right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，除此之外還需要潤飾口說與寫作能力
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of being required to sharpen speaking and writing skills.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Let’s go back to the context of the message. You said it’s your assignment?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的，那是我作業的一部分，中文有許多困難的字，對初學外國人來講，所以我請求同事幫我翻譯再把答案傳給我。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the specific sentence that was translated.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The user used the word '作業' to translate 'sentence', which is incorrect.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used '有' before '許多困難的字', which is incorrect. It should be '有許多困難的字'.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user did not adapt the idiomatic expression '初學外國人' to the target language.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So what you have said is that you asked your colleges to translate sentences so she translated into then sended to you. Is this the situation at that time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
簡訊的內容就只是我作業中的部分而已
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the message was an answer to the homework.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
So let’s look at page 14 to 16 about the investigation. The defendant, so know you can see all the messages. Are they all for the assignments? Is that right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking help from the other person in the original text.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的這些簡訊都是為了尋求幫忙的內容
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'completing my assignments' as '尋求幫忙的內容', which means 'seeking help' instead of '完成我的作業' which means 'completing my assignments'.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So what’s your plea about your wife cused you having affair with colleague?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
對我認為我太太是想太多的，我也知道她可能認為我，對於支持這個機庭並不是那麼盡責，但當時我在完成碩士學位期間她也沒有給予任何幫助，因為她之前沒有給予任何幫助，所以我才會去尋求同事的幫忙，而她也要為此負責任…為這次的誤會負責任
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the wife's lack of support from the beginning of the study.

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your explanation, you have not a very good relationship with your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
我們開始的婚姻其實還蠻美好的，後來變質的原因為我工作的緣故，我是教葡萄牙，但是工作並不是那麼穩定，後來由於工作的議題有許多的爭吵，她認為我沒有盡力…對於工作沒有盡力而為，但我其實有許多挫折與苦衷是沒有說出來的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '我是教葡萄牙'
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'my employment' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'the two of us' in the translation
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the phrase 'my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced' in the translation
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	Addition of the phrase '對於工作沒有盡力而為' which is not present in the original text

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
So let’s go back to your master degree. When is your master degree? Has it ended? Have you gotten the master degree yet?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the question structure.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
這個碩士課程是在2015四月開始的，為期兩年，應該要在2017年的五月結束，然而我沒有完成碩士學位，因為當時兼職了…做了很多打工而沒有完成作業，就像我說的，我太太在碩士學位研習沒有給予任何的幫助，所以我覺得我是獨自一人奮鬥，奮鬥道非常的淚雨很大的挫折感。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'fall 2015' as '2015四月' which means 'April 2015' instead of '秋季2015' which means 'fall 2015'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the time phrase '在2015四月' before the verb '開始' instead of after it.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about working part-time and not having enough time to do course assignments.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling tired and frustrated.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the lack of support from their wife.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling like they were pursuing the degree alone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the degree program being a master's program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the intended completion date being May 2017.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about not finishing the program.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about doing course assignments.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the user's wife not being supportive.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling tired and frustrated.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling like they were pursuing the degree alone.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling tired and frustrated.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about feeling like they were pursuing the degree alone.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You have mentioned the degree lasted for two years, and you didn’t finished, why is that?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	incorrect verb form

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我無法完成所有的作業，還有課堂上的特定要求
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'also' which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
When was your last semester of your last registration?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我註冊最後一學期是2017年春天
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'registration' in their translation.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you have mentioned, your last semester of course ended at 2017, so it is no reason that you’ll have assignment after the semester, and your colleagues still send you the translation of the assignment seven months after your last semester?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the year when the last semester ended.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used the incorrect verb form 'send' instead of 'sent'.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
並不是我沒有完成學位就代表我不想精進中文的能力，在課程之後我仍然自學中文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '在課程之後我仍然自學中文。'

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
So what you mean is that even you didn’t get master degree, you still want to approve your Chinese ability, so you continue learning, is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，這就是我請同事幫助我的原因
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'Yes' at the beginning of the sentence, which changes the meaning of the response.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user translated 'that's why' as '這就是', which is a literal translation and does not convey the idiomatic meaning of the phrase.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So your colleagues played a role like a tutor?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不只是我的家教也是非常好的朋友
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay for her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
原本想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'I offered to pay her, but she declined.'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
So if you did not pay her the salaries，why did she have to send you messages at midnight? And this behavior is beyond co-worker’s relationship.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是我之前說她是非常持我的朋友，她花費自己的時間讓我英文更好
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'help me learn Chinese' as '讓我英文更好', which means 'make my English better', instead of '讓我學習中文', which means 'help me learn Chinese'.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Did you teach English at that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'still' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的我還是在那邊教書

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Is this colleagues work there also?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
她還在那邊工作，但我們已經不是合作得關係
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們已經不是合作得關係' instead of '但我們已經不是合作得關係'.

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have to…any person to subpoena or investigate any…
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I want to subpoena the colleagues of named Ron Er Huang and as a witness to tell the court what’s the purpose of the texts and explain the texts as well.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the colleague's name, Huang Rong Er, and the specific relationship between the colleague and the defendant.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the phrase 'colleagues of named Ron Er Huang'. It should be 'colleagues of Ron Er Huang'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation uses 'subpoena' instead of 'contact' or 'reach out to'. 'Subpoena' implies a legal order to appear in court, which may not be the intended meaning.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
Accuser, do you have anything to investigate, the court may help you?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the court's assistance in investigating evidence.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has put some actions about the relationship between two people, and also persuade the person to resign her job. So I want to investigate this evidence to prove it’s right or not.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '採取行動' as 'put some actions' instead of 'take actions'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb 'persuade' before the object 'the person', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the crucial information that the cram school is trying to persuade the woman to resign.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have anything to investigate the court may help you? As your master degree ended at 2016, so that’s an excuse of your interaction with your colleagues, by sending texts mostly after nine pm, that is doubtable… Do you want to provide any evidence to prove that…your…you are not guilty.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the defendant's interaction with Huang Rong'er.

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
對於庭上，我沒有想要庭上調查的事項，我們的關係真的是…很一般，我只是想要增進中文能力，並持續學中文而已
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
The next court is set at 16:30 on April, June 22nd 2018, for asking the witness of the procedure. And all of you, the defendant, the accuser have to participate the court and you can hire a lawyer. Do you fully understand?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	wrong date and month
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing year and misplacing month and day

 我明白。
I understand.

I understand, too.
我明白

今為 刑事庭 審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序
Today we are here for a criminal case. Case number 2345. Adultery case. Preparatory procedure.

通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯______，中華民國107年5月21日。」

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase '準備程序為通譯' which means 'as an interpreter in the preparation process'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used 'I promise' instead of 'I am here today' which does not match the original subject-verb agreement.
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The user did not include a comma after 'In the case of deliberately making false interpretation'.

如起訴書所載。
As stated on the indictment.

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

Not guilty, of course.
無罪答辯，當然
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '當然，無罪答辯。'

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory procedure, we are going to ask the defendant the detail of his conversation with his coworker. So that we could determine  whether the defendant has committed the crime of adultery.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'whether the defendant has committed the crime of adultery' instead of 'whether the defendant has committed the crime of adultery.'

我明白
I understand

I understand.
我了解

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, the accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have any kids?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	omission of details	The question is missing the word 'for' before 'how long'. It should be 'How long have you been married for to your husband?'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'you', so it should be 'How long have you been married to your husband?'
grammar and structure	missing or misplaced punctuation	The question should end with a question mark.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
Me and my husband have been married for 4 years. We do not have any children.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
Does you… do you marry with your husband in Taiwan? Or do you marry with your husband in foreign country?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the word 'you' before 'marry'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the word 'did' before 'you marry'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the word 'in' before 'foreign country'.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met 4 years age in Taiwan. He came to Taiwan primarily for teaching Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'We met in Taiwan 4 years ago.'

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So, in the previous years, his main job is teaching Portuguese, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, after we got married, he is still teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan. There are not many students waiting to learn Portuguese. So, his teaching hours is not that stable. Sometimes he wouldn’t have any classes for 1 or 2 months. After a while, he hoped that he could have a stable income. So he would like to teach English. However, English is not her native language. So he decides to go on further education and seeks for an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	he is still teaching Portuguese -> he is still teaching Portuguese
grammar and structure	agreement errors in number or gender	his teaching hours is not that stable -> his teaching hours are not that stable
grammar and structure	tense errors	Sometimes he wouldn’t have any classes for 1 or 2 months -> Sometimes he doesn't have any classes for 1 or 2 months
omission or addition	omitting important details	he hoped that he could have a stable income -> he hoped that he could have a stable income by teaching English
omission or addition	omitting important details	So he would like to teach English -> So he would like to teach English to have a stable income
omission or addition	omitting important details	So he decides to go on further education and seeks for an advanced degree -> So he decides to go on further education and seeks for an advanced degree in English

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
You just mentioned he would like to seek for an advanced degree. Do you mean that he would like to study a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	The user incorrectly assumes that '進修' means 'seeking an advanced degree' when it actually means 'taking further education or training'.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he would like to teach English in Taiwan, so he would need to have a TESOL degree. He found a distanced learning program in California, so he do not have to go to United States to earn a degree. After the online program, he could receive a master degree and he planned that after earning the degree, he could find a teaching job in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'so he do not have to go to United States to earn a degree.' It should be 'so he does not have to go to the United States to earn a degree.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the specific degree the person needs to obtain: TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages).

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
Then, what’s his relationship with this so-called adultery…adultery person?
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	adultery person

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They were colleague in cram school. Because in that cram school, they offer teacher both in Chinese and foreign country. They are partners.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How do you know that they are committing adultery?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I discoverer that my husband start to work late and I ask him why he work late so often. It’s merely a cram school. He said that because he has to partner with the Chinese teacher, there are a lot of issues for them to communicate about. In the beginning, I don’t have any doubts on him. However, after a while, I discovered that when he arrived home, there are a lot of phone calls. And he always receive the phone calls in a private space such as his study room. And do not want me to know what he is talking about. So that I begin to suspect him.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'At first, I discoverer that my husband start to work late'
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	Incorrect word choice: 'It’s merely a cram school' should be 'It's just a language school'
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error: 'because he has to partner' should be 'because he has to partner with'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning: 'there are a lot of issues for them to communicate about' should be 'there are a lot of things they need to communicate about'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'In the beginning, I don’t have any doubts on him'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of details: 'there are a lot of phone calls' should be 'he receives a lot of phone calls'
semantic conversion	omission of details	Omission of details: 'And he always receive the phone calls' should be 'And he always receives the phone calls'
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence: 'And do not want me to know what he is talking about'
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	Mismatched meaning: 'So that I begin to suspect him' should be 'So I started to suspect him'

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So, do you see any unusual messages in the phone?

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
There is a phone number that keep coming up all the time in his dialing record. And then I check his message box, I discovered that he has been messaging with the same girl all the time.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '通訊紀錄' as 'dialing record' instead of 'communication record'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed 'all the time' at the end of the sentence instead of after the verb 'keep coming up'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question is messaging with the same girl 'almost every day'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even is just texting… text message, it’s nothing. Are the text content inappropriate?
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting the tone and meaning of the original text

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
If it’s just regular texting, how come the text message is so intimate? Why a married person would text like that? I have submitted the text log to the court. I believe the contents are already in the folder.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Present Exhibit 1 page 13. The defendant, is this the message in your phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the content of the text messages.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這些是在我手機裡的訊息。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'cell phone' was translated as '手機' which is correct, but the word 'messages' was translated as '訊息' instead of '短信' which is the more common term used for text messages in Chinese.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then, I would like to ask some questions regarding these messages. The first message come from 9:50 P.M. 12/21, 2017 from the phone number 0958932123. The content of the message is “I really miss you, my love.” What does that even mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那封簡訊是我同事傳給我的。我記得那時我請了兩天的假，因為她有點擔心，才傳了那樣的簡訊，我的同事在美國受教育，他思想比較開放，而至於”親愛的”這個詞呢，只是我們表達我們對於我們關心的人的一種方法。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that because your coworker is more westernize so that she is more open-minded so that she expressed her emotion in that way. The word “my love” does not have any special meaning.
cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	misunderstanding the meaning of '我的愛'

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對的，這是好朋友之間或者是對關心的人所表達的一種方法。
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression used in the original text.

那她前面那句呢？
Then, what about the previous sentence?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the previous sentence in their translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，他只是比較擔心我而已，因為我當時請了兩天的假，而我們也是工作中非常要好的同事。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'she' as '他' which means 'he' instead of '她' which means 'she'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the adverbial phrase '就像我說的' at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the subject.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'naturally' which is important for conveying the speaker's intention.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
Do you mean that because you just took two day off and that she express her concern to you on the work?

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
對的，那就是情境。這個簡訊沒有什麼大不了的。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation of 'no big deal' as '沒有什麼大不了的' does not accurately convey the casual and dismissive tone of the original phrase.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message came from 11:55 P.M. 12/29 2017 from the same message, same cell phone, with the same number. The content is “ I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What was that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
他傳這個簡訊是告訴我如何用中文表達這樣的訊息。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '他傳這個簡訊告訴我如何用中文表達這樣的訊息。'

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that she sent this message is to help you with your own assignment. What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
正如我妻子所提到的，我正在修讀碩士學位，這個課程需要我完成30個學分，那麼當然的，這其中就包含了一些作業。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be 'As my wife has informed the court'.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you please explain what your master degree is about?

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程主要是跟英語教學有關，其中包含了語文教學還有部分是跟文化以及語言能力。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' instead of '計畫' or '方案'.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我的課程主要跟英語教學有關'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the information that the courses were part of a TESOL program.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So, you are study for TESOL program, and that the program constituted with some culture related courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'in' before 'the program' in the translation.
inappropriate cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misunderstood the meaning of '文化溝通' (cultural communication) and translated it as 'culture related courses'.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得我至少是有三門課是和跨文化及溝通有關的。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
What are the assignment for these so-called culture and communication courses?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'assignment' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
這些文化溝通的課程的作業會依個人而定，像比方說，因為我在台灣所以我的課程會需要我能擁有良好的中文能力。因此，我的課程有很多跟作業有很多是關於中文英文句子之間的翻譯。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of seeking a teaching position as an English teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'prove my competence' as '能擁有良好的中文能力' which means 'to have good Chinese language ability' instead of conveying the meaning of proving competence in English teaching.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'reaching the goal' in the translation.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'showing a good command of Chinese' in the translation.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'Chinese-English sentence translation' as '中文英文句子之間的翻譯' which means 'translation between Chinese and English sentences' instead of conveying the meaning of translating Chinese sentences into English.

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So, do you mean that your course require you to have some Chinese ability so that you have the assignment of translating Chinese and English. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
是的，沒有錯，當然，我也被要求要有精進我的口說以及聽力還有寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The verb '被要求' should come before the subject '我'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of 'listening skills' in their translation.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
Then, let’s go back to that sentence. You say this is your assignment, right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the user's translation is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
是的沒有錯。那個句子是我的作業。我記得我當時還不斷的理解一些中文字句的翻譯，所以我向我的同事請教。畢竟中文和英文的結構以及字非常不一樣。我把中文的句子傳給他，並且希望他能幫我把這個句子翻譯成英文。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
grammar and structure	tense errors	The tense of the verb 'translate' is incorrect in the translation.
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The translation does not adapt the idiomatic expression 'asked my colleague for help' to the target language.

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So do you...did you mean that you send the Chinese sentence to your coworker and the coworker help you translate it in English and send it to you? So the message is just only for homework. Is that right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

That message was only the answer to my homework.
是的，那個訊息僅僅是我作業的答案。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'only' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
Ok. Then let’s go to Exhibit one, page fourteen to sixteen. So, are these all messages for your homework? Please take a look.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the specific content of the messages on pages 14 to 16.

Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
是的，這些所有簡訊都是為了幫助我完成我的作業。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the messages were for completing assignments.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
Then, what’s your explanation toward your wife’s claim of you having an affair?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我的太太只是想太多了，我知道他對我不能協助分擔家計感到不滿。而我希望法院可以知道，他從一開始就不支持我工讀我的碩士學位。因為他不支持我，所以我才必須問我同事這些課程上的問題。所以我覺得，這個整起誤會的責任在他身上而不是我。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	misuse of pronouns

根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
According to your statement, there are some issue between your relationship with your wife?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
一開始我們相處得非常好，但之後因為我的工作遇到了一些問題，在台灣葡萄牙語的教學時間並不是非常穩定。因此我們的工作造成了我們之間一些爭吵的原因。他不認為我有付出足夠的努力來找工作。
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated 'she' as 'he'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The user used '他' (he) instead of '她' (she) to refer to the spouse.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of frustration and difficult situation faced by the speaker.

好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
OK. Let’s go back to your master degree program. So do you finish the program? Have you received the degree yet?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
我是在2015年的秋天開始了這個課程。這個課程為時兩年，我應該在2017年的五月取得了我的學位，但是我並沒有完成我的學位。因為我必須時常做兼職工作。因此這影響了我的我的讀書時間。就像我說的，我妻子並不支持我攻讀這個學位，我只能孤身一人的攻讀個學位，漸漸的我感到非常的勞累及挫折。
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence '因此這影響了我的我的讀書時間'.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	Subject-verb agreement error in the sentence '我只能孤身一人的攻讀個學位'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for not finishing the program, which is 'didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated, which is 'working part-time and not getting enough support from my wife'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for pursuing the degree alone, which is 'my wife has never been very supportive'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated, which is 'working part-time and not getting enough support from my wife'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated, which is 'working part-time and not getting enough support from my wife'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	Omission of the reason for feeling tired and frustrated, which is 'working part-time and not getting enough support from my wife'.

你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
You mentioned that the program is for two yearlong but you did not finish the program. Why...why did you do not complete your program
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
我無法完成所有的課堂作業以及一些課程的畢業要求。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'some' before 'course requirements', which changes the meaning of the sentence.

那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
So what… What’s your last registration date?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
我最後註冊的時間是2017年春天。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
As you stated, the last...the program finish on May 2017; however, you continue have texted message with your coworker. What do you explain that?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the seven-month period after the semester ended.

Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
我結束了我的課程，並不代表我放棄精進我的中文能力，我仍然非常想精進我的中文能力，所以我才持續的傳送這些訊息。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about sending messages.

你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
Are you saying that even you did not finish the program, you still want to enhance your Chinese ability?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
是的，因此我才會尋求我同事的協助。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
So the role of your colleague is like your tutor, correct?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
她不僅僅是我的家教，而且還是我一個好朋友。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word 'not' should come before the verb 'been'.

你有付錢給她嗎
Did you pay her?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
沒有，我原本想要付錢給他，但是他拒絕了。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '我原本想要付錢給她，但是她拒絕了。'

如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
If you did not pay her, then how come she reply your message in the middle of night? Does that has formed a relationship beyond merely coworker?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has incorrect word order.

That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
這就是為什麼我說他是一個非常支持我的朋友，他用他自己的時間來協助我學習中文。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word '他' (he) is used instead of '她' (she).
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order of the sentence is incorrect. It should be '我說她是一個非常支持我的朋友' (I said she was a very supportive friend).
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of learning Chinese, which is an important detail in the original text.

你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
Are you still teaching in that cram school?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'English' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

Yes, I am still working there.
是的我仍然在那裏工作

那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
Does this colleague still working there?
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'working' should be in the present continuous tense to match the subject 'colleague'.

She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
是的她仍然在那裏工作，但我們不再是工作上的搭檔
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be '但我們不再是工作上的搭檔，她仍然在那裏工作。'

請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
The prosecutor, do you have any evidence would like to investigate or would like to summon any other witness?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
I hope that we could summon the defendant’s colleague 蓉兒黃 to understand what’s her relationship with the defendant, and the content of the message.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the mention of the witness's occupation as an employee of the Meimei Tutorial Center.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user's translation has a word order error in the name of the witness, it should be '黃蓉兒' instead of '蓉兒黃'.

請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
The accuser, do you have any other evidence that you would like the court to help you investigate?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the accuser in their translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
I heard that the cram school has taken some actions between the relationships of my husband and 蓉兒黃. They even ask 蓉兒華 to leave her job. I would like the court to help me investigate whether this is true or not.

那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
The defendant, do you have any evidence that would like the court to help you investigate to? The situation now is that you have finished your master program in May 2017. So that it is highly unlikely that you ask your colleague to help you with your assignment. And also the text message were sent during midnight, this raise suspicious… a suspicion on your relationship with your coworker.

semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user mistranslated '簡訊互動' as 'text message'

I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
我並沒有任何證據希望法庭為我調查，就如我所說的，我和我的同事只是好朋友，這些簡訊只是我為了精進我的中文所傳送。

今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
Today we are here for the preparatory case of an adultery case. The accuser, Wang Yu Han. She filed the sue against the defendant, Edward Takayashi. The defendant was charged with having an intimate message with his employee in the cram school. And the accuser also found some intimate message through his cellphone while the defendant was having a night shift and also have a video tele-conferencing with ZonER- Huang. The defendant, you are charged by your wife of an adultery, what’s your plea?

在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
In today’s preparatory case, we are here to discuss….talk about the detail about the defendant and his employee of the…. We are having to discuss the.. whether the person has an affair with the others. Do you two understand?

是我瞭解了.

先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
First, the accuser, do you have the child with your husband?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
We have married for four years. But we don’t have the child.
grammar and structure	subject-verb agreement errors	The verb 'have' should agree with the subject 'we', so it should be 'have been married' instead of 'have married'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the information that the speaker is referring to her husband. It should be 'my husband and I' instead of just 'we'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user's translation omits the word 'the' before 'child'. It should be 'the child' instead of just 'child'.

那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
So, did you marry your husband in Taiwan, or abroad?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
We met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect. It should be 'Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.'

那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
So in the past years, does your husband teach Portuguese as his work?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '教葡萄牙文' as 'teach Portuguese', but it should be 'teach Portuguese language'.

我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
When we met the first time, he was a Portuguese teacher. And he has keep teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese isn’t a popular language in Taiwan, and…so the teaching hours are usually short, and there are periods between jobs. In order to earn a stable living, he started to learn English in Taiwan, since his mother tongue isn’t English, so he choose to seek an advanced degree.
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'And he has keep teaching Portuguese.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'after we got married' in the sentence 'And he has keep teaching Portuguese.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'for a more stable income' in the sentence 'In order to earn a stable living, he started to learn English in Taiwan.'
grammar and structure	word order errors	incorrect word order in the sentence 'since his mother tongue isn’t English, so he choose to seek an advanced degree.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	omission of the phrase 'in order to teach English' in the sentence 'since his mother tongue isn’t English, so he choose to seek an advanced degree.'

你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
Do you mean that he wants to earn a degree in Taiwan? And get a degree in Taiwan?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
No, because he wants to teach English. So the degree he gets is to …for English teaching. My husband found…that..found a distance learning program in California, it’s an online learning, he doesn’t need to go to there for learning. After he gets all the credits, then he can get a master degree. What he is planning is to have an American degree, so that he can has a qualification for English teaching in Taiwan.
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence 'So the degree he gets is to …for English teaching.'
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband wants to teach English in Taiwan.

omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband wants to have an American degree.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the husband wants to qualify for English teaching in Taiwan.

那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
So, what the relationship between the person he has an affair with this time?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
They are the co-workers in the cram school, there will be a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher, so they can cooperate with each other in the… in class. The person he has an affair with was a Chinese teacher.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '同事' as 'co-workers' instead of 'classmates'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about the 'cram school' and the arrangement of 'Chinese teacher and foreign teacher' in the original text.
omission or addition	adding unnecessary information	The user added the phrase 'so they can cooperate with each other in the... in class', which is not present in the original text.
omission or addition	inserting content not present in the original text	The user added the phrase 'The person he has an affair with' which is not present in the original text.

你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
How did you know they have an affair?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user translated '怎麼會知道' as 'How did you know' instead of 'How do you know'.

一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
At first, I was suspecting and ask him why he had to have a night shift after the school? Because it’s just an American cram school, and he has to cooperate with the Chinese teacher, so they had to have the further communication on teaching. At first, I didn’t suspect that… anything about him, but ….when he was having a phone call in….at home, he wouldn’t talk in front me, but he choose to talk through the phone in his… study room….instead.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	night shift instead of overtime
omission or addition	omitting important details	missing the suspicion and checking his phone

在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
So did you found anything strange in his cellphone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'find' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.

他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
And I checked through his phone book, and I saw there was a same number, then I checked his phone message, and I found that he was messaging with a girl he chatted every day.
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'chatted' is not an accurate translation for '通簡訊', which means 'texting' or 'messaging'.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the person in question was messaging with the girl 'almost every day'.

就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
Even though…. It was a…. Even though, texting messages is not..doesn’t have anything wrong or are there any something weird during the communication?
grammar and structure	word order errors	Incorrect word order in the sentence

如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
So it’s just a regular message, but however there are..they have some intimate messages between each other, and I have files some intimate messages to the court. Maybe it’s inside the file already.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
Please show the exhibit 1 of Page 13. The defendant, please see the content, are these the one on your phone?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the mention of the exhibit number and the specific page number.

Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
是的，這是我手機裡的訊息內容。
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'messages' in the translation, which is an important detail in the original text.

那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
Then, I will ask you some questions with these messages. The first message, it was sent at 9:50, December 21st, 2017, the phone number was 0958932123. It was sent to your… the message was sent to your cellphone, and it was written “I really miss you very much”, 我非常想念妳。….親愛的，我非常想念妳。 what does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
那是我同事…我同事發給我的，那天我請兩天的假，那是我朋友非常緊張有焦慮的事情。那是我…她是在美國接受教育的，所以她是一個非常開放，然後她思想開放，很勇於表達她自己想法的人，那封訊息內容，I really miss you so much, my love. 那只是她.. 我們互相表達關愛的方式。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural expression

你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
Do you mean that the girl was educated in foreign country? So she is westernized, and what she expressed is open-minded, and the message” I really miss you so much” is how she expressed her care?
minor categories of cultural transformation	misinterpreting cultural references or symbols	The user misinterprets the cultural reference of the girl being westernized and expressing her care openly.

No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
對阿。那是朋友之間表達關心的方式。或是更好朋友之間互相表達的關心
cultural transformation	failing to adapt idiomatic expressions to the target language	The user's translation does not accurately convey the idiomatic expression 'between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.'

那她前面那句呢？
So how about the previous message?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the previous message in their translation.

As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
就像我說的，她是來….她是傳簡訊來問我東西。我那天請兩天假，所以她有點想念我
semantic conversion	omission of details	The user omitted the information that the person in the original text was worried about the speaker.
grammar and structure	word order errors	The user placed the verb phrase '傳簡訊來問我東西' before the subject '她', resulting in incorrect word order.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information that the speaker and the person mentioned are partners at work.

你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
So you mean that …since you have seem just drop two days from your work, and she messaged you that she really missed you a lot. Which means she wanted you a help for her, is that right?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
是的，這就是那個..這內容所要表達的。那並沒有什麼。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
The second message was sent at 23:55. December 29th, 2017. And it was sent by the same person. The message was written” 我想要你在我旁邊，我們什麼時候可以在一起？” What does that mean?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original message.

She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
她傳的那則簡訊，是要問我說要怎麼在中文怎麼表達豐富的情感。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The translation omits the mention of the assignment.

你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
So you mean that she sent you the message just for…just asking help with her work?
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The user's translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
就像我之前跟法庭所說的，我現在有那個碩士學位要修，而且有30學分去完成這個學位。正常來說，我有功課，我一定有功課要做，所以這就是我當時我要所提問的問題
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the sentence is incorrect.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the information about completing assignments and exercises.

先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
Can you further explain, what are you studying in your Master program?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
我的課程是屬於英語教學，除了英語的教學之外，還有那個…文化上跟語言能力的課程。
semantic conversion	incorrect word choice	The word 'program' is translated as '課程' which means 'courses' instead of '節目' which means 'program'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'English teaching' is translated as '英語教學' which means 'teaching English' instead of '英語教育' which means 'English education'.
semantic conversion	mismatched meaning	The phrase 'culture and language competence' is translated as '文化上跟語言能力' which means 'culture and language ability' instead of '文化與語言能力' which means 'culture and language competence'.

所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
So you mean that you are getting a mater degree for TESOL, and there are some cultural communication inside the course right?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'getting' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the phrase 'for TESOL' in the translation, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
inappropriate cultural transformation	not conveying the appropriate level of formality or politeness	The user used a more informal tone in the translation by using 'you mean' instead of 'so you mean'.

Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
是的，我記得有至少三門課程是有關文化溝通的課程。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
So what are the assignments for the cultural and communication?
omission or addition	omitting important details	The user omitted the word 'course' in the translation.

The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
文化溝通不只是就是增加我的經驗之外，還有爭取教學的工作在台灣，除了當一個老師要有一個目標之外，還要一個有語言能力在中文上。所以我的作業有很多是有關中英上的翻譯。
semantic conversion	inappropriate cultural transformation	Misinterpretation of cultural context

你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
So you mean that you want to…you plan to teach English in Taiwan, but you have to get a master degree, and there are courses about Chinese. So the assignments you are assigned are translating the sentences right? In Chinese and English right?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
沒錯，我同時還要精進我的口說跟寫作能力。
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the translation is incorrect.

好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
So that go back to the words, are these your assignments?
grammar and structure	word order errors	The word order in the question is incorrect.

Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
對的。那的確是我的，我之前在學中文所翻譯到的句子。你知道吧，對外國人來說，有些中文句子的確很難分辨。那剛好那個句子我就請我同事翻成中文給我看….請她翻成英文給我看。然後再請她傳送我過來。

你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
So you mean that ask your colleague to send the message into English to you. And those sentences of messages in English was just your assignments?

That message was only the answer to my homework.

那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
So, what’s your explanation about the… about your wife filing the sue against you for…you are having an affair with other?

My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
我覺得太太真的有點對此太焦慮了。我知道她其實並沒有對我感到對我照顧這個家庭感到很滿意，從我一開始要唸碩士學位的時候，她就沒有支持我。如果在她一開始支持我的攻讀進修的話，我就不需要尋求我同事的幫忙了。所以她應該要為這一整件的誤會付起最大的責任吧。

At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
一開始我跟我太太結婚其實相處蠻愉快的，但問題出現在我要開始找工作，因為我當時要教葡萄牙文，但是我並沒有辦法拿到任何授課時數。所以因為這樣子我已經跟我太太吵了很多次了。她就是不相信我在這教學上做的努力，她也不知道我其實在教學上面臨了許多的挫折。

I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
