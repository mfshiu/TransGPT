I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
我去那裡接機，我有個朋友要來台灣旅遊。

  {
    "primary": "grammar and structure",
    "secondary": "word order errors",
    "reason": "The word order in the translation is incorrect. It should be '我有個朋友要來台灣旅遊，我去那裡接機。'"

所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
So you mean that you go to the terminal to pick up a friend?

Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.
恩對，我是搭車去機場的，然後因為我提早到了，所以我在那邊等待我朋友。

    "primary": "grammar and structure",

那為什麼後來會發生你拿原告帽子這件事呢?
So why do you steal the motorcycle cap from the people?
[
  {
    "primary": "semantic conversion",
    "secondary": "mismatched meaning",
    "reason": "The user's translation misinterprets the original text, changing the meaning from 'why did it happen' to 'why do you steal'"
  },
  {
    "primary": "grammar and structure",
    "secondary": "word order errors",
    "reason": "The user's translation has incorrect word order, placing 'the motorcycle cap' before 'steal'"
  }

I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.
因為我太早到了而我朋友的班機又會延遲，所以我覺得很無聊，才做了這件事。
[
  {
    "primary": "grammar and structure",
    "secondary": "word order errors",
    "reason": "The word order in the sentence is incorrect. The correct word order should be '因為我朋友的班機會延遲而我太早到了，所以我覺得很無聊，才做了這件事。'"
  },
  {
    "primary": "semantic conversion",
    "secondary": "mismatched meaning",
    "reason": "The meaning of 'waiting for my friend' is not accurately conveyed in the translation. It should be translated as '等待我的朋友' instead of '因為我太早到了'."
  },
  {
    "primary": "omission or addition",
    "secondary": "omitting important details",
    "reason": "The translation omits the information that the speaker went around to kill time. This detail is important for understanding the context of the sentence."
  }

你後來去了哪裡呢?
So where do you go latter?
[
  {
    "primary": "grammar and structure",
    "secondary": "word order errors",
    "reason": "The word order in the question is incorrect."

I went to the parking lot for motorcycles.
我去停車場找機車。
[
  {
    "primary": "grammar and structure",
    "secondary": "word order errors",
    "reason": "The word order is incorrect. It should be '我去機車停車場。'"
  }
]

然後發生了什麼事呢?
'What happen next'
[
  {
    "primary": "grammar and structure",
    "secondary": "word order errors",
    "reason": "The word order in the translation is incorrect."
  }

I saw a cap left on one motorcycle.
我看到一個機車上有一個安全帽。
[
  {
    "primary": "semantic conversion",
    "secondary": "mismatched meaning",
    "reason": "The user translated 'cap' as '安全帽' which means 'safety helmet' instead of '帽子' which means 'hat'."
  }
