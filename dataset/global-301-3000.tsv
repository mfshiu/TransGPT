en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著想要把傘還給陳小姐，但他不願意；我試著要跟他到道歉，他也不接受。也許我的老師和同學可以證明我所言屬實。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	 Okay, now I’m going to inquire Mr. Chen what happened on that day. Ms. Chen, can you state what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	When I went to the Yingge ceramics museum, it’s raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack. But when I got out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff in the museum to look for my umbrella for me but then I saw that foreigner put my umbrella back. When I found what’s on his hand was my umbrella I was so angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it’s raining outside? How could someone be so…

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	what’s the color of the umbrella you brought on that day? Did it have any feature on it?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	 The umbrella I brought that day was blue. I guess navy blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please show the investigatory record on page five. Is the umbrella on the picture yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	yes, it was this one.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	the umbrella on the picture was quite normal like the ones you can find in 7-11. How could you be sure that this one belongs to you?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, indeed. I bought this umbrella in 7-11. But my umbrella was broken a little bit at the place to close the umbrella. According to this point, I did explain to the police station about the button on the umbrella. The umbrella that the foreigner returned had the same characteristics as the one I had.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Will you consider to accept the defendant’s apology if he’s willing to apologize to you? After all, it’s only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	what do you mean “only” an umbrella? It’s something related to one’s basic ethics. If he didn’t return the umbrella on that day, he wants me to walk back in the pouring rain? I don’t want to accept his apology.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. We will send the subpoena to the three witnesses on that day and asked them to come to the court to state the process. The next court day is set at 3pm on June 19th in 2014. The defendant and the three witnesses will have to come to the court. The defendant, is this date okay for you?

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The plaintiff Ms. Chen, next court you can choose to come or not. Basically we just want to the defendant’s professor and his classmates. You can decide whether you want to come or not.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	Well, I don’t think so. I don’t want to ask for extra day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	On May twenty seventh, 2013, Mr. Anderson took Chen Xiao Qian’s umbrella in the Yingge ceramic museum. This incident happened when it is not informed Xiao Qian Chen. When  you tried to returned the umbrella, you were caught by Xiao Qian Chen. Therefore, she filed the case. Today procedure is to investigate what happened that day. Please answer my questions to help the court understand what happened that day.And after that, we’ll ask plaintiff what was happening on that day,do both party understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是,我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	Yes I understand

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	So defendant, what are you doing on 4:15 pm, May twenty seven, 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我那時是在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see plaintiff xiao qian Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	對，當我把傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐在那邊。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我大吼，然後說我偷了他的雨傘。我試著跟他解釋說，我一定是不小心拿錯的。我並沒有去偷他的傘，我嘗試跟他解釋，但他不肯聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	So why Miss Chen said you steal her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館參觀一個展覽。到我們結束參觀的時候，我的兩個同學說他們餓了。所以我們就到外面找食物吃，然後順便找找哪裡可以吃晚餐。當我在博物館裡的時候，我就發現外面正在下大雨了。因為我沒有帶傘，所以我就跟我同學借一把傘。因為我身形有點大，所以我決定從我朋友艾登那邊借了一支傘。他的身形跟我比較像。所以我就從傘架拿走一隻傘。然後我就去買一些麵包給我的教授和我的朋友。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我們大吼。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean that the umbrella you borrowed belong to your friend, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我那個時候是拿艾登的傘，我並沒有意圖想拿別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	So do you remember what kind of umbrella you took that day?the color and the shape?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我記得那個顏色，那個顏色是藍色的，而且整支傘看起來沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	如果我沒記錯的話，那應該整支都是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone proved what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	對，當我從博物館出來的時候，我的教授和我另外兩個同學可以幫我作證。我的教授甚至要借我他的雨傘。因為他的雨傘有點小，所以我沒有跟他借。我不想要讓他淋濕，況且其他兩個同學都在。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So all of them can come to the court and verified what you said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著嘗試跟陳小姐解釋說我沒有要偷傘，但是他不肯聽。我也試著跟他道歉但他就是不肯接收。或許我的教授和我兩個同學可以證實我講的話是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok now I am going to questioning Miss Chen what happened that day.Miss Chen, can you elaborate what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge ceramic museum that day.When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack.But when I came out, I found my umbrella was disappeared. I asked for the staffs in the museum to help me to find my umbrella.But when I came out the museum, I found a foreigner took my umbrella, and umbrella was in his hand. When I found that my umbrella was taken by that foreigner, I was very angry. So I yelled him, asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t him know that it was raining out there? How can……..

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Can you tell me what kind of umbrella you brought that day? Is there any feature?Like shape and color?

en-US	Actually,this kind of umbrella is quite common,you can be bought this kind of umbrella in many convenient stores like 7-11.How can you proved that it is belong to you?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought that umbrella in a 7-11. But there is a little problem on the button of the umbrella, so it can not be locked. At this point, when I filed the case to police,I have explain for them. The umbrella that foreigner put back have the same feature. So I pretty sure that it was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If defendant apologize,and want to reconcile…settle…..with him..

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it just an umbrella? It’s not only about an umbrella, it’s about…If him didn’t put back the umbrella, I may have to go back home without umbrella, and it’s raining. I don’t want to forgive hime.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	Defendant was stealing the plaintiff’s, Shiao-chien Chen’s umbrella on March 27th, 2014 when visiting Yinge Ceramics Museum. This incident happened without Miss Chen’s knowing. When you were going to turn back the umbrella, Shiao-chien Chen found that you took her umbrella. Therefore, she files the lawsuit. Today we are here for the procedure to know what happened that day. Please answer my questions to help the prosecutor make clear the whole case. Later I will ask questions to the plaintiff, do both of you understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我知道了

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, where were you at 4:15 PM, March 27th, 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see Miss Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的當我把散放回去傘架時 陳小姐就在旁邊

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened then?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大吼我偷了她的傘 我試著告訴她我一定是拿錯傘了 我真的沒有偷她傘啊我試著跟她道歉但她不聽我說。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	But why she accused that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和我一些同學去陶瓷博物館看展覽 我和我同學看完展覽之後 覺得餓了 所以我們決定出去找個地方吃東西 吃晚餐 當我們離開博物館時我發現下雨了 我沒有帶傘所以我想說可以跟同學借把傘 因為我人比較高比較大隻 所以想跟同學亞當借傘 他的身型跟我差不多 然後我從傘架拿了一把傘 我去買了一些麵包給教授和朋友 當我回去之後陳小姐開始對我大吼

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean the umbrella you borrowed was your friend’s, Adan’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的我真的以為那把傘是亞當的我真的沒有要拿別人的傘

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember what color and what shape of the umbrella you took that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得那把傘是藍色的而且沒有很新

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	So the whole umbrella is blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我印象中 是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone prove that you told is true?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	 可以啊我從博物館出來時我的教授跟其他同學都跟我在一起的 我的教授甚至想借我他的傘 但他的傘對我而言有點太小了 我不想讓他淋濕而且還有另外兩個同學

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So they three can prove that what you just told is true, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	 Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	 我試著想把傘還給陳小姐但她不拿 我也試著想要道歉但她也不接受 或許我的教授和同學能證明我剛剛說的都是真的

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	 Okay, now I’m going to ask Miss Chen what happened that day. Miss Chen, can you tell me what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and it was raining. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella into the umbrella rack. When I was out, I noticed that my umbrella was gone. I ask the museum to help me find my umbrella then I saw the foreigner put my umbrella back. It was the umbrella I lost. I was so angry that I ask him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he notice that was raining outside? Why he was so lack of morality?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Can you tell me what color you brought that day? Any specific charateristics?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought was blue, deep blue, I think.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	The evidence one, picture on page five. Is that your umbrella in the picture?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	 The umbrella in the picture is common in 7-11. Why can you sure that was your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought my umbrella at 7-11. But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella. Also I told the police as the explanation. The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I was sure that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So can you tell me if he is regret and willing to apologize, is there any possible to forgive him? Because it is just an umbrella?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	 What do you mean “it is just an umbrella?” It is about morality issue. If he didn’t put back the umbrella, should I have to get wet home? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	 Okay, I understand. We will subpoena to the three people that defendant just mentioned to clarify what defendant said is true or not. The next court date will be set at 3 PM, June 19th, 2014. Defendant and the other three people should show up. Defendant, is that fine with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的我會出席

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	 Plaintiff, Miss Chen, you don’t have to come to the next court. Basically, we will ask some questions to defendant’s classmates and professor. If you want to come, it is welcome.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No. I don’t want to take a one day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟我跟我同學去博物館看展覽。當我們看完的時候，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定去外面找地方吃東西。可是當我們要離開的時候，外面在下雨。我沒有帶傘，所以想跟我同學借把傘。但是我很高又很壯，我決定跟我朋友亞當借傘。她的身形跟我很像。所以我從傘架上拿了他的傘。我跟教授一起去買一些麵包。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大吼大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed on that day is Adan’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.

zh-TW	有阿，當我到博物館時，我的兩個同學跟教授都跟我在一起。我教授甚至要借我他的傘，但是因為它的傘太小了，我就沒拿了。我不想要教授淋濕。我其他兩個同學也在那。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?

I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天，我和一些同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看一個展覽。我們看完展後，兩個同學說他們肚子很餓。所以我們決定出去走走並且吃飯，再找找可以吃晚餐的地方。當我要離開博物館時，我發現在下雨了。我沒有帶傘所以我想要和我同學借傘。因為我比較高也比較壯，所以我決定要和我的同學艾登借傘，因為他的體型和我比較類似。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，然後和我的教授和同學去買麵包。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就對著我們大喊了。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean the umbrella that you borrow is your friend, Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對啊，我以為我拿的傘是艾登的，我沒有要偷別人的傘的意思。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember what color is the umbrella you took on that day? Or what kind of shape it is?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色是藍色的，而且樣式也比較舊。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	So the whole umbrella is blue in your memory?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我記憶中，的確是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anybody prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有啊，當我回到博物館時，我的教授和同學都跟我在一起，我的教授甚至提議說要借她的雨傘給我，但是因為她的傘比較小，所以我就沒有跟她借，我不想讓她淋濕，而另外兩個同學也是一樣的情況。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three people can come to the court and prove what you said, can they?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想應該可以吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	So is there any evidence you want the court to help you investigate?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我想把傘還給陳小姐，但她不想拿，我也試著跟她解釋，但是她不想聽，也許我的教授和同學都能來這幫我作證，證明我說的話是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK, now I want to ask some questions about what happen on that day to Ms.Chen. Ms.Chen, can you explain what happen on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to ceramics museum in Ying ge and that day was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. But when I was about to leave the museum, I found my umbrella was gone. So I ask the staff in the museum help me find my umbrella, then I saw this foreigner took my umbrella. When I noticed that the umbrella hold by the foreigner was mine, I was very angry so I ask him “ Why did you took my umbrella?” Don’t you know that it’s raining heavily outside? How can you not know?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	So what color is the umbrella you took on that day? If there any specialty?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella you took on that day was blue, I think it might be dark blue?

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the investigate file one, page five, the photo on the page. Is this umbrella on the photo, is this your umbrella?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the photo is very common in Taiwan, it is the umbrella that you can buy at any convenience store. How can you be so sure that this is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I buy my umbrella at the 7-11. However, my umbrella might be about to broken so it cannot be…together. About this point, I have explained to the police office on that day. And the umbrella was put back by the foreigner also have these features, from these points, it can be proved that this is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Can I ask you a question? If the plaintiff is regretful and he really wants to apologize to you, can you accept his apologize, after all, this is just an umbrella?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by saying “just an umbrella”? I think it is a question about where a person have the…..or not. If he did not put it back, I might get wet in the heavy rain. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Ok, I understand. So I will subpoena the three people mentioned by the plaintiff. I want them to come here and explain what happened on that day. Next we will meet here at 3p.m. June 19th, 2014. The witness and plaintiff have to come here. Plaintiff, can you come here on this date?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	沒問題，我可以到。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Defendant, Ms.Chen, you can come here at next court. Basically, next we will ask question on the day to the three person, I mean the plaintiff’s professor and his classmates. Whether you come here or not are okay.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I won’t come here because I have to ask for a day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Miss Chen?

zh-TW	有。當我把傘放回傘架的時候陳小姐就在那邊了。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我狂吼，說我偷了她的雨傘。我嘗試告訴她我不小心拿錯了，我並沒有偷她的雨傘。我嘗試向她道歉但她都不理我，她都不想聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why Miss Chen said you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟幾個同學去那邊看展覽。當我們參觀完以後我兩個同學說他們肚子餓了， 因此我們就決定出去找一些食物或者找晚餐的地點。 當我離開博物館的時候我發現正在下雨。 我沒有帶雨傘，所以我打算向同學借傘。 因為我有點高壯所以我想向我的同學Adam借雨傘，他的身形跟我差不多，所以我就從傘架拿一把傘。 我嘗試去買一些麵包給我的教授和我的朋友。 當我回來時就正是陳小姐對我吼叫的時候。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You said that the umbrella you borrowed is belonged to Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我想我借的就是亞當的。而且我沒有偷任何傘的意圖。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella which you borrowed on that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色。 它是藍色的，而且不是很新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is that the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	根據我的印象，顏色是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Who can prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	當然。 當我離開博物館的時候我的教授和我兩個同學都跟著我。 我的教授甚至想借我她的雨傘，但我教授的雨傘很小所以我就沒有拿了。 我不想讓我的教授和其他兩位同學被雨淋濕。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So your classmates and professor can come to the court to prove what you said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是的。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you need other evidence which the prosecutor can help for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我嘗試要把陳小姐的傘還她，但她不收。 我試著跟她道歉，但她完全不想接受。 也許我的教授跟我的同學可以證實我今天所說的話。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, now I want to ask Miss Chen what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you tell the details what happened on that day to us?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	It was raining and I went to The Yingge Ceramics Museum. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. After I left the museum， I found my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff of the museum to help me find my umbrella but the foreigner just came back and returned my umbrella. When I found he took my umbrella, I was so angry and asking him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? Who can do such a thing like that?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What the color and the shape of your umbrella which you took on that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	I took a blue umbrella, is deep blue on that day.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is a kind of common umbrella which can be bought easily in convenient store. How can you be sure that this umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought my umbrella in the convenient store. However, the button of my umbrella was broken. I can’t close my umbrella. When I tell the police, I mentioned this point to them. The umbrella which was returned by the foreigner has the same feature so I’m sure that he took my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	I want to ask you a question. If the defendant regrets and he wants to apologize to you can you forgive him and reach a settlement with him because it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? This is about the basic moral of people. If he didn’t return my umbrella, maybe I needed to walk in the rain to home. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	 Why did she say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天，我和我同學來這邊看一個展覽，當看完這個展覽之後，有兩同學說他們很餓，所以我們就一起出去買點吃的，然後找個地方吃晚餐，當我要準備離開博物館的時候，發現外面在下雨，因為我沒有帶傘，所以想跟其中一個同學借一把傘。因為我人高又魁，所以想跟其中一個叫亞當的同學借傘，我跟他體型比較像。所以就從傘架中拿了一把傘。我買一些麵包給同學和教授，當我回來的時候，就看到陳小姐對我大聲怒喊著。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you that the umbrella you borrow is belong to your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我以為我借的那把傘是我同學的，我沒有意思拿別人的傘

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Can you tell what’s color and shape you took at that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.

zh-TW	我印象中好像是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?

zh-TW	當出來的時候，我和我教授還有同學一同出來，我教授甚至願意借我傘，但他的傘實在太小，所以我沒跟他借，我不想教授因為我而淋雨，當時我有兩個同學在那。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, the three persons you just mention could prove what you said is true, is that right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著把這把傘還給他，但是他不願意。此外，我想道歉，但他也不願意接受。我想我同學和教授都可以證明我說所說的都是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK, Ms. Chen, let me ask you what happened at that day?Ms.Chen , could you explain what happened at that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and it was raining at that day. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. When I leave out, I found my umbrella was gone. I ask people in museum to look for my umbrella and later I found this foreigner took my umbrella. I was angry and asked him why did he take my umbrella. It was raining at that day. How could he so lack of …….

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Could you tell me what’s specific of umbrella and what’s color of umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took at that day is blue, I think it’s whole blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please see the file one on page five. Does the umbrella in the picture belongs to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it was mine

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	Actually, the blue umbrella you claim belongs to you is easy to buy in convenience store, how could you say that this umbrella belongs to you

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, my umbrella was bought in convenience store. The lock part of mu umbrella is little broken. I could not lock it up. I report this point when I reported to police. The umbrella which the foreigner took has the same specifics sot that I could say that the umbrella is mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	 Is it possible that you forgive the defendant? After all, he has the sense of regret.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it was just an umbrella? I think it should be public norm. If he did not return the umbrella to me, I have to come home with big rain? I do not want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

en-US	Ms. Chen, you don’t have to come to the court next time. Basically, the procedure of next court would be asking the three people and defendant what happened at that day. If you want, you can come.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	 The incident happened at May 27th, 2014 and the incident is that when the defendant visited the Yingge Museum, he took the plaintiff’s umbrella. This action happened without asking plaintiff’s permission. When the defendant wanted to give back the umbrella, the plaintiff found out this incident. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. Today our procedure is to clarify what happened at that day. Please answer my questions to help the prosecutors to know more about the detail. Later I will ask the plaintiff to know more about the incident. Do both of you understand this procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, where were you at 4:15 p.m. May 27th, 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff at that day?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	當我想把傘放回傘架的時候我有看到陳小姐。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大吼大叫，還說我偷了她的傘。我想要跟她說我只是拿錯傘了。我並沒有偷傘，我嘗試向她道歉但她並不接受。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why would the plaintiff say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	事發當天我和一些同學去看展覽。當我們看完展覽的時候，我有幾個同學說他們肚子餓。因此我們決定走出博物館找些東西吃，甚至是吃晚餐。當我要離開的時候，發現正在下雨。我忘記帶傘了，所以想要和我同學借。因為我長得比較高大，所以我想要跟亞當，我的同學，借傘，他的體型和我比較相近，所以我就從傘架拿了一支傘。我就和我的老師和同學一起去買麵包了。當我們回來的時候就是事發的經過了，陳小姐就開始對我大喊。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You said that the umbrella you took at that time belonged to your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	 對，我以為我當時拿的傘是我同學的，所以我並沒有偷傘的意思。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember what the shape is the umbrella and what color is?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得它是藍色的，而且不是很新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶中，應該是藍色的吧。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anybody can prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	 是的，當我走出博物館的時候，我和老師和同學在一起，我的老師甚至提議要借我傘。但她的傘比較小，所以我並沒有跟她借，因為不想要老師淋溼，然後還有其他兩個同學在，所以就跟別人借。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Can those three people come to the court as a witness to help you?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試圖把傘還她但她不接受，我也試圖跟她道歉，但她一樣不接受。可能我的老師跟同學可以證明我今天所說的都是實話吧。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	 I’m going to ask some questions to the plaintiff, Ms. Cheng. Ms. Cheng, can you describe what happened at that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went to the Yingge Museum and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack at the front door. When I was going to leave, I found out that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff to help me find my umbrella. And at that time, I saw this foreigner came back and put back my umbrella. When I found out that the umbrella he took was mine, I angrily asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining? How could he do that?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What was the color of the umbrella which you brought that day? Is there any feature?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day was blue. Specifically, dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the picture 5 in document 1. Is the umbrella in this picture your umbrella?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is quite plain. It’s just a normal umbrella that you can buy in a convenient store. How can you confirm this umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I just bought it in 7-11. However, my umbrella has a broken park, so I can recognize it. I have explained that to the police when I filed this case at the police station. The umbrella this foreigner put back shared the same feature, so I can say that it is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant regrets for his behavior and has the will to apologize, would you accept that? After all, the thing you lost is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	How could you say that it’s just an umbrella? It’s about the moral issue. If he didn’t put back, maybe I had went(gone) home in the heavy room. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	 I understand. We will subpoena those three people the defendant mentioned to the court as witnesses. Next court will be set at 3p.m., on June 19th, 2014. And the defendant and three of the witnesses should show up. Is this time okay for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會出席。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Plaintiff, the next court you may show up or not. Depends on you. Basically, we will ask some questions to the defendant and the witnesses, so if you wouldn’t show up is okay.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No I won’t come. I need to ask for a day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The defendant, Paul Anderson, took the plaintiff, Xiao-chien, Chen’s umbrella, and the incident happened on 27th, May, 2014, and the place is Yingge Ceramic museum. Such incident happened when the defendant didn’t keep the plaintiff… known. When the defendant wanted to return the umbrella, the plaintiff found out immediately, found out right at the moment that the defendant took her umbrella, as a result, she sued the case. We are here to understand what had happened at that day. Please answer what we I ask you, so that the police can understand what had happened at that day, do you understand? I’ll also question the plaintiff, ask her about what had happened at that time, do both parties understand the procedure.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	Yes I understand as well.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, where were you at 4:15 p.m. on May 27th, 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我那時候在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff at that time… Miss Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	當我把她的傘放到傘架的時候, 我看到她了

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我大吼大叫, 說我偷他的雨傘, 我試著告訴他說我一定是拿錯了, 我並沒有偷他的傘, 而且我還跟他道歉但他都不聽

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和我一些同學一起到博物館看展覽, 當我們看完展的時候, 有兩個朋友說肚子餓了, 所以我們決定出去外面找找東西吃, 也順便找找晚餐要吃什麼, 當我離開博物館的時候, 我發現下雨了. 我沒有帶傘, 所以我那時候要跟我朋友借, 因為我有點高而且蠻壯的, 所以我就決定跟我一個叫亞當的朋友借跟他借雨傘, 他的體型跟我比較像,所以我從傘架拿了一支傘, 我就跟我的教授和朋友買了麵包, 當我回來的時候就是陳小姐對我大吼大叫的時候了

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed is your friend’s, Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對我那時候以為那把傘是亞當的, 而且我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color, the size or the shape of the umbrella you took that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色, 是藍色的傘, 而且沒有很新

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella blue… wholly?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	就我記憶所及, 好像都是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone can testify for you

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有, 當我從博物館走出來的時候, 有一位教授和兩個朋友和我一起, 我的教授當時甚至說她可以借我她的傘, 但她的傘蠻小的所以我就沒有跟她借了, 我不想要我的教授淋濕, 而且我另外兩個朋友也在那裡.

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So these three can come to the court and verify for you, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是這樣的

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any other evidence you hope the police to help you to investingate?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著要把傘還給陳女士, 但她拒絕了, 我想要跟她道歉但她也不接受, 我想也許我的教授和我的朋友可以證明我今天說的都是真的

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, now I’ll question Miss chen about the incident happened at that day. Miss Chen, could you elaborate what had happened at that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to the Yingge ceramic museum, and it was raining. When I entered into the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack. When I came out, went out from the museum, I found my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff of the museum of to help me to find my umbrella, and at that time, I found the foreigner took my umbrella and put it back in the rack, When I found that the umbrella he took is mine, I was very angry and I questioned him, why did he take my umbrella? Didn’t he know it’s raining outside, how could he took other’s umbrella away?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	The umbrella you brought that day….What’s color is that?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	I brought a blue umbrella, I believe it’s more like a navy color.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the evidence, page no,5, is this umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, this is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the photo/ in the picture, is actually that kind which most people can buy from the 7-11, how could you be so confirmed that this umbrella belongs to you?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, my umbrella was bought from the 7-11, but the bottom of my umbrella is a little bit broken, out of order, it didn’t work very well, for this point, I’ve already told and explained to the police when I reported the case. The umbrella that the foreigner took and returned had the same problem on the umbrella, so I believe that’s my umbrella. 

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	May I ask you if the other party, the defendant, want to apologize and is very sorry about this, would you consider to forgive him? Since the thing you lost is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by only just an umbrella? It’s the issue about morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, what do you want me to do? Did I need to run in the rain and go home? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand, then we will subpoena the three people the defendant had mentioned and ask them to come to the court and ask them to verify for the case. The next court will be set on 6/19/2014, at 3 p.m., is that okay with you? And in addition, the three witness have to come as well.

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	好的我會到

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not to come for the next court. Basically, we will question the professor and the classmates of the defendant, if you want to come, it’s still ok.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I don’t want to come, if I have to come, I need to take a day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	Ok. I understand, the court is adjourned. Both parties please sign the record and then you can leave the court.

zh-TW	當天我跟一些同學去看展覽。看完展覽之後，我有兩個同學說肚子餓了。我們想要出來吃點東西，就是晚餐吧。我要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了。我沒有帶傘所以我想跟同學借一把。因為我人有點高大，所以我原本想跟亞當借傘。他的身形跟我比較像。所以我就從傘架拿一把傘，我跟教授跟朋友去買一些麵包。我回來，陳小姐就對我喊叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you used were adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我當時以為是亞當的，我並沒有想偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you specificly remember the color or the shape of the umbrella?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色是藍色的，而且不是很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	The whole umbrella was blue. Is that right?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	我現在回想起來，是藍色沒錯

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone who can prove your statement?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有，當我走出博物館的時候，我的教授和兩位朋友和我在一起。我教授甚至說要借我他的傘。因為他的傘有點小，所以我就沒有接受。我不想他的衣服濕掉，所以…

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So probably we can have three of them as a witness in the court. Right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想可以吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there anything that you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我想要還傘給陳小姐，但是他不接受。我想要跟他道歉，但是他也不願意聽進去。也許我的教授跟我朋友能證明我所說的都是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Then Ms. Chen I would like to ask you some questions. Ms chen could you describe the incident.

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to the Ying-ge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. As I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. However, when I was about to leave the museum, I found the umbrella disappeared. I asked the staff find the umbrella for me. Then I saw this foreigner who is carrying my umbrella. When I found that the umbrella that he was taking was mine, I was furious. Didn’t he know that it was raining. He didn’t have any empathy.

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Was there anything special on your umbrella? I mean, is there any marks?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella was blue, specificly dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please see the investigation file. Is the umbrella on the picture yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	This kind of umbrella can be bought in convenience stores, such as 7-11. How can you make sure that this umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought the umbrella at 7-11. And there’s some damage on the opening part. When I was at the police station, I told th police this point. And the umbrella also had the same trait. So I could say that that umbrella was actually mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So will you forgive him if he’s really regretful. I mean the incident is all an umbrella, which is not a big deal.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean not a big deal? It’s about empathy. If he hadnt returned the umbrella, I must have been wet and walked all the way home. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. So the court will supoena three friends of the defendant and ask them to come to the court to… The next court date will be on June 19th, 2014. Is this date okay with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	我可以

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Ms. Chen, you could choose to come to the court. Or if you don’t want to, that is okay. Basicly, we will ask the three supeonas questions. If you want to come, you’re welcome

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I would say no because I need to take one day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand, so the court ends here. Please sign on the investigatory record and you can go.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The time was 5/27 2013. In that time, the defendant took plaintiff’s umbrella in Yingge Ceramics Museum. The plaintiff was unknown with this case. When the defendant took the umbrella back, the plaintiff found what he did. So the plaintiff filed this case. Today’s procedure mainly understand what happened in that day. You have to answer my questions to make the prosecutor understand what happened in that day, do you understand? And I will ask the plaintiff what happened in that day. Do both parties understand this procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解了。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, at 4:15 PM on 5/27 2014, where were you in that day?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時正在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Hsio Chien Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，當我把傘還回傘架的時候，我有看到她。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened in that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她叫說我偷了她的傘。我試圖告訴她我只是拿錯了傘。我並沒有偷她的傘，我試圖向她道歉，但她還是大叫。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why would Hsio Chien Chen say that you steal her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和同學們去博物館參觀展覽，當我們結束參觀展覽之後我有兩個同學說他們餓了。於是我們決定出去找東西吃，那大概是在晚餐的時間。當我們正要離開的時候，我們發現外面正在下雨。我並沒有帶傘，所以我打算和我的同學借傘。因為我人比較高大，所以我決定跟我的同學借一把比較大的傘。因為他的體型跟我比較像。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，我和一些教授還有我的同學同行。當我回去時，陳小姐就對著我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean that the umbrella that you took is your friend, Adam’s? 

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	沒錯，我那時候就想說，那把傘是亞當的。我並沒有打算要偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color and shape that umbrella you took?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得那把傘是藍色的，但不是一把新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	So is only one color blue for the umbrella?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	就我所知，那把傘是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Do anyone can verify what you state?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	當然阿，我身邊有一些教授和兩位朋友。我的教授甚至跟我說，要借我一把傘。但是她的傘太小了，不適合我。我不想要她淋濕，我的另外兩外同學也在旁邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three people can make it to verify this situation for you, is that right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do any other … you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著還陳小姐傘，但她不想理我。我試著向她道歉，但她也不想理我。也許我的教授和我的朋友可以證實我今天所說的話。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Now, I am going to ask Ms. Chen what happened in that day. Ms. Chen, could you say what happened in that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	The day I went to Ying ge Ceramics Museum, it was a raining day. When I entered in the Museum, I put my umbrella in my umbrella rack. When I went out, I cannot find my umbrella. I asked the Museum’s officer to help me to look for the umbrella, and I found that the defendant out back my umbrella. When I found that he took my umbrella back, I was angry. And I asked him why he took my umbrella away. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How could he do that? So what’s the color of the umbrella you took in that day?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	And is any characteristic of that umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella that I took in that day is blue. Perhaps it’s deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now, we are going to show you investigatory file of page5. The umbrella in the photo is yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it’s mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the photo is a very common type. Anyone can buy it in the convenient store of 7-11. How could you know it was your umbrella? 

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought it in 7-11. However, my umbrella’s button was broken, so the button cannot be used. For this point, I explained it when I told to the police. The umbrella that he put back meets this characteristic, so I think it’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So would you forgive the defendant if he wants to regret and apologize for you?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	How can you say that? It’s about the basic moral. If he didn’t put the umbrella back, …. I wouldn’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

en-US	Plaintiff, Ms. Chen, you can make it if you want. We will manly ask the defendant’s classmates and professors, you can make it or not.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I wouldn’t make it.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. The court will dismiss here. Please sign the statement and leave the court.

zh-TW	那天我和我的同學去博物館看一場展覽。當我們看完展覽的時候，我的兩個同學說他們很餓，所以我們決定離開，去看看有沒有甚麼東西可以吃，所以我們就離開去找餐廳。當我離開博物館時，我發現下雨，我沒有帶傘，所以我打算跟我的同學借一把。因為我的體格比較高，所以我決定跟我的朋友Adam借傘。他和我的體格相近。然後我就雨傘架拿了一把雨傘。然後我打算去買一些麵包給我的教授和朋。當我們回來時，陳小姐看到我就對我大吼大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	That’s true; I bought my umbrella at the 7-11. But my umbrella has some flaws and it cannot be hold tidily. When I filed the case, I specifically described this feature to the police. The umbrella which was taken by the foreigner has the same feature. So, in other words, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant would like to apologize and show his regret, would you consider to settle the case with him?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it is just an umbrella? It is about ethics. If he did not put my umbrella back, did you mean that I need to go home in such rain? I do not want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	 I understand. Then we will subpoena the three person who was mentioned by the defendant to describe what happened on that day. The next court date will be on July 19th, 2014. Defendant and three witness will be show up, are you okay with this arrangement, defendant?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	可以我會到。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	 Ms. Chen, the next court date you can decide to come or not. The main purpose on that day will be to ask defendant’s professor classmates some questions about that day.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	Well won’t show up. I don’t want to take one day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. So the procedure ends here. Please leave after you sign the statement.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The incident happened in the Yigge Ceramic Museum on May 27, 2014. The defendant took the plaintiff’s umbrella. And the defendant didn’t inform the plaintiff. When you wanted to returned the umbrella, the plaintiff found that you took her umbrella. Therefore, she filed the case today we are going to understand what happened that day. Please answer my questions to let me…our….know what happened that day. After that, I will ask the plaintiff about the situation in that day. Do both parties know the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, where were you at 4:15 pm, on May 27, 2014.

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff at that day?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有,當我把雨傘放回傘架時,我有看到他

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	So what happened that day?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我咆嘯,並說我偷了她的傘,我是有告訴他我只是拿錯散而已,我真的沒有偷他的傘,我試著向他道歉,但他完全不聽

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did she say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	在那天我和我的同學去參觀博物館,當我看完展覽之後,我兩個同學說他們餓了,所以我們決定出去找東西吃,看看要吃什麼晚餐,當我要離開博物館的時候,我發現正在下噢,我沒有帶傘,所以我想要跟我的同學借,因為我人比較高大一點,所以我想要像我的同學-亞當借傘,因為他體型跟我很像,所以我就從傘架上拿了一把傘,所以我想去買一些麵包給我的教授和同學,當我回來的時候陳小姐就在那哩,開始對我大叫

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you took was your friend, Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的我當時認為那把傘就是亞當的,我當時並有想要偷任何人的

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the shape and the color of the umbrella you took that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得他是一把藍色的傘,而且不是一把新的傘

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	So the whole is blue…..so the whole umbrella is blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我記憶中那把傘就是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone prove your statement?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的當我離開博物館的時候我的教授跟我兩個同學都跟我一起,我的教授甚至說他要借我他的傘,但是因為他的傘實在太小了,所以我就沒有跟他拿,我不想要他被雨淋濕,而我也不想要另外兩個同學淋濕

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three can prove your statement for you or you can ask them to come to the court to prove, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想應該是可以

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	So do any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著把傘還他,但他不理我,我也試著向他道歉,但他也是完全不理睬我,或許我的教授跟同學可以為我佐證我說的話,也可以證明我那天的行為

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, let’s move on to Miss Chen. Miss Chen, Can you explain what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	In that day, I…. went to Yigge Ceramic Musem and it was a rainy day. I put my umbrella in. the umbrella rack before I went into the museum. But when I went out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the museum staff to help me to search my umbrella; finally, I found that the defendant took my umbrella. When I found that the umbrella he hold is my umbrella, I was very angry. I question………I said that didn’t you know that it was a rainy day, how can you………..

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	So what’s the shape your umbrella? Does it have any features?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	My umbrella must be blue. It is dark blue…it is a dark blue one.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now I’m going to show you a picture. In the file 1 ……….. Is that umbrella in the picture is yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it’s mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in that picture is very a common one which can buy in 7-11…in the convenience store. How can you sure that the umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought my umbrella in the convenience store. However, there is some defect on my umbrella, it cannot be attached…. closely. I was….I told to the police that feature when I go to the police station. The umbrella backed to the umbrella rack has same feature, so I sure that it is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So if the defendant is regrettable for this case. Do you want to settle this course? However, it is just a umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	Why do you mean “it is a umbrella?” It is concerned about morality. If he didn’t return my umbrella, should I went to home without umbrella? So I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. So we will subpoena the three people the defendant just mentioned to ask to explain what happened in that day. The next court set on the June 19, 2014. 3pm. Do both party can come to the court?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的我會來

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, it is your choice to come or not to come. Basically, we will ask the defendant’s professor and friends to understand the details in that day.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I don’t want to come because ……..

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. So the court dismissed here. Please sign the waiver here, after you sign that, you can leave. 

zh-TW	今為偷竊案件偵字1425號偵查程序
