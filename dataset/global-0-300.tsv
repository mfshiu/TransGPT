zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The incident happened on May 22nd, 2014, and the defendant, Mr. Anderson, took the umbrella of Ms.陳小倩, and the incident happened in Yingge Ceramics Museum. This incident happened without asking for the permission from the plaintiff. When the defendant returned the umbrella, Ms.陳小倩, found that behavior right on the scene. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. In today’s procedure, we would like to understand the details on that day. Please explain regarding my questions to help the prosecutor what happened on that day. Do you understand? And later, we will ask the plaintiff about what happened on that day. Do you understand the procedure? 

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我明白。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	And first, the defendant, where were you at 4:15 in the afternoon on May 27th, 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen, on that day?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，我把傘放回傘架時，有看到陳小姐。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	 And what happened then on that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大叫，說我偷了她的雨傘。我想要告訴她，我只是拿到錯的傘。我並沒有想要偷她的傘，我想要解釋，但她根本不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did Ms. Chen think that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟同學一起去博物館看一個展覽。當我們看完展覽，有兩位同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定去外面買東西吃，也許是在外面找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，外面正在下雨。我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟同學借一把傘。因為我有點高，又有點壯，就決定跟我ㄧ個同學Adam借把傘。他的體型跟我差不多。所以我從傘架中拿了一把傘。我跟我的老師，還有幾位同學一起去買麵包。我們回來的時候，陳小姐就看到我，並對我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed was actually Adam’s? 

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我以為那把傘是亞當的，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	 Do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you took on that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得那把傘的顏色，是藍色的，而且不是全新的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the entire umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象中，是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone who prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，我出博物館的時候，我是跟老師還有兩位同學一起的。我的老師也有提議要借我的傘，因為她的傘有點小，我並沒有拿。我不想要她被淋濕，然後也有兩位同學在旁邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Therefore, perhaps, the professor and those two classmates can come to the court to verify what you said is true.

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	也許是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any other evidence that you would like to ask the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我想要把傘還給陳小姐，但她不想拿；我也試圖想要道歉，但她根本不聽。我的老師跟同學也許可以證實，我說的是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK. Now, I would like to ask Ms. Chen about the detail of the incident on that day.Ms. Chen, could you please elaborate what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day, and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. However, when I came out form the museum, I found that my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff in the museum to help me find the umbrella, but I later saw putting my umbrella back. When I found that the umbrella he took was actually mine, I was actually very angry, and I asked him why he had taken my umbrella. It was raining at that time. How could he do that?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What color was the umbrella you took on that day, and is there any feature of the umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took on that day should have been blue, dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please show page five on the file one. Is that the umbrella belonging to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this photo is common, and people can buy such an umbrella even at a 7-11. How could you verify that is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Actually, I did buy my umbrella at a 7-11. However, the button on my umbrella is a little broken; therefore, it is hard to buckle it up. In terms of this, I have especially talked about it when I made my record at the police station. And the umbrella, which the foreigner put back to the umbrella rack, also had this feature; therefore, it can be proven that the umbrella is mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant regrets and he is willing to apologize, would you like to forgive him? After all, what you missed was an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	It is not about what I missed was an umbrella. It is about one’s personality. If he had not taken the umbrella back on that day, I would be totally wet when I got home on that day. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	 Yes, I understand. And the court will subpoena those three witnesses to the court to testimony what happened on that day. The next court date is set on June 19th, 2014. Is that okay for you on that day, the defendant?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Ms. Chen, you can decide whether to come on the next court date. On the next court date, we will mainly ask the professor and the two fellows on that day. 

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	It doesn’t matter; otherwise, I have to take a leave from my job.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand, and today’s court is dismissed. And the two parties sign on today’s records, and you may leave.

zh-TW	他對著我大吼，說我偷她雨傘。我試著跟他說我只是拿錯雨傘了，我根本沒偷她雨傘，我試著跟他道歉，但他不想聽我說。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	So why did Ms. Chen say you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

zh-TW	在當天我和一些同學到博物館裡面參觀一些展覽，當我們看完參展的物件之後，有個同學說他肚子餓，我們想說要找些東西吃，然後可能找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，我發現當時正在下雨。我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想說跟我ㄧ個同學借。因為我又高又壯，所以想說跟我ㄧ個叫亞當的同學借，他體型跟我比較相似。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，我和我的教授去買了一些麵包，和我的一些同學。當我們回來的時候，就是陳小姐對我大吼的時候。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed belonged to your classmate Adam?
