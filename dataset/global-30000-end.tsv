zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The incident happened on May 22nd, 2014, and the defendant, Mr. Anderson, took the umbrella of Ms.陳小倩, and the incident happened in Yingge Ceramics Museum. This incident happened without asking for the permission from the plaintiff. When the defendant returned the umbrella, Ms.陳小倩, found that behavior right on the scene. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. In today’s procedure, we would like to understand the details on that day. Please explain regarding my questions to help the prosecutor what happened on that day. Do you understand? And later, we will ask the plaintiff about what happened on that day. Do you understand the procedure? 

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我明白。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	And first, the defendant, where were you at 4:15 in the afternoon on May 27th, 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen, on that day?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，我把傘放回傘架時，有看到陳小姐。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	 And what happened then on that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大叫，說我偷了她的雨傘。我想要告訴她，我只是拿到錯的傘。我並沒有想要偷她的傘，我想要解釋，但她根本不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did Ms. Chen think that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟同學一起去博物館看一個展覽。當我們看完展覽，有兩位同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定去外面買東西吃，也許是在外面找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，外面正在下雨。我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟同學借一把傘。因為我有點高，又有點壯，就決定跟我ㄧ個同學Adam借把傘。他的體型跟我差不多。所以我從傘架中拿了一把傘。我跟我的老師，還有幾位同學一起去買麵包。我們回來的時候，陳小姐就看到我，並對我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed was actually Adam’s? 

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我以為那把傘是亞當的，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	 Do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you took on that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得那把傘的顏色，是藍色的，而且不是全新的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the entire umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象中，是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone who prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，我出博物館的時候，我是跟老師還有兩位同學一起的。我的老師也有提議要借我的傘，因為她的傘有點小，我並沒有拿。我不想要她被淋濕，然後也有兩位同學在旁邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Therefore, perhaps, the professor and those two classmates can come to the court to verify what you said is true.

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	也許是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any other evidence that you would like to ask the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我想要把傘還給陳小姐，但她不想拿；我也試圖想要道歉，但她根本不聽。我的老師跟同學也許可以證實，我說的是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK. Now, I would like to ask Ms. Chen about the detail of the incident on that day.Ms. Chen, could you please elaborate what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day, and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. However, when I came out form the museum, I found that my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff in the museum to help me find the umbrella, but I later saw putting my umbrella back. When I found that the umbrella he took was actually mine, I was actually very angry, and I asked him why he had taken my umbrella. It was raining at that time. How could he do that?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What color was the umbrella you took on that day, and is there any feature of the umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took on that day should have been blue, dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please show page five on the file one. Is that the umbrella belonging to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this photo is common, and people can buy such an umbrella even at a 7-11. How could you verify that is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Actually, I did buy my umbrella at a 7-11. However, the button on my umbrella is a little broken; therefore, it is hard to buckle it up. In terms of this, I have especially talked about it when I made my record at the police station. And the umbrella, which the foreigner put back to the umbrella rack, also had this feature; therefore, it can be proven that the umbrella is mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant regrets and he is willing to apologize, would you like to forgive him? After all, what you missed was an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	It is not about what I missed was an umbrella. It is about one’s personality. If he had not taken the umbrella back on that day, I would be totally wet when I got home on that day. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	 Yes, I understand. And the court will subpoena those three witnesses to the court to testimony what happened on that day. The next court date is set on June 19th, 2014. Is that okay for you on that day, the defendant?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Ms. Chen, you can decide whether to come on the next court date. On the next court date, we will mainly ask the professor and the two fellows on that day. 

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	It doesn’t matter; otherwise, I have to take a leave from my job.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand, and today’s court is dismissed. And the two parties sign on today’s records, and you may leave.

en-US	The defendant Paul Anderson was accused of stealing the umbrella of Shiao Chien Chen in Yingge Ceramics Museum. This action wasn’t aware by the plaintiff. When you were about to return the umbrella, you were caught by Shiao Chien Chen with the umbrella. Therefore she decided to file this case. Today’s procedure is mainly set to figure out what happened on this day. Please answer my questions so that we can figure out what happened on this day. Do you understand? Later on, I will also question the plaintiff. Do both parties understand the procedure?

en-US	I have a question for the defendant. Where were you at 4:15pm on May 27th in 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	did you see the plaintiff Ms. Chen on that time?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	對，當我要把雨傘放回去的時候，陳小姐就在那

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對著我大吼，說我偷她雨傘。我試著跟他說我只是拿錯雨傘了，我根本沒偷她雨傘，我試著跟他道歉，但他不想聽我說。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	So why did Ms. Chen say you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	在當天我和一些同學到博物館裡面參觀一些展覽，當我們看完參展的物件之後，有個同學說他肚子餓，我們想說要找些東西吃，然後可能找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，我發現當時正在下雨。我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想說跟我ㄧ個同學借。因為我又高又壯，所以想說跟我ㄧ個叫亞當的同學借，他體型跟我比較相似。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，我和我的教授去買了一些麵包，和我的一些同學。當我們回來的時候，就是陳小姐對我大吼的時候。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed belonged to your classmate Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對我覺得那是我同學亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	do you remember what’s the shape and color of the umbrella you took on that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，印象中是藍色的，不是很新

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	so was the whole umbrella in blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	我印象中是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	can anyone verify what you just said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	對當時我走出博物館的時候，我的兩個同學還有老師都和我在一起。我老師甚至還想要借我雨傘，因為他的傘太小了所以我沒有跟他拿，我不想他被淋濕，還有其他兩位同學在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	These three people can manage to come to the court right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	do you have any further evidence that want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著想要把傘還給陳小姐，但他不願意；我試著要跟他到道歉，他也不接受。也許我的老師和同學可以證明我所言屬實。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	 Okay, now I’m going to inquire Mr. Chen what happened on that day. Ms. Chen, can you state what happened on that day?

en-US	When I went to the Yingge ceramics museum, it’s raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack. But when I got out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff in the museum to look for my umbrella for me but then I saw that foreigner put my umbrella back. When I found what’s on his hand was my umbrella I was so angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it’s raining outside? How could someone be so…

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	what’s the color of the umbrella you brought on that day? Did it have any feature on it?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	 The umbrella I brought that day was blue. I guess navy blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please show the investigatory record on page five. Is the umbrella on the picture yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	yes, it was this one.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	the umbrella on the picture was quite normal like the ones you can find in 7-11. How could you be sure that this one belongs to you?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, indeed. I bought this umbrella in 7-11. But my umbrella was broken a little bit at the place to close the umbrella. According to this point, I did explain to the police station about the button on the umbrella. The umbrella that the foreigner returned had the same characteristics as the one I had.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Will you consider to accept the defendant’s apology if he’s willing to apologize to you? After all, it’s only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	what do you mean “only” an umbrella? It’s something related to one’s basic ethics. If he didn’t return the umbrella on that day, he wants me to walk back in the pouring rain? I don’t want to accept his apology.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

en-US	Did you see plaintiff xiao qian Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	對，當我把傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐在那邊。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我大吼，然後說我偷了他的雨傘。我試著跟他解釋說，我一定是不小心拿錯的。我並沒有去偷他的傘，我嘗試跟他解釋，但他不肯聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	So why Miss Chen said you steal her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館參觀一個展覽。到我們結束參觀的時候，我的兩個同學說他們餓了。所以我們就到外面找食物吃，然後順便找找哪裡可以吃晚餐。當我在博物館裡的時候，我就發現外面正在下大雨了。因為我沒有帶傘，所以我就跟我同學借一把傘。因為我身形有點大，所以我決定從我朋友艾登那邊借了一支傘。他的身形跟我比較像。所以我就從傘架拿走一隻傘。然後我就去買一些麵包給我的教授和我的朋友。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我們大吼。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean that the umbrella you borrowed belong to your friend, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我那個時候是拿艾登的傘，我並沒有意圖想拿別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	So do you remember what kind of umbrella you took that day?the color and the shape?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我記得那個顏色，那個顏色是藍色的，而且整支傘看起來沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	如果我沒記錯的話，那應該整支都是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone proved what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	對，當我從博物館出來的時候，我的教授和我另外兩個同學可以幫我作證。我的教授甚至要借我他的雨傘。因為他的雨傘有點小，所以我沒有跟他借。我不想要讓他淋濕，況且其他兩個同學都在。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So all of them can come to the court and verified what you said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著嘗試跟陳小姐解釋說我沒有要偷傘，但是他不肯聽。我也試著跟他道歉但他就是不肯接收。或許我的教授和我兩個同學可以證實我講的話是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok now I am going to questioning Miss Chen what happened that day.Miss Chen, can you elaborate what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge ceramic museum that day.When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack.But when I came out, I found my umbrella was disappeared. I asked for the staffs in the museum to help me to find my umbrella.But when I came out the museum, I found a foreigner took my umbrella, and umbrella was in his hand. When I found that my umbrella was taken by that foreigner, I was very angry. So I yelled him, asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t him know that it was raining out there? How can……..

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Can you tell me what kind of umbrella you brought that day? Is there any feature?Like shape and color?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took that day was blue, deep blue one.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please see the investigate file, is that umbrella in the picture belongs to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	Actually,this kind of umbrella is quite common,you can be bought this kind of umbrella in many convenient stores like 7-11.How can you proved that it is belong to you?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought that umbrella in a 7-11. But there is a little problem on the button of the umbrella, so it can not be locked. At this point, when I filed the case to police,I have explain for them. The umbrella that foreigner put back have the same feature. So I pretty sure that it was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If defendant apologize,and want to reconcile…settle…..with him..

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it just an umbrella? It’s not only about an umbrella, it’s about…If him didn’t put back the umbrella, I may have to go back home without umbrella, and it’s raining. I don’t want to forgive hime.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Okay, I understand. So we will subpoena all of the three witness and defendant to the court.The next court will be on 3 pm, June nineteenth, 2014.All of the witness and defendant should have to come to the court. Do you understand, defendant?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是，我會準時到場。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, the next court, you may come or not to come to the court.Basically we are going to questioning the witness, which are his classmate, and his professor.So you may choose to come or not to come.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。

en-US	I went to Yinge ceramics museum that day, and it was raining. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack out there. When I came out, my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff of the museum to find the umbrella for me, and then I found out that the foreigner took my umbrella.

en-US	Indeed, I bought that umbrella at 7-11. But the button of my umbrella was a little bit broken, so it couldn’t be buckled up. I explained this to the police when I called them. The one the foreigner put back had the same situation, from this, I could tell that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If he is regretful and willing to apologize, is it possible that you could forgive him? After all, it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by “just an umbrella?” it’s about a person’s virtue. If he didn’t take back that day, didn’t I have to go home in the rain? I don’t want to forgive him.

en-US	 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and it was raining. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella into the umbrella rack. When I was out, I noticed that my umbrella was gone. I ask the museum to help me find my umbrella then I saw the foreigner put my umbrella back. It was the umbrella I lost. I was so angry that I ask him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he notice that was raining outside? Why he was so lack of morality?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Can you tell me what color you brought that day? Any specific charateristics?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought was blue, deep blue, I think.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	The evidence one, picture on page five. Is that your umbrella in the picture?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	 The umbrella in the picture is common in 7-11. Why can you sure that was your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought my umbrella at 7-11. But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella. Also I told the police as the explanation. The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I was sure that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So can you tell me if he is regret and willing to apologize, is there any possible to forgive him? Because it is just an umbrella?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	 What do you mean “it is just an umbrella?” It is about morality issue. If he didn’t put back the umbrella, should I have to get wet home? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	 Okay, I understand. We will subpoena to the three people that defendant just mentioned to clarify what defendant said is true or not. The next court date will be set at 3 PM, June 19th, 2014. Defendant and the other three people should show up. Defendant, is that fine with you?

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	 Plaintiff, Miss Chen, you don’t have to come to the next court. Basically, we will ask some questions to defendant’s classmates and professor. If you want to come, it is welcome.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No. I don’t want to take a one day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	Paul Anderson, on May 27th 2014, when you went to Ying ge Ceramics Museum, you took Miss Chen’s umbrella. The situation is that you didn’t tell the plaintiff, and when you give back the umbrella, Miss Chen found out that you stole her umbrella. Then she sued you of stealing. Today’s purpose is to understand the details of that day. Please answer my question to help the police to understand the situation. Later, I will ask the plaintiff, Miss Chen, some details of that day. Do both parties understand the procedure? 

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, at 4:15 p.m. on May 27th 2014, where was you?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see Miss Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有阿，當我把傘放回傘價的時候。她就在那了。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我大叫說我偷了他的傘。我試著要告訴他我拿錯把了，我沒有偷他的傘。可是他根本不聽我說。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why Miss Chen still insist that you steal her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟我跟我同學去博物館看展覽。當我們看完的時候，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定去外面找地方吃東西。可是當我們要離開的時候，外面在下雨。我沒有帶傘，所以想跟我同學借把傘。但是我很高又很壯，我決定跟我朋友亞當借傘。她的身形跟我很像。所以我從傘架上拿了他的傘。我跟教授一起去買一些麵包。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大吼大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed on that day is Adan’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對阿，那把傘是亞當的。我根本沒有想要偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember the umbrella’s color and type?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，是藍色的而且不是很新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我認知裡面，它是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone can prove that you are innocent?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有阿，當我到博物館時，我的兩個同學跟教授都跟我在一起。我教授甚至要借我他的傘，但是因為它的傘太小了，我就沒拿了。我不想要教授淋濕。我其他兩個同學也在那。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Can all of your friends arrive the court to prove what you just said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	應該是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著想要把傘環給陳小姐。可是他不接受，我想跟他道歉，它也不聽。我的兩個朋友跟教授可以證明我說的話是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Now I am going to ask Miss Chen some details of that day. Miss Chen, can you deliberate what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	when I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum, it was raining. I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack when I went into the museum. After I went out of the museum, I found out that my umbrella disappeared. I ask the staff of the museum to find my umbrella, and then I saw the foreigner gave the umbrella back to the rack. I was so angry and I ask him why he took my umbrella? Didn’t you know there is raining outside?............

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What’s the color of the umbrella which you brought at that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took that day is blue. It’s dark blue.

en-US	The umbrella on that picture is common which you can buy in any convenient store. How can you make sure that it is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	I bought the umbrella in convenient store. But the button on the umbrella is broken, and it can’t buckle up. I have told the detail to the police when I sue the case. The umbrella the foreigner gave back has the same character. It is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	null

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it is just an umbrella? …………………………………. If he didn’t give back the umbrella to me, did he want me to go home when it’s raining?

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	那天，我和一些同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看一個展覽。我們看完展後，兩個同學說他們肚子很餓。所以我們決定出去走走並且吃飯，再找找可以吃晚餐的地方。當我要離開博物館時，我發現在下雨了。我沒有帶傘所以我想要和我同學借傘。因為我比較高也比較壯，所以我決定要和我的同學艾登借傘，因為他的體型和我比較類似。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，然後和我的教授和同學去買麵包。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就對著我們大喊了。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?

zh-TW	有啊，當我回到博物館時，我的教授和同學都跟我在一起，我的教授甚至提議說要借她的雨傘給我，但是因為她的傘比較小，所以我就沒有跟她借，我不想讓她淋濕，而另外兩個同學也是一樣的情況。

en-US	Can I ask you a question? If the plaintiff is regretful and he really wants to apologize to you, can you accept his apologize, after all, this is just an umbrella?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The defendant, Paul Anderson, took Xiaoqian Chen’s umbrella in Yingge Ceramics Museum on May 27th, 2014. This behavior happened in the condition that the defendant didn’t tell to the plaintiff. When the defendant wanted to return the umbrella, Xiaoqian Chen found the defendant and found he is guilty. Therefore the plaintiff accused the defendant. The purpose of today’s procedure is to understand what happened on that day. Please answer the question the help the prosecutor to understand what happened on that day. Do you understand? Later, I will ask the plaintiff to explain what happened on that day. Do both parties understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	Me, too

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	The defendant, where were you at 4:15 pm, May 27th in 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	當時我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Miss Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有。當我把傘放回傘架的時候陳小姐就在那邊了。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我狂吼，說我偷了她的雨傘。我嘗試告訴她我不小心拿錯了，我並沒有偷她的雨傘。我嘗試向她道歉但她都不理我，她都不想聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why Miss Chen said you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟幾個同學去那邊看展覽。當我們參觀完以後我兩個同學說他們肚子餓了， 因此我們就決定出去找一些食物或者找晚餐的地點。 當我離開博物館的時候我發現正在下雨。 我沒有帶雨傘，所以我打算向同學借傘。 因為我有點高壯所以我想向我的同學Adam借雨傘，他的身形跟我差不多，所以我就從傘架拿一把傘。 我嘗試去買一些麵包給我的教授和我的朋友。 當我回來時就正是陳小姐對我吼叫的時候。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You said that the umbrella you borrowed is belonged to Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我想我借的就是亞當的。而且我沒有偷任何傘的意圖。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella which you borrowed on that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色。 它是藍色的，而且不是很新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is that the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	根據我的印象，顏色是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Who can prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	當然。 當我離開博物館的時候我的教授和我兩個同學都跟著我。 我的教授甚至想借我她的雨傘，但我教授的雨傘很小所以我就沒有拿了。 我不想讓我的教授和其他兩位同學被雨淋濕。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So your classmates and professor can come to the court to prove what you said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是的。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you need other evidence which the prosecutor can help for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我嘗試要把陳小姐的傘還她，但她不收。 我試著跟她道歉，但她完全不想接受。 也許我的教授跟我的同學可以證實我今天所說的話。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, now I want to ask Miss Chen what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you tell the details what happened on that day to us?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	It was raining and I went to The Yingge Ceramics Museum. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. After I left the museum， I found my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff of the museum to help me find my umbrella but the foreigner just came back and returned my umbrella. When I found he took my umbrella, I was so angry and asking him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? Who can do such a thing like that?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What the color and the shape of your umbrella which you took on that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	I took a blue umbrella, is deep blue on that day.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the picture of the, page five. Is that the umbrella belonged to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it was my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is a kind of common umbrella which can be bought easily in convenient store. How can you be sure that this umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought my umbrella in the convenient store. However, the button of my umbrella was broken. I can’t close my umbrella. When I tell the police, I mentioned this point to them. The umbrella which was returned by the foreigner has the same feature so I’m sure that he took my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	I want to ask you a question. If the defendant regrets and he wants to apologize to you can you forgive him and reach a settlement with him because it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? This is about the basic moral of people. If he didn’t return my umbrella, maybe I needed to walk in the rain to home. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	The court will subpoena three people who the defendant mentioned: the professor and his two classmates to explain what happened on that day. The court will be set at 3pm on June 19th 2014. The defendant and three witnesses need to come to the court. The defendant are you ok on that time?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	沒問題我可以到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The plaintiff, Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not. Basically we will ask the professor and the classmates of the defendant. If you want to come to the court, that is ok.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, it’s not necessary because I need to have a day off if I come to the court.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	Ok, I understand. So the court ends here. Please leave the court after the both parties sign the record.

en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我大聲吼，說我偷他的傘，我試著跟他說我拿錯傘了，我試著跟他道歉，但她不願意接受。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	 Why did she say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining.

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天，我和我同學來這邊看一個展覽，當看完這個展覽之後，有兩同學說他們很餓，所以我們就一起出去買點吃的，然後找個地方吃晚餐，當我要準備離開博物館的時候，發現外面在下雨，因為我沒有帶傘，所以想跟其中一個同學借一把傘。因為我人高又魁，所以想跟其中一個叫亞當的同學借傘，我跟他體型比較像。所以就從傘架中拿了一把傘。我買一些麵包給同學和教授，當我回來的時候，就看到陳小姐對我大聲怒喊著。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you that the umbrella you borrow is belong to your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Can you tell what’s color and shape you took at that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	The umbrella is whole blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	我印象中好像是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Could anyone prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	當出來的時候，我和我教授還有同學一同出來，我教授甚至願意借我傘，但他的傘實在太小，所以我沒跟他借，我不想教授因為我而淋雨，當時我有兩個同學在那。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, the three persons you just mention could prove what you said is true, is that right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence you want the police investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著把這把傘還給他，但是他不願意。此外，我想道歉，但他也不願意接受。我想我同學和教授都可以證明我說所說的都是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK, Ms. Chen, let me ask you what happened at that day?Ms.Chen , could you explain what happened at that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and it was raining at that day. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. When I leave out, I found my umbrella was gone. I ask people in museum to look for my umbrella and later I found this foreigner took my umbrella. I was angry and asked him why did he take my umbrella. It was raining at that day.

en-US	Actually, the blue umbrella you claim belongs to you is easy to buy in convenience store, how could you say that this umbrella belongs to you

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, my umbrella was bought in convenience store. The lock part of mu umbrella is little broken. I could not lock it up. I report this point when I reported to police. The umbrella which the foreigner took has the same specifics sot that I could say that the umbrella is mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	 Is it possible that you forgive the defendant? After all, he has the sense of regret.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it was just an umbrella? I think it should be public norm. If he did not return the umbrella to me, I have to come home with big rain? I do not want to forgive him.

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	事發當天我和一些同學去看展覽。當我們看完展覽的時候，我有幾個同學說他們肚子餓。因此我們決定走出博物館找些東西吃，甚至是吃晚餐。當我要離開的時候，發現正在下雨。我忘記帶傘了，所以想要和我同學借。因為我長得比較高大，所以我想要跟亞當，我的同學，借傘，他的體型和我比較相近，所以我就從傘架拿了一支傘。我就和我的老師和同學一起去買麵包了。當我們回來的時候就是事發的經過了，陳小姐就開始對我大喊。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You said that the umbrella you took at that time belonged to your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	 對，我以為我當時拿的傘是我同學的，所以我並沒有偷傘的意思。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember what the shape is the umbrella and what color is?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得它是藍色的，而且不是很新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶中，應該是藍色的吧。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anybody can prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	 是的，當我走出博物館的時候，我和老師和同學在一起，我的老師甚至提議要借我傘。但她的傘比較小，所以我並沒有跟她借，因為不想要老師淋溼，然後還有其他兩個同學在，所以就跟別人借。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Can those three people come to the court as a witness to help you?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試圖把傘還她但她不接受，我也試圖跟她道歉，但她一樣不接受。可能我的老師跟同學可以證明我今天所說的都是實話吧。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	 I’m going to ask some questions to the plaintiff, Ms. Cheng. Ms. Cheng, can you describe what happened at that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went to the Yingge Museum and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack at the front door. When I was going to leave, I found out that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff to help me find my umbrella. And at that time, I saw this foreigner came back and put back my umbrella. When I found out that the umbrella he took was mine, I angrily asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining? How could he do that?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What was the color of the umbrella which you brought that day? Is there any feature?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day was blue. Specifically, dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the picture 5 in document 1. Is the umbrella in this picture your umbrella?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is quite plain. It’s just a normal umbrella that you can buy in a convenient store. How can you confirm this umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I just bought it in 7-11. However, my umbrella has a broken park, so I can recognize it. I have explained that to the police when I filed this case at the police station. The umbrella this foreigner put back shared the same feature, so I can say that it is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant regrets for his behavior and has the will to apologize, would you accept that? After all, the thing you lost is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	How could you say that it’s just an umbrella? It’s about the moral issue. If he didn’t put back, maybe I had went(gone) home in the heavy room. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	 I understand. We will subpoena those three people the defendant mentioned to the court as witnesses. Next court will be set at 3p.m., on June 19th, 2014. And the defendant and three of the witnesses should show up. Is this time okay for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會出席。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Plaintiff, the next court you may show up or not. Depends on you. Basically, we will ask some questions to the defendant and the witnesses, so if you wouldn’t show up is okay.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No I won’t come. I need to ask for a day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. Then, today’s court is adjourned. Please sign the document and you may leave.

en-US	Indeed, my umbrella was bought from the 7-11, but the bottom of my umbrella is a little bit broken, out of order, it didn’t work very well, for this point, I’ve already told and explained to the police when I reported the case. The umbrella that the foreigner took and returned had the same problem on the umbrella, so I believe that’s my umbrella. 

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	May I ask you if the other party, the defendant, want to apologize and is very sorry about this, would you consider to forgive him? Since the thing you lost is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by only just an umbrella? It’s the issue about morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, what do you want me to do? Did I need to run in the rain and go home? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand, then we will subpoena the three people the defendant had mentioned and ask them to come to the court and ask them to verify for the case. The next court will be set on 6/19/2014, at 3 p.m., is that okay with you? And in addition, the three witness have to come as well.

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	好的我會到

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not to come for the next court. Basically, we will question the professor and the classmates of the defendant, if you want to come, it’s still ok.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I don’t want to come, if I have to come, I need to take a day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The case happened on twenty seventh, May, 2014. The defendant visited the Yingge Ceramics Museum and stole the plaintiff’s umbrella.This incident happens without informing the plaintiff.When the defendant tried to steal the umbrella, the plaintiff caught the defendant on the scene.Therefore, she filed the case against the defendant.Today we mainly want to find out what happened on that day.Please answer my question and try to explain so the prosecutor would know the whole scene. Later, I will also ask the plaintiff about what happened on that day. Do both parties understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand, too.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, where were you on twenty seventh, May, 2014 at 4:15 p.m.?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time, did you see the plaintiff, Miss Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是，當我要把傘放回傘架時，我就看到她

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大叫，說我偷了她的傘 我試著告訴她，我應該是拿錯了傘 我並沒有偷她的傘，我試著向她解釋，但是她都根本都不聽

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Then, why Miss Chen would say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	當天我和同學一起去博物館看展覽 我們看完展覽後，我的兩位同學說肚子餓了 因此我們決定出去買點東西來吃，或找個地方吃晚餐 就當我要離開博物館的時候，我看到外面在下雨 我當時沒有帶傘，所以我本來打算和我同學借一把 因為我人比較高大，所以我想要向我的朋友借一把傘，他的名字叫做亞當他的身型和我差不多 所以我就從傘架裡拿了一把傘 然後我就和我的教授和一些朋友去買麵包當我回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大喊

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	 Do you mean that the umbrella you took from the umbrella rack is the umbrella of your friend, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	 對，我當時就以為那把傘是我朋友亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you still remember the color and the shape of the umbrella you took?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色是藍色，但看起來並不新

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella all in blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶中，它是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anybody can prove what you say is true?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有，當我從博物館出來的時候，我的教授和我的兩個同學在我身邊 我的教授甚至想要借我她的傘 但是她的傘太小了，所以我並沒有跟她借傘 我並不想要害我的教授淋溼，所以我也沒有跟另外兩位同學借傘

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	 Do those three people can come to the court can prove your innocence, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想應該可以吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	 我有試著想要把雨傘還給陳小姐，但是她不肯接受，我也試著向她道歉，可是她也不願意接受 或許我的教授和我的兩個同學可以證實我今天的所言不假

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Now, I am going to ask Miss Chen about what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you briefly describe what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day. At that time, it was raining.When I entered the museum, I left my umbrella outside the museum.However, when I came out the museum, I found my umbrella missing.I asked the staff of Yingge Ceramics Museum for helping to find my umbrella. At that time, we found this foreigner taking my umbrella.When I found out that my umbrella was on his hand, I was very angry and I asked him why you stole my umbrella?Don’t you know that it is raining? It is really an impolite behavior.

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What is the color of the umbrella that you took on that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The color of the umbrella is blue, kind of deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please see the investigatory file number one on the fifth page. Is this umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on the investigatory file is quite a common type of umbrellas which everybody can buy it on 7-11. How you can say that it is the umbrella that is of yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	That’s true. That’s the umbrella I bought from 7-11.However, there is a problem on the button of my umbrella so it is hard to fold it.When I filed the case against him in the police office, I did mention this point.The umbrella that this foreigner put back into the umbrella rack is also with this special point so I regarded it was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the other party does have the wiliness to settle this case and apologize, are you willing to accept his apology and settle the case? After all, it is an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it is just an umbrella? It is about does a person have morality or not.On that day, if he didn’t come back and put back the umbrella, I would go home in all wet.I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand.Then the court will subpoena those three people mentioned by the defendant to the court and to make some explanations.The next court date is set by nineteenth, June, 2014, at three p.m. On that day, the defendant and those three witnesses show up.

en-US	Miss Chen, you don’t have to be here on the next court date.Basically, on that day, we will ask some questions to his professor and fellow classmates. If you want to come, it is Okay.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I won’t be here because I have to ask a day-off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我喊叫，說我偷他雨傘。我試著跟他說我一定是拿錯傘了，我沒有偷他的傘。我想要道歉，可是她都不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	當天我跟一些同學去看展覽。看完展覽之後，我有兩個同學說肚子餓了。我們想要出來吃點東西，就是晚餐吧。我要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了。我沒有帶傘所以我想跟同學借一把。因為我人有點高大，所以我原本想跟亞當借傘。他的身形跟我比較像。所以我就從傘架拿一把傘，我跟教授跟朋友去買一些麵包。我回來，陳小姐就對我喊叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you used were adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我當時以為是亞當的，我並沒有想偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	我現在回想起來，是藍色沒錯

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone who can prove your statement?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有，當我走出博物館的時候，我的教授和兩位朋友和我在一起。我教授甚至說要借我他的傘。因為他的傘有點小，所以我就沒有接受。我不想他的衣服濕掉，所以…

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So probably we can have three of them as a witness in the court. Right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想可以吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

en-US	I went to the Ying-ge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. As I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. However, when I was about to leave the museum, I found the umbrella disappeared. I asked the staff find the umbrella for me. Then I saw this foreigner who is carrying my umbrella. When I found that the umbrella that he was taking was mine, I was furious. Didn’t he know that it was raining. He didn’t have any empathy.

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Was there anything special on your umbrella? I mean, is there any marks?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella was blue, specificly dark blue.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	This kind of umbrella can be bought in convenience stores, such as 7-11. How can you make sure that this umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought the umbrella at 7-11. And there’s some damage on the opening part. When I was at the police station, I told th police this point. And the umbrella also had the same trait. So I could say that that umbrella was actually mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So will you forgive him if he’s really regretful. I mean the incident is all an umbrella, which is not a big deal.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean not a big deal? It’s about empathy. If he hadnt returned the umbrella, I must have been wet and walked all the way home. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The time was 5/27 2013. In that time, the defendant took plaintiff’s umbrella in Yingge Ceramics Museum. The plaintiff was unknown with this case. When the defendant took the umbrella back, the plaintiff found what he did. So the plaintiff filed this case. Today’s procedure mainly understand what happened in that day. You have to answer my questions to make the prosecutor understand what happened in that day, do you understand? And I will ask the plaintiff what happened in that day. Do both parties understand this procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解了。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, at 4:15 PM on 5/27 2014, where were you in that day?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時正在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Hsio Chien Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，當我把傘還回傘架的時候，我有看到她。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened in that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她叫說我偷了她的傘。我試圖告訴她我只是拿錯了傘。我並沒有偷她的傘，我試圖向她道歉，但她還是大叫。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why would Hsio Chien Chen say that you steal her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和同學們去博物館參觀展覽，當我們結束參觀展覽之後我有兩個同學說他們餓了。於是我們決定出去找東西吃，那大概是在晚餐的時間。當我們正要離開的時候，我們發現外面正在下雨。我並沒有帶傘，所以我打算和我的同學借傘。因為我人比較高大，所以我決定跟我的同學借一把比較大的傘。因為他的體型跟我比較像。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，我和一些教授還有我的同學同行。當我回去時，陳小姐就對著我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean that the umbrella that you took is your friend, Adam’s? 

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	沒錯，我那時候就想說，那把傘是亞當的。我並沒有打算要偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color and shape that umbrella you took?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得那把傘是藍色的，但不是一把新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	So is only one color blue for the umbrella?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	就我所知，那把傘是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Do anyone can verify what you state?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	當然阿，我身邊有一些教授和兩位朋友。我的教授甚至跟我說，要借我一把傘。但是她的傘太小了，不適合我。我不想要她淋濕，我的另外兩外同學也在旁邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three people can make it to verify this situation for you, is that right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do any other … you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著還陳小姐傘，但她不想理我。我試著向她道歉，但她也不想理我。也許我的教授和我的朋友可以證實我今天所說的話。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Now, I am going to ask Ms. Chen what happened in that day. Ms. Chen, could you say what happened in that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	The day I went to Ying ge Ceramics Museum, it was a raining day. When I entered in the Museum, I put my umbrella in my umbrella rack. When I went out, I cannot find my umbrella. I asked the Museum’s officer to help me to look for the umbrella, and I found that the defendant out back my umbrella. When I found that he took my umbrella back, I was angry. And I asked him why he took my umbrella away. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How could he do that? So what’s the color of the umbrella you took in that day?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	And is any characteristic of that umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella that I took in that day is blue. Perhaps it’s deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now, we are going to show you investigatory file of page5. The umbrella in the photo is yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it’s mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the photo is a very common type. Anyone can buy it in the convenient store of 7-11. How could you know it was your umbrella? 

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought it in 7-11. However, my umbrella’s button was broken, so the button cannot be used. For this point, I explained it when I told to the police. The umbrella that he put back meets this characteristic, so I think it’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So would you forgive the defendant if he wants to regret and apologize for you?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	How can you say that? It’s about the basic moral. If he didn’t put the umbrella back, …. I wouldn’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. We will subpoena three of witness in that day, and we will try to ask them what happened in that day. Defendant, the next court date will set at3:00 P.M. in June 19 2014, and three of witness and you should make it, is that ok with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Plaintiff, Ms. Chen, you can make it if you want. We will manly ask the defendant’s classmates and professors, you can make it or not.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I wouldn’t make it.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. The court will dismiss here. Please sign the statement and leave the court.

zh-TW	今為偷竊案件偵字1425號偵查程序

zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Miss Chen, at that time?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有，當我正要把雨傘放回傘架的時候，陳小倩她有在現場。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大吼大叫說:「我她了她的雨傘。」我試著告訴他我是拿錯雨傘，我沒有偷她的雨傘，我有試著跟她解釋，但是她一點都不想聽我的解釋。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Can you explain why Ms. Chen stated that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining.

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和我的同學去博物館看一場展覽。當我們看完展覽的時候，我的兩個同學說他們很餓，所以我們決定離開，去看看有沒有甚麼東西可以吃，所以我們就離開去找餐廳。當我離開博物館時，我發現下雨，我沒有帶傘，所以我打算跟我的同學借一把。因為我的體格比較高，所以我決定跟我的朋友Adam借傘。他和我的體格相近。然後我就雨傘架拿了一把雨傘。然後我打算去買一些麵包給我的教授和朋。當我們回來時，陳小姐看到我就對我大吼大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You are saying that the umbrella you borrowed was your classmate’s,Adam’s, umbrella?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我以為我拿的傘就是亞當的雨傘。我並沒有意圖打算要偷任何人的雨傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you rememer the shape and the colore of the umbrella you took?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶裡，它的顏色是藍色。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can someone prove what you say is truth?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	當我回到博物館時，我的教授和我的兩個朋友當時和我在一起。我的教授甚至本來打算要借我她的雨傘，但是她的雨傘有點小，所以我並沒有接受。我不想要讓教授淋溼，而且我的兩個同學也都在那裏。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, the three person, who were with you, might can come to the cour to prove what you say is truth, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you want the court to imvestigate any evidence for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著要把傘還給陳小姐，但她不接受。我也試著跟她道歉，但是她一句話也不想聽我說。或許我的教授跟我的兩個同學可以證明我說的是實話。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Okay,now I am going to ask Ms. Chen some questions about the detail on that day. Ms. Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went to Ying ge Ceramic museum, and it was rainy. When I entered into the museum, I put my umbrella at the umbrella track. But when I came out, I couldn’t find my umbrella. I asked the staff in the museum to help me find my umbrella, and later I saw this foreigner came back and with my umbrella. When I found out that the umbrella he took was my missing umbrella, I was angry and I asked him: why do you took my umbrella? Don’t you know it was rainy outside? How can you do that without any ethics?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Can you tell me what’s the color of your umbrella and does it have any feature?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The Umbrella I brought that day was blue, I think the color exactly it was deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the photo on page 5 of investigation file one. Does the umbrella in the photo belong to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the photo was very common; everyone can get one at the 7-11. How can you sure that the umbrella is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	That’s true; I bought my umbrella at the 7-11. But my umbrella has some flaws and it cannot be hold tidily. When I filed the case, I specifically described this feature to the police. The umbrella which was taken by the foreigner has the same feature. So, in other words, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant would like to apologize and show his regret, would you consider to settle the case with him?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it is just an umbrella? It is about ethics. If he did not put my umbrella back, did you mean that I need to go home in such rain? I do not want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

en-US	 Ms. Chen, the next court date you can decide to come or not. The main purpose on that day will be to ask defendant’s professor classmates some questions about that day.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	Well won’t show up. I don’t want to take one day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的我當時認為那把傘就是亞當的,我當時並有想要偷任何人的

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the shape and the color of the umbrella you took that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得他是一把藍色的傘,而且不是一把新的傘

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	So the whole is blue…..so the whole umbrella is blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我記憶中那把傘就是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone prove your statement?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的當我離開博物館的時候我的教授跟我兩個同學都跟我一起,我的教授甚至說他要借我他的傘,但是因為他的傘實在太小了,所以我就沒有跟他拿,我不想要他被雨淋濕,而我也不想要另外兩個同學淋濕

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three can prove your statement for you or you can ask them to come to the court to prove, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想應該是可以

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	So do any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著把傘還他,但他不理我,我也試著向他道歉,但他也是完全不理睬我,或許我的教授跟同學可以為我佐證我說的話,也可以證明我那天的行為

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, let’s move on to Miss Chen. Miss Chen, Can you explain what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	In that day, I…. went to Yigge Ceramic Musem and it was a rainy day. I put my umbrella in. the umbrella rack before I went into the museum. But when I went out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the museum staff to help me to search my umbrella; finally, I found that the defendant took my umbrella. When I found that the umbrella he hold is my umbrella, I was very angry. I question………I said that didn’t you know that it was a rainy day, how can you………..

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	So what’s the shape your umbrella? Does it have any features?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	My umbrella must be blue. It is dark blue…it is a dark blue one.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now I’m going to show you a picture. In the file 1 ……….. Is that umbrella in the picture is yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it’s mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in that picture is very a common one which can buy in 7-11…in the convenience store. How can you sure that the umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought my umbrella in the convenience store. However, there is some defect on my umbrella, it cannot be attached…. closely. I was….I told to the police that feature when I go to the police station. The umbrella backed to the umbrella rack has same feature, so I sure that it is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So if the defendant is regrettable for this case. Do you want to settle this course? However, it is just a umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	Why do you mean “it is a umbrella?” It is concerned about morality. If he didn’t return my umbrella, should I went to home without umbrella? So I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. So we will subpoena the three people the defendant just mentioned to ask to explain what happened in that day. The next court set on the June 19, 2014. 3pm. Do both party can come to the court?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的我會來

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, it is your choice to come or not to come. Basically, we will ask the defendant’s professor and friends to understand the details in that day.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I don’t want to come because ……..

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. So the court dismissed here. Please sign the waiver here, after you sign that, you can leave.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The plaintiff… the case happened in… happened at 2014, May 27th, and the plaintiff went to Yinge Ceramics Museum and took…sorry, sorry, again.

en-US	So, Mr. Ho, can you tell me where were… where were you at 20… 2014, May 27th, 4…um…4:15 in the afternoon?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time, did you… did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	當我要把傘放回傘架時，她就在那裏。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大喊大叫，說我偷了她的傘。我告訴她我應該是拿錯傘了。我並沒有偷她的傘，我試著向她解釋，但她根本不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Then why Ms. Chen said you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	當天我和一些同學到陶瓷館去看一個展覽。我們看完展覽之後，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定出去買點吃的，或是決定找個地方吃晚餐。我離開博物館的時候，發現正在下雨，因為我沒有帶傘，所以本來打算跟同學借一把。因為我人比較大隻，所以我打算跟我同學Adam借傘，他的身形跟我比較像。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘。然 後我就和我的教授和朋友去買了點麵包。我們回來的時候，那個時候就是陳小姐開始對我大喊大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you took that day… you borrowed that day, was from your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我以為那把傘是亞當的。我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Can you recall that the umbrella you took that day, the color and the shape…?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，是一把藍色的傘，而且沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Did the whole umbrella was blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	印象中，它就是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anybody can prove what you just said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	可以，當我從陶瓷館出來的時候，我的教授和兩個同學跟我在一起。我教授本來還說要借我她的傘，但她的傘…因為太小了，所以我沒有拿。我不想要教授淋溼，而且我的兩個同學也都在那邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So… the three person, your professor and your two classmates, they can vertify (verify) your words in the court, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence that you want the court investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我曾經…我試著把傘還給陳小姐，但她不拿；我也曾向…我也曾經試著跟他道歉，但她不聽。也許我教授和同學可以證明我所說的是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK. Now I’m going to ask Ms. Chen what happened that day. Ms. Chen can you give us a description what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day, and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack outside the museum. When I got out, my umbrella was gone. I ask the staff to look for my umbrella, and that’s the time I saw this foreigner took the umbrella and put it back here. When I found out that umbrella was my missing umbrella, I was furious, and I asked why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside? How can he do such thing?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Can you tell me the… the color and the shape… is there any feature of your umbrella you brought that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	It was blue, and I suppose it was a deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please see the investigatory book and the evident one. Can you tell us is the umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	Actually, this umbrella looks very common, is a very common…it’s a very common type umbrella. You can bought it…you can buy it in 7-11, how can you tell this is exactly your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yeah, it’s true. I bought my umbrella in 7-11. But my umbrella… there is a little bit… there is a little bit broken… a broken part in the bottom, so it cannot function very well. And this point, when I filed the case, I explained it to the police. The umbrella that foreigner put back to the rack has the same feature, so that’s… so I know that was my umbrella. So I knew that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	But if the other side, if this foreigner, have the regretful thought and he wants to apologize, can you… do you consider to forgive him or reach a settlement? Because it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? It’s the problem of someone’s moral questions. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, what do you want? I walked… I walked home in those heavy rain? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. OK. We will… the court will send subpoena to the… those three party, the professor and the two classmates, and ask them to vertify (verify) what the defendant said in the court. The next court will be held at three o’clock afternoon, in 2014, June 19th. And the three witness and the defendant will here. Defendant, is this time OK for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	我可以，我會到場。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	 Ms. Chen, you don’t have to be here in the next court. The main purpose that day will be asking what really happened from… ask professor and his classmates what really happened that day. But if you want to come… but if you want to come, it’s also welcomed.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I don’t think I won’t be...No, I don’t think I will be here. Because I have to took a day off… I have take a day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What’s the color of your umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took on that day is a blue one, deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the investigatory file, page 1. Look at the picture. Is the umbrella in this picture yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is a very common one which can buy in any convenience store. How can you be so sure that umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes I bought it in a convenience store. It’s true but my umbrella’s button is broken. So I can easily recognize it. I told the police when I was at the police station. The umbrella, which the foreigners put back, also shares the trait. So I think that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Will you consider to forgive him if he sincerely apologize to you. It’s just an umbrella, right?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean about it’s just an umbrella? This is something about moral, attitudes. If he didn’t put the umbrella back, maybe I have to go home with the pouring rain. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. OK then we will send three sopeanas to those people he just mentioned and ask them come to the court to explain what happened on that that. The next court is at 3 PM on June19th, in 2014. Is the defendant and your three friends be here? Is that ok with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的我會準時到

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, the next court you can choose to come or not. It depends on you. Basically, we are going to ask the defendant and his friends and his professor. So if you are not here, it’s okay.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I won’t be here. I don’t want…

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	Ok I understand and we will end the court here. Please confirm and sign the documents and then you can go.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The incident happened on May 27th, 2014. The defendant Paul Anderson took away the plaintiff, Hsiao-Chien Chen’s umbrella at the Ceramics Museum in Ying Ge. The defendant took away the plaintiff’s umbrella without telling…without informing her. When you were returning the umbrella, you were found by Hsiao-Chien Chen, and she knew that you took her umbrella away. As a result, she filed for the case. Today…the procedure today…in the procedure today, we would mainly want to know what happened on that day. Please answer the questions in order to let the prosecutor understand what happened on that day, is that OK with you? After that, I would ask the plaintiff what happened on that day. Do you understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	 I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	So defendant, where were you at 4:15 PM on May 27th, 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我那時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Hsiao-Chien Chen at that time?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有，我那時候把傘放回到傘架的時候，就看到她了。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大叫然後說我偷了她的傘。我試著告訴她我應該是拿錯了，我並沒有想要偷她的傘，我想要跟她道歉，但是她就是不聽我說話。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	So why did Miss Chen say you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟我的一些同學去那邊看一個展覽。我們看完之後，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們就出去想找點吃的，或許就是吃個晚餐這樣吧。正當我要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了。我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟我一個同學借。因為我就是蠻高…蠻大…蠻胖的，所以我想跟我的朋友亞當借一隻傘，他跟我的體型比較像。所以我有從傘架拿了一隻傘，然後我就跟教授去買一些麵包，當我回來的時候陳小姐就開始對我叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You said that the umbrella you borrowed at that time was Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對啊，我以為我拿的傘是亞當的，我沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the umbrella you took…what color it looked like…the umbrella you took that day.

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，然後不是很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the umbrella blue? All over the umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	嗯，回想起來是沒錯。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone prove what you just said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有啊，我那時候走出博物館的時候，我的教授和我的兩個同學都和我在一起。我的教授還說她可以把傘借給我。但因為她的傘很小，我就沒有跟她借。我不想要她淋濕，而且我還有兩個同學在旁邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	 So the above three people can come to the court and prove that…prove what you just said here, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Then what…are there any evidence you want the prosecutor to investigate?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著想把傘還給陳小姐、跟她道歉，但她就是不聽我講話。或許我的教授跟兩個同學可以證明我講的話是正確…真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK, now I would like to ask Miss Chen what happened on that day. Miss Chen, could you please explain what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	On that day I went to Ying Ge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. When I went into the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack, and when I came out, my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff of the museum to look for it for me, and then I see this foreign coming back, wanting to put the umbrella back. When I found that the umbrella he was taking is mine, I was very angry and questioned him why he took my umbrella away. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How can a person have no such responsibility?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	So…what color was your umbrella on that day? What other traits did it have?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought on that day was blue. It was dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please look at the picture on page five on the investigation file. Please take a look at the picture. Is this umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it was that umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on the photo was very ordinary. It’s like one you can buy in 7-11. How can you make sure it was yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I did buy my umbrella at 7-11. However there was a damage on the button part, so I know it was mine. I did explain about this when I filed for the case to the prosecutor. The umbrella which the foreigner put back also possesses that trait…so I know that the umbrella is mine…was mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Then I would like to ask you, if the other…the defendant…is willing to regret and apologize, would you forgive him? Because it was just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by it was just an umbrella? It is a matter of whether he cares for others or not. If he didn’t take the umbrella back, do you want me to go out when it was raining? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. So I will subpoena the three people he mentioned to the court and ask them to prove what he said was right. The next court will be set at 3 PM, June 19th, 2014. Plantiff, defendant, and the three witnesses should be here. Defendant, is the date OK with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	好的，我會到。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, you may come or not in the…on the next court. Basically who we are asking are the defendant’s professor and classmates, but if you would like to come, it will be OK as well.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I don’t think I’m coming. I need to take that day off if I would like to come.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. Then the procedure ends here today. Please leave the court after you sign for the record.

I ask the staff to help me find it. Later I saw the foreigner put the umbrella back. I was angry. Ask him why did you take my umbrella? Didn’t he know it was raining outside? How a person can be so impolite?

en-US	Indeed, I bought it in 7-11. But the locker part of the umbrella is broken. It cannot luck. When I report the case, I explained it to the police carefully. The umbrella the foreigner put back has the same feature, so it is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the other party is willing to apologize, could you forgive him? It is just an umbrella..

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it is just an umbrella? It is about whether a person is ….. if he did not return it, are you going to tell me I should go home in the big rain? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The defendant, Paul Anderson, on May 27, 2014 went to Inge Museum and had taken the umbrella of the plaintiff, Xiao-Chen Cheng. This act was committed without notifying the plaintiff beforehand. When you were going to return the umbrella, you were caught red-handed with the umbrella by the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff pressed the charge. The goal of our procedure today, is to understand what happened that day. Please answer accordingly to my questions, do you understand? Later on, I will also inquire the plaintiff to understand what happened that day. Do both parties understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	 I understand, too. 

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	This question is for the defendant. On 4:15PM of May 27th 2014, where were you?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我在鶯歌博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen, at that time?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有，我當時要把傘放回傘架時有看到他

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她向我大叫，說我偷了她的傘。我嘗試告訴他我可能搞錯了，拿錯傘。我並不是在偷他的傘，我…嘗試要向他解釋，但他不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Then why would Ms. Chen say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和幾個同學一起去看展。看完展後，我有幾個同學說他們餓了。所以我們決定出去找個東西吃，可能找個地方吃晚餐。當我們要離開博物館時，我們發現開始下雨了。因為我本來沒有帶傘，我本來要和我同學借。因為我身形比較高大，我本來要和我朋友亞當借傘。他的體型和我比較相近。之後我就從傘架裡面抽了一支傘，然後和我的教授和同學們出去了。當我們回來的時候，就是被陳小姐大罵的時候。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	So you mean the umbrella you borrowed belonged to Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我以為我手中那隻傘是亞當的，而我沒有意圖偷那支傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得傘的顏色，他是藍色的，也不是新的那種。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	The whole umbrella is blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	回想起來，傘的確是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone prove that for you?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有，當我離開博物館的時候，教授和兩個同學都在我身邊。我的教授甚至主動借我他的傘。但是因為他的傘比較小，我就沒有答應他。我不想要老師林濕。當然我另外兩個同學…當時也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three people you mentioned will be able to come to court to prove your statement, is that right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Are there any evidence you wish the prosecutor to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我想要歸還傘給陳小姐，但他不願意拿。我嘗試向她道歉，但她不願意聽我說。或許我的教授和朋友們可以幫我證明我今天講的話屬實。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	All right, now I will inquire Ms. Chen for what happened that day. Ms. Chen, can you explain what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	When I went to Inge Museum, it was raining then. When I entered the museum, I placed my umbrella in to the umbrella rack. But when I came out, my umbrella was missing. I asked the museum staff to help me look for the umbrella. And when I came back, I found this person returning the umbrella. When I realized the umbrella in his hands belonged to me, I was very angry and I asked him why did he take my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside, how could he be so impolite?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What color was your umbrella? Are there any characteristics to it?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought to the museum that day was blue. It should be dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella in this picture…Does this umbrella belong to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, this is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is a very…. common umbrella. The kind of umbrella you can find in 7-11, how do you know the umbrella belongs to you?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	That’s true, I bought my umbrella at 7-11, but the button on my umbrella is a bit broken. On this point, when I filed the case to the police, I emphasized this point.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	The umbrella the foreigner placed in the umbrella rack had the same characteristic, so I knew the umbrella was mine. May I ask you if he regrets what he did and is willing to apologize, are you willing to forgive him? I mean it is only an umbrella after all.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by “it’s only an umbrella.” If he didn’t return it to me that day, I would have to go home in the rain. I am not willing to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. Then we will send warrants to the three people… the three witnesses that day, and ask them to come to court. The next court will be held on June 19th 2014, at 3PM, the three witnesses and the defendant should be here in court. Do you understand?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是，我會到場。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The plaintiff, Ms. Chen, the next court you can choose to come at your will. Basically, this is an inquiry for the defendant and his two classmates and professor, so it will be all right if you don’t come.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I think not… because I’d have to… take a day off from work.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. All right, our court ends here. May the two parties please sign here, and you may leave.

en-US	The incident happens on May 27, 2014. The defendant Paul Anderson took an umbrella when he was in Ying Ge Ceramics Museum, and the defendant Paul Anderson took the plaintiff’s umbrella without informing her. When the defendant wanted to return the umbrella back to its owner, Hsiao-Chien Wang…caught him. Therefore, Hsiao-Chien Wang filed this case. In today’s procedure, we need to mainly understand what happened that day. Please answer all of my questions so that the prosecutor can understand what exactly happened that day, do you understand?

en-US	Defendant, where were you at four fifteen, on May 27, in year 2014? Four fifteen in the afternoon….

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我那時在三峽鶯歌陶瓷的博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	 Did you see the plaintiff Hsiao-Chien Chen at that time?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有，在我把傘放回傘架時，小倩小姐就在那理。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她大喊:「是你偷了我的傘!」我告訴她我應該是拿錯傘了啦。我真的沒有偷她的傘，我一直試著跟她道歉，但是她就是不接受。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Then why did Hsiao-Chien Chen claimed you of stealing her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天，我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館參展看展啊。看完展覽後，其中有兩個同學就說他們餓了。所以我們就決定出去找找食物，找個能吃晚餐的地方。一離開博物館的時候，就下雨了。因為我沒有帶雨傘，所以我就決定借我同學的傘。因為我比較高壯一點，所以我就決定借我同學亞當的傘，因為他的體型跟我很像。所以我就從傘架拿出一個傘，然後和我的教授和兩個朋友一起去買麵包。當我們這群人回到博物館後，陳小姐就對我大喊。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	 So do you mean that at that time, the umbrella that you borrowed was…you borrowed it from Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的。我當時是真的認為是亞當的傘。我根本就沒有想到要偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Then do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you took that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，然後沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	據我所知，對，全部都是藍的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can someone proof what you said was right?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	可以啊，跟我出去的教授還有兩位同學一起來開博物館，他們可以證明。我教授甚至還願意借我他的雨傘。但是由於他的傘太小，所以我就謝絕他。而且我也不希望我的教授淋雨啊，那時候我兩個同學都在。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	If so, then these three people will be able to come to the court and play as the role of the witnesses, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	應該可以吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Then is there anything else you wish the prosecutor to investigate?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著要還給陳小姐她的傘了，但是她不接受，然後我試著跟她道歉，她也不接受。我認為我的教授和兩位同學都來到這裡證明我所說得一切都是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Okay, now let me ask Ms. Chen what really happened that day. Can you describe what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	That day, it was raining, and I went to the Ceramics Museum in Ying Ge. Before entering the museum, I placed my umbrella on the umbrella rack. But when I came out of the museum, my umbrella was gone. I asked one of the workers in the museum to help me find the umbrella, and I saw this young man taking my umbrella at that time. When I saw my umbrella on his hand, I was very, very furious, and I questioned him loudly why he would want to take my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining hard at that time? Did he have any conscience?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Then may I ask you that what color was your umbrella that you brought that day? Did it have any special symbols?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	Well, the umbrella that I brought that day was blue. It was dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now let us look at evidence number one, page five. Please take a look at this photo. Was this umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s it. That’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture was just a very, very normal umbrella, which can be purchased in any convenience store, such as 7-11. How can you prove that this was the umbrella that you brought that day?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	You’re right, I brought the umbrella at 7-11. However, there is something wrong with my umbrella. The button of my umbrella couldn’t work. Therefore, when I filed this case, I had explained clearly to the police about this trait. Moreover, the umbrella that this foreigner took and put back had this trait, too; therefore, I can prove that that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Then, now the defendant apologized to you…is willing to apologize to you and showed some regrets, are you willing to forgive the defendant? Because it’s just….he accidentally took your umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	 Hey, what do you mean by saying that it was just an umbrella? It shows that this person has no conscience. I assume that if that person didn’t return my umbrella back to me on that day, then I would just end up being all wet. I will not forgive the defendant.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Okay, I understand now. We will subpoena the three people as witnesses to the court, the three people that the defendant just mentioned. We’ll set up a time to open a court next time at three o’ clock pm, on June 19, 2014, and the defendant plus the three witnesses should all be here. Defendant, do you understand?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我了解了。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	As for Ms. Chen, the plaintiff, you can come to the court next time, or you can choose not to. Basically, during the next court…the procedure of the next court, we will mainly ask the witnesses, including the professor what happened that day.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	Well, I won’t come on that day because I even need to take a leave.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我喊說，我偷了她的雨傘。我試著跟她說，我是拿錯傘了。我並沒有都她的雨傘，我試著跟她道歉，但她都不理我。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Then, how come the plaintiff said that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	在那天，我跟我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館。當我們逛完博物館後，有兩個同學說他們肚子餓了。所以我們想出去買晚餐，或是找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開的時候，我發現外面在下雨。我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想要借我朋友的傘。因為我有點高大，所以想跟我的同學亞當借雨傘。他的體型跟我較接近。然後我就從傘架拿了一把傘。然後我就和我的教授跟朋友一起買了麵包。但我回來的時候，陳小姐就對我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Did you say that the umbrella you borrowed belonged to your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	沒錯，我之前看，是亞當拿著那把雨傘，我並沒有想要偷雨傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember the color as well as the shape of the umbrella you borrowed?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，那把傘是藍色的，不是很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	So, was the umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	我記得那把傘是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Was there any person or witness can prove what you just said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	當然有，當時我看我的教授和兩個朋友一起出來。我教授也想借我傘呢。但我教授的傘太小了，我辦法拿。我不想要讓我的教授和朋友被雨淋濕。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, those three people can go to the court as witnesses to prove what you just said. Is that right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我是這麼覺得。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence which you hope that the prosecutor can investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著想把傘還給陳小姐，但她不接受，我也想試著道歉，但她又不願意接受。也與我的教授還有同學可以證明我剛才所說的話。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Okay, now the court will ask the plaintiff questions about what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it was rainy on that day. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack outside. When I came out, I found that my umbrella disappeared. I asked the personnel in the museum to help me find my umbrella. However, I later saw the defendant come to the museum with my umbrella. When I saw he held my umbrella, I was very angry and yelled why you took my umbrella. Didn’t you know that it was rainy outside? How could you do this?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Can the court the features of your umbrella you brought on that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	It was blue, very deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the picture on the page 5 of the investigatory file 1. Is the umbrella in the picture belonging to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it was my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on the picture could be commonly bought in convenient stores. How could you assure that the umbrella was yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought my umbrella in 7-11. However, the bottom on my umbrella was broken. I could recognize my umbrella with the broken feature. As to this feature, I had made my explanations to the police. The umbrella returned by the foreigner also had the same characteristic. Therefore, I was sure that that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	The plaintiff, will you consider to settle the case if the defendant shows his regret and wants to apologize to you because it was just an umbrella?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it was just an umbrella? It was a common moral issue among people. If the defendant didn’t return my umbrella, I would get very wet when I went home! I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Okay, I understand. The court will subpoena the three people that the defendant just mentioned as witnesses for the case. The next court day will be set at 3:00 p.m. on June 19th, 2014. Both the people and the defendant have to attend the court on that day. The defendant, can you make it on that day?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	好的，我沒問題。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The plaintiff, you can come to the court if you want. Basically, the court will ask questions with the professor and the two classmates. You also can show up if you wanted.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	Well, I think I will not show up on that day because I have to ask for a leave.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	Okay, I understand. Today’s procedure will end here. Both parties, please sign the document before you leave.

zh-TW	今為偷竊案件偵字1425號偵查程序
en-US	Today we are here for investigatory procedure, case number 1425, theft.

zh-TW	那天我和一些同學一起去看一些展覽，當我們看完展覽時，我2位同學說他們餓了，所以我們決定出去買一些食物並找地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，我發現下雨了，我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟我同學借傘。因為我非常高，也有點壯，所以我決定向我的朋友Adam借傘。因為他的身形跟我比較相似。所以我就從傘架拿一把傘，然後我和我的教授去買一些麵包給我的朋友。當我回來時，陳小姐就開始對我大吼大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean the umbrella you borrowed was your friend Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.

I asked the working staff in the museum to help me to find my umbrella and then I just saw the foreigner just put the umbrella back to the rack. When I found that the umbrella he took was the umbrella I have lost, I was very angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside? Why did he so mean?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	So what was the color of the umbrella you brought that day? Did that have any characteristic?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The color of the umbrella I brought that day was blue, and it’s dark blue

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the investigatory record on page 5, is the umbrella belongs to you on that picture?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture was very common that can be bought in 7-11, how can you make sure that umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought my umbrella in 7-11; however, the bottom of my umbrella was a little broken, so I cannot just… When I reported the case, I have explained to the police. The umbrella the foreigner put back has also this characteristic, so I am sure that umbrella is mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So if the foreigner have regretted and is also willing to apologize, do you plan to forgive him? Because you have lost is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What does it mean it just an umbrella? The problem now is that this is an issue about the moral. If he didn’t return the umbrella, you wanted me to got wet on that day? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

Would that time be ok for you, the defendant?

zh-TW	嗯，我可以到

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The plaintiff Ms. Chen, you can be there or not, it’s up to you. The main purpose on that day is to ask the defendant’s professor and his classmates. If you want to come, it will be ok.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, if I come, I will have to take days off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand, so the court will dismiss here today. So both parties you can leave after signing the paper.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	On the 7th of May 2014, Mr. Paul Anderson is accused of taking Xiao Qian Chen’s umbrella in Yingge Ceramics Museum. The incident happened without informing the plaintiff. When you were about to return the umbrella, you were caught by the plaintiff  Xiao Qian Chen. Therefore, she has filed this case. In today’s incident we want to find out what happened on that day. Please elaborate on my question, it will help the court to understand what happened. Later, I will also ask the plaintiff for details to further understand about the incident.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, what were you doing on the 27th of May, 2014 at 4:15PM?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	So did you see the Plaintiff Xiao Qian Chen? 

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	對, 幫我把雨傘放回傘架, 陳小姐就在那裡

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that moment?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我咆嘯, 說我偷她的雨傘. 我試著告訴她我一定是拿錯雨傘了, 我並沒有偷她的傘, 我有試著道歉但她聽不進去

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	So why did the plaintiff said that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和我的一些同學, 參觀了陶瓷博物館的一個展覽, 我們那時候已經看完展覽了, 我的兩個同學說他們餓了. 那時候我們想說去找點食物吃, 順便吃晚餐. 當我要離開陶瓷博物館的時候, 我發現外面正在下大雨. 我沒有帶雨傘, 所以打算向同學借雨傘. 因為我長得比較高大, 所以我打算跟我同學Adam借傘, 他的體型跟我差不多. 所以我就從傘架拿了一把傘, 我和我的教授去買一些麵包. 當我們回來的時候, 那時候陳小姐就開始對我們大吼大叫.

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean at that time, the umbrella you took was Adam’s umbrella?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對我那時候以為我拿到的是Adam的傘, 我並沒有想要偷別人的傘

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember what kind of umbrella you took? Color or shape?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得是藍色的傘而且不是新的傘

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	So was the umbrella all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶中, 傘是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone verify or prove your statement?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的, 當我走出博物館時我的教授和兩位同學在我旁邊, 我教授甚至要借我她的雨傘, 但她的雨傘太小所以我就沒有跟她借了, 我不希望她淋濕而且那時候其他兩位同學也在

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	They should be able to come to the court and witness what you said right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想應該是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any other evidence that you wish the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我有試著把傘還給陳小姐但她不接受, 我也試著跟她道歉但她也不接受或許我的教授和同學能證明我剛剛講的都是事實

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, now I’m going to ask Miss. Chen what happened on that day. Miss. Chen, can you elaborate on the incident, what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	That day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and it was raining. I put the umbrella in the umbrella rack when I entered the museum. And after I finished the exhibition, my umbrella wasn’t there anymore. I asked the museum staff to help me find my umbrella, it was then I discovered that this foreigner took my umbrella. I was very angry to discover that he took my umbrella so I yelled at him and ask him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside? How could he done such thing.

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What umbrella did you bring that day? The color or shape?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought was blue, dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please see the investigatory file1, is the umbrella in the photo your umbrella?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is very common, you can buy this umbrella in any convenience store like Seven-Eleven. How can you prove that this is the one that’s stolen?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Ya, it’s true, I bought my umbrella in Seven-Eleven. But my umbrella has a broken piece at its buckle so it cannot function very well. On this point, I told the police. Then the umbrella that foreinger put back has the same feature as I said. So I’m sure he took my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant regret about the incident and want to apologize and reconcile, are you willing to settle this case?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by just an umbrella? If he didn’t return the umbrella, I would have to return home all wet. I don’t want to forgive hime.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	It’s okay, I don’t want to take one day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他當時就對我大吼，說我偷了他的傘，但是我…我只是，我好像只是拿錯了傘而已，我並沒有要偷他傘的意思。我試著想要跟他道歉，但他不願意聽我說話。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did the plaintiff say you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	在那天，去鶯歌博物館…看展覽的時候，我是與我的同學一起去的。然後在…在後來有兩個同學講說他們其實...就是他們感覺有點餓了，然後我們就想說要出博物館去找食物吃，就解決我們的晚餐，這樣子。在我準備要離開博物館的時候，我發現說正在下雨，那我就打算跟我的同學借一把雨傘，因為我沒有帶傘這樣子。因為我長得又高又…大，所以我就想要借我同學，亞當的傘，因為他跟我的身型很類似。於是我就從雨架上拿了一把雨傘，然後跟我的教授一起出去買麵包，跟一些其他東西吃，那在我們回來的時候，我就發現陳小姐就在傘架附近，然後開始對我大吼。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Well… So what you mean is that the umbrella belonged to your friend, Adam? Is that right?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我當時真的以為我拿的是亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Well… did you… do you remember what’s the color or the shape of the umbrella?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.

zh-TW	是的…在我離開博物館的時候，我跟…我身旁有我的教授，還有我兩位同學，那我教授當時還原本要…就是借我他的傘。因為我教授他的傘蠻小的，所以我就沒有接受，因為我不想要淋濕。那我兩個同學都在旁邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Therefore, the three witness should… be able to be here as the witness for you verify what you just stated.

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	在當時，我試著想要把傘還給陳小姐，但是他不願意接受，那在當時我也試著想要跟他道歉，可是他也不願意接受我的道歉，那在當時我的教授以及我兩個同學都在一旁，那他們應該可以證實我說的是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	I understand that, then the plaintiff, what happened that day. Ms. Chen, could you tell us what happened that day?

en-US	At that time… on that day, I visit Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. And I put my umbrella on the rack, but I came out of the museum, I found that my umbrella was gone. I ask the staff of the museum to find the umbrella for me, and after a while, I saw the foreigner put my umbrella back on the rack. And I found out… the umbrella he returned was mine, and I was… I was furious. How could someone so shameful that knowing it was raining and he took some else umbrella?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What’s the color or some… something special about the umbrella? Could you tell us the color or anything special about the umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。

en-US	Now, I’m going to show you the investigatory file, on page 5, the pictures…the plaintiff, could you tell us, in the picture, does the umbrella belong to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	In the photo, the umbrella is very common and very ordinary, and that is the kind of umbrella you can buy in 7-11. How could you be so sure that the umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, my umbrella was bought in 7-11, but the umbrella… the umbrella I brought that day, the button was a little bit broken, so it cannot be… button up. On that day, when I was making the court script, I tell the police the same thing that my umbrella… the button on my umbrella was broken, so it cannot be button up. And the umbrella the foreigner put back on the rack has the same signature… has the same characteristic.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Would you… forgive the defendant if the defendant show some regret and they apologize to you. Are you willing to forgive him? After all, it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by that was just an umbrella? It is an issue of morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella for me, then I have to want home without my umbrella, and it was raining on that day.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Okay… I understand. Then we will subpoena the three witness… the defendant just mentioned. And the next proceeding will set at 3 P.M… 3 o’clock in the afternoon, on June 25th, 2018. And in the next proceeding, there will be the three witness the defendant just mentioned and ask us to subpoena. The defendant… are you okay with the date?

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The time of the incident is on May 27th, 2018. The defendant Paul Anderson went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and stole the accuser Xiaoqian Chen’s umbrella. Because the defendant Paul Anderson didn’t inform the accuser, and when the accuser returned the umbrella to the original spot, he was caught on the spot. So the accuser filed a lawsuit to the defendant Paul Anderson. In today’s procedure, the court mainly wants to understand what happened on May 27th, 2018. And we will ask the both party to clarify the situation on that day. And do the both party understand the procedure today? Also, I will ask the accuser to know more about the details on May 27th, 2018. Do the both party understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand too.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Where were you at 4:15 pm, on May 27th, 2018?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館裡面

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time, did you see the accuser Ms. Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，當我把雨傘歸還到架子上時，陳小姐就在旁邊

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	And, what happened at that time? 

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	當時，她對我大吼然後說我偷她的傘，我試圖想跟她解釋，應該是我拿錯了，但她不理我。我試著要跟她道歉，但她都不聽解釋。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我是跟同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽，當我們看完最後一個展物的時候，其中兩個同學跟我說他們很餓，所以我們就打算出去找一些吃的，然後去吃晚餐。當時，當我要走出去覓食的時候，我發現外面下雨了。因為我沒有帶傘，所以我就想跟其中一個同學借傘。因為我長得比較高、比較大一隻，我就想跟亞登借傘，因為他的體型跟我比較像，所以我就跟他借傘。然後我就從架上拿了一把傘，我就跟我的一位教授跟其他兩位同學出去買一些麵包。那當我回來的時候我把傘歸還時，陳小姐就對我大吼了，這就是當時的狀況。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Well, so did you mean that the umbrella you borrowed belog to your friend Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我是以為那把傘就是Adam他所帶的那把，我完全沒有想偷別人傘的意思。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	What color and shape of umbrella that you borrowed on that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得我當時借的那把傘是藍色的，但它不是全新的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the color of the umbrella all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我印象當中，它是全部都藍色的沒錯。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Did anyone can prove what you said is true?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，當時跟我同行去買晚餐的的教授跟同學可以為我作證。當時，教授甚至有看到我借了Adam的那把傘。那是因為教授的傘比較小，我不希望身體弄濕，所以我就沒有跟她借。然後跟我同行的其他兩位同學也知道這件事。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, did the three person, your professor, and two of your classmates can come to the proceeding and speak up for you?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	是，我想應該是這樣沒錯

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you want the prosecutor to investigate any further evidence for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	當時，當我把傘歸還的時候，陳小姐對我大吼，不想聽我說的任何話。她也不接受我的道歉，我想我的教授及兩位同學能夠到庭為我解釋，能夠證明我說的話是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Well, then I will ask the accuser to clarify the details of the incident on that day?Miss Chen, can you briefly describe what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	On that day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was a rainy day, and I put my umbrella on the rack outside the museum. When I went out the museum, and I found my umbrella was gone. Then I asked the curators of the museum to help me find my umbrella, and I saw the defendant just came back and returned my umbrella to the rack. When I found out that the foreigner took my umbrella. And it was he stole my umbrella, so I was very angry and asked him why he stole my umbrella? Didn’t he know that it was raining outside ? and why he didn’t have a conscience? 

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Miss Chen, what color is your umbrella? And does your umbrella have any traits?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day is blue, and I think it’s deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Show exhibit evidence, page fifteen, is the picture on the file your umbrella?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	In the picture, the umbrella is just very normal one, that people can buy from 7-11.How can you confirm that umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, my umbrella was bought from 7-11, but in my umbrella, its button is a little bit damaged, and I cannot close my umbrella well. When I reported to the police, I had described the details of this matter. Because the umbrella that the foreigner returned to the track also had the button trait, so I can prove that the umbrella was mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Well, the accuser, if the defendant has regretted what he had done and apologized to you, will you forgive him? After all, the stole item is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that just an umbrella? Is the defendant don’t have a     conscience, and what if he didn’t return the umbrella to the rack, so that I have to go back home under the big rain, you know that? So I won’t forgive him even he apoliogizes.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Well, I see. So I will subpoena three witnesses to the court and ask them what happened on that day. And the next proceeding will be held at 3 pm on June 25th, 2018. In the next proceeding, the defendant and the three witnesses will come to the proceeding and will clarify the details of the incident. Does the time of the next proceeding you can come to the court?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我那個時間可以到庭

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The accuser, Miss Chen, in the next proceeding, you can choose whether to come to the court, because we mainly want to ask the defendant and the three witnesses the details of that day. You are fine to come to the proceeding if you want.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I won’t come to the next proceeding, because I have to take a day off my work.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	OK, I understand. Then today’s proceeding is adjourned. After you signed the court script, and you can leave.

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why Ms. Chen said that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

zh-TW	是的，當我出來時有位教授跟兩位同學跟著我，而教授還打算把他的傘借給我，因為他的雨傘比較小，所以我沒跟他借，因為我不想被淋濕，而我當時另外兩個同學也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?

zh-TW	我嘗試把傘還給陳小姐，但他不接受，而我也嘗試跟他道歉，但他也一樣不接受，或許當天我的同學以及教授可以幫我證明這段話。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Okay, now I want to ask Ms. Chen what happened that day. Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened that day?

en-US	I went to the ceramic museum that day, and when I go there, it’s raining. And I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. When I come back, the umbrella was not there. I ask the staff to help me, and then I saw this foreigner put it back. When I realized the umbrella he put back was mine, I was very angry. I ask him did you know it’s raining now?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	I should be the dark blue one.

en-US	Yes, this is mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on the picture is common. It’s sold in every 711 stores. How could you say that it is yours? How did you recognize it?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought it in 711, but …the bottom on my umbrella was broke. So that cannot be closed. I explained to the police at that time. And the umbrella that foreigner put back has this description as I said.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Then if he is…if the defendant is regret about that and he will apologize to you, will you forget him? After all, it is an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it is just an umbrella. It’s about the moral issue. It was raining that day, so if he took the umbrella, I’ll pour in rain that day.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

en-US	The accused, the time was happened on May 27th 2018, and happened at Yingge Ceramics Museum. The accuser Xiaoqian Chen prosecuted you for her taking her umbrella without asking her, and after Xiaoqian Chen found you and umbrella at the same time. Today’s procedure is mainly for the court to know what happened at that time. Please answer all the questions to the prosecutor and the court for them to have more understanding of the whole incident. Do you understand? And later I will also ask the accuser to state…to all the parties…involved parties know the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	The accused, I want to ask where were you at 4:15 May 27th 2018 ?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time did you see the accuser Xiaoqian Chen…at that time?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的當我把傘放進傘桶後就看到她。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對著我大吼說我偷走她的傘，而我只是想告訴她我拿錯了傘，我試著道歉，但她不想聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did Miss Chen said you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我後幾位同學去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館，在參觀完一些展覽之後我們肚子就有點餓，就想出去買個食物順便找一下晚餐的吃飯的地點，當我走出去博物館時就發現正在下雨，所以我就向我的同學借一把傘，因為我的體型比較高大，所以我當時是想跟Adam(我的一個同學)借傘，因為他的體型和我比較相似，於是我傘桶拿出一把傘，並且和一位教授、兩個同學去買麵包，當我回來時，就遇到Miss Chen 在傘桶旁邊對我大吼。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	What did you mean as that the umbrella is borrowed from your classmates Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的我當時認為我是借他的傘，我並沒有意圖去偷或拿走任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember the color, the shape of the umbrella you took at that time?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得是藍色的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is that umbrella filled with blue on the surface?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我認知中，它是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can somebody prove what you have said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的我的教授與兩位朋友可以為我證明，我教授甚至想要借我他的傘，因為教授的傘比較小，怕會因此而淋濕，因此沒有跟他借，我當時兩位同學都在那邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Then, the professor and two of your friends can come to the court to prove what you have said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Then do you have any case for court to investigate for your evidence?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著把傘還她，並且對她道歉，但她都無法接受，我相信我的教授與兩位朋友能夠到庭證明我的清白，還有證明我說的都是事實。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	I see. Now I’ll ask Miss Chen for what...for the case at that time.Miss Chen, could you explain what happend at that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I visited the Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was rainy that day, so after I went into the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. When I came out of the museum, it was gone! I ask the assistance from the museum to help me to find my umbrella, but after that I saw this foreigner hold my umbrella. When I realized he was holding my umbrella, I ask him angrily why he stole my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was rainy? And didn’t he have any kind of…

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	 What’s the color of your umbrella? And does it has any…features?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day was blue. It’s dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	 Let’s look at the exhibition 1. Now you see the picture is that umbrella belong from you ?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is just very common. Everyone can buy that in 7-11, the convenience store. How could you so confidence that is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s true my umbrella was brought at 7-11, but the button of my umbrella has some broken. It is hard to push it…push the button. I have explained this for the police when I was at the police station. And also, the accused… the umbrella accused at that time has this feature, so that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the accused is regretted about his behavior also apologize with you, could you just forget this case? In case this is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it is just an umbrella? It is a very important sense of humanity. Do you know at that day if I don’t have an umbrella, you tell me that I just walk in the rain and go home without an umbrella?

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I see, we will send the ticket to subpoena the witness for the next procedure and our procedure was set at 3:00 pm June 25th 2018. The accuser and the witness have to come to the court. The accuser, is this time available for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的我到時候會出庭

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, the accuser, you can…decide whether you want to come to the court next time because our next procedure was mainly to ask the witness of the accused to explain the whole situation at that time.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I won’t come. If I come here, I have to take off from my work.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. And this is today’s procedure…the procedure is dismissed. Please sign the court script then you can leave the court.

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他當時對我大吼，說我偷了他的雨傘，我嘗試跟他解釋說，我並沒有偷他的傘，我只是拿錯了傘，我試圖跟他道歉，但他不想聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining.

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	在那天，我和我同學一起去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽，看完展覽之後，我的同學跟我說，他們有點餓，於是我們想出去買些吃的，甚至是找個地方能讓我們來吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，我發現正在下雨，而我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想說我要跟我的同學借一把傘，因為我的體型比較高大，所以我想像我的朋友Adam借傘，因為他的體型跟我差不多，於是我拿著傘和教授和兩個同學去買麵包，當我回來時，陳小姐就在那裏對我大吼。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Well, do you meant that the umbrella you borrowed was from your friend, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我當時以為我拿的雨傘是Adam的。我並沒有想要偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Then, did you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you take at that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，那把傘是藍色的，而且不是一把很新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella wholly in blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶裡，那支傘是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone could verify your statement?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，當我和我的教授和兩位同學離開博物館時，我的教授還打算把他的傘借給我，而因為他的傘比較小，所以我沒有跟他借，因為我不想讓他淋濕，而我另外兩名同學也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Then, three of them could come to the court and help you verify what you just stated, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想應該是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any evidence that would like the court to help you investigate?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我嘗試把傘還給陳小姐，但他不接受，我也嘗試向陳小姐道歉，他也不接受。或許我的同學和教授能幫我證明我今天所說的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, now I would like to ask Ms. Chen about what happened at that day. Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened at that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	At that particular day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was raining. I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack in the front door. And when I come back, the umbrella was gone. I asked the museum staff to help me find the umbrella, and I saw this foreigner put the umbrella back on the rack. When I realized the umbrella he took was mine, I was very angry；I ask him “Didn’t he know it was raining out there? Did he even has any conscious? “

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Please describe the color and the shape of the umbrella that you brought to the museum at that day.

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	Well, the umbrella I took to the museum was blue. I believe it was in the deep blue color.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now, I would like to show Exhibit 1 page 5. Is the umbrella on this picture yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is merely a regular umbrella. It is the kind of umbrella that you could easily get in a 7-11 store. How could you be so sure that this is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, of course, I bought my umbrella at 7-11 store. However, the button of my umbrella is a little bit broken so that it cannot be packed properly. I explain this point to the Police specifically at that time, and the umbrella that the foreigner put back on the rack matched the description. So I believed that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Then, if the defendant has showed remorse and apologize to you. Would you be willing to forgive him? Because it is merely an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it is only an umbrella? I think this is a basic moral issue. If he didn’t return the umbrella, how would I be able to go home? What? Did he want me to go home under pouring rain?

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	那天我跟我的兩位同學去看展覽，在我們看完以後，我同學他們覺得很餓，所以我想說我們去買些食物，找個地方來吃晚餐。當我們要離開博物館時，外面正在下雨，我當時沒有帶雨傘，我就跟我同學借一把。因為我有點身材有點高大，所以我跟我同學亞當借雨傘，因為他的體身形比較寬，跟我比較相似。於是我從雨傘架上拿了雨傘，我去幫我教授們買了麵包，我回來之後就看到陳小姐對著我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?

zh-TW	我只記得雨傘顏色是藍的，然後並不是很新

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the umbrella all in blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象中，雨傘是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can someone that prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，我當時跟著教授還有兩位同學走出來。當時我教授想要借我雨傘。因為他的雨傘比較小，而我不想要淋濕，所以我選擇跟我另外兩位同學借。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Then three of them can come to the court to help you verify right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any evidence for the prosecutor to help you investigate in?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我想要把雨傘還給陳小姐，但她並不接受。我也想要跟她道歉，但她也不領情。我想我的教授跟我的兩位同學可以幫我做證吧。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, so I would like to ask Mrs. Chen what happened on that day. Mrs. Chen, could you tell me what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went Yingee Ceramics Museum that day, it was raining, so I put my umbrella in the rack. After I came out, my umbrella was gone. I ask the janitor of the museum to help me find it. But after I saw this foreigner, and I saw my umbrella. When I discovered that my umbrella was taken by him, I was so angry. I ask him why did you take my umbrella? Do you know it’s raining outside now? How can you behave like this? Do you have any moral ethics?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What’s the color of your umbrella, and did it have any special features?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day is blue, I guess it’s a dark blue umbrella.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please show the exhibit one. Mrs. Chen, is that the umbrella you brought that day?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it was the umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture was just a common one. And you can buy it form anywhere like 7-11. How can you be so sure that it was yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	That’s true, that was the umbrella I bought from 7-11, and there are some damages around the button on the umbrella. At that time, I told the police about the damage on the button, and it was put on the rack, after which was taken by this guy.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Then, if the other party would like to apologize, and he knew that he was wrong. Could you forgive him since it was just an umbrella?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What did you mean that it’s just an umbrella? Do you know that what the situation was? It’s raining big outside. Did you want to go back home without any umbrella?

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Oh, I see. Well, I will send the subpoena to the three witness, and the next proceeding will be set at 3:00p.m., june 25th, 2018. The defendant and three witness will come to the court. The defendant, is the date ok with you?

zh-TW	是的，我會到庭

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Mrs, Chen, you can either show up or not on that day since we are going to ask three witnesses about what happened that day.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, because I don’t want to take the other day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand, so today’s proceeding was off. Both parties, please sign up in here.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The incident happened on May 27th, 2018. The defendant Paul Anderson took Xiao-Cian Chen’s umbrella at Yingge Ceramics Museum. The defendant did not inform the accuser of taking her umbrella. When the defendant returned the umbrella to Xiao-Cian Chen, she caught the defendant on spot. She then filed a lawsuit against Paul Anderson.The procedure today is mainly to understand what happened on that day. The court will ask questions.

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是，當我把雨傘放回去的時候，原告陳小倩在場。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened on that day?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她當時大叫說我偷了她的雨傘，但我只是錯拿了雨傘而已。我有試著要道歉，但她不願意聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did the accuser said you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和同學們去看展覽，看完展覽後有兩個同學說肚子餓了，我們決定去買晚餐，或是找個地方坐下來吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，發現下大雨了，我原本想和我的同學借傘。因為我的個子比較高、比較大隻，所以我決定和我的同學亞當借傘，他的身形和我比較像。我就從架子裡面拿了傘，然後和其他人去買麵包，當我回來的時候，原告陳小姐就對我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean the umbrella you borrowed at the time belongs to your classmate Adam.

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對我以為我拿的雨傘是亞當的，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember what’s the color and pattern of the umbrella?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色是藍色的，然後不是很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	The whole umbrella is blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶裡，它是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone can prove what you just stated is true?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有，當我出來的時候，我的教授和兩位同學都在，我教授原本還想要幫我撐傘，但是我覺得教授的傘太小了，我也不想要教授淋濕，其他兩位同學也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three people can come to the court and prove what you stated is true, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any other evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	當時我試著要還她傘，但她不願意拿；當時我也試著要道歉，但她不願意接受，我相信我的教授和兩位同學，都可以證明我所述為實。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Then I am going to ask Ms. Chen about what happened on that day.Ms. Chen could you describe the situation on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day. It was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack and when I get back, it was gone. I asked the workers in the museum to find for me and the foreigner just took the umbrella back. When I saw my umbrella in his hand, I was really angry. I asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining on that day? How could he do such an immoral thing?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What the color of the umbrella you took with you on that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took on that day was blue, dark blue.

en-US	Exbit1. Page5. The picture of the umbrella. Does the umbrella belong to you ?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s exactly my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	It’s a really normal umbrella. It’s sold at 7-11. How can you be so sure that it’s your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought this umbrella at 7-11. But my umbrella has some problems at the button. It’s kind of broken. It cannot really buckle up. When I reported this case, I did emphasize this to the police officers. And the umbrella he put back on the rack has this characteristic too.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant does show his regret and he apologizes sincerely. Would you consider forgiving him? Since it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by it’s just an umbrella? It’s an immoral thing. If he did not return the umbrella back, then I would have to get wet in the rain.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。

zh-TW	那天我和同學一起去看鶯歌陶瓷博物館的展覽。當我們看完那些物品之後，他們說覺得很餓，想要買食物來吃，所以我們想找個地方用晚餐。當我離開的時候，卻發現已經在下雨了。然後我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想跟同學借一把，我想要和我一位叫做Adam的朋友借雨傘，他的身型跟我的很像。所以我從架上拿一把傘然後跑去找我的教授跟朋友。當我回去的時候，陳小姐就在那裡。

en-US	If the defendant shows his regretness and he is willing to apologize to you, would you forgive him? It’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	Mr. Paul Anderson, you are prosecuted for theft. The time of the incident…the date of the incident was May 27th, 2018. At that day, you visit Yingge Ceramics Museum and borrow the plaintiff’s umbrella without telling her. And when you return the umbrella back, you are found by the plaintiff on the spot. And that’s the reason why you are prosecuted. Today we are mainly going to clarify what happened that day, so please answer the questions I ask so the prosecutors can understand what actually happened that day. Understand? Later I will also ask the plaintiff what happened that day. Do both party understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, when were you at 4:15 p.m., on May 27th , 2018.

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我那時候在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有，我把雨傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐就在那裏。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大叫，說我偷她的傘，我試著解釋我應該是拿錯傘了，我沒有要偷傘。我還試著跟她道歉，但是她不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why would say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和幾個同學到博物館看展覽，看完展覽之後，有些人說他餓了，所以我們決定出去買些吃的，也順便找在哪裡吃晚餐。要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了，但是我沒有帶傘，所以我決定要跟同學借一把傘。因為我身形比較高大一點，所以我決定跟我的同學，他叫亞當，我決定跟他借傘，因為他的身形跟我差不多。所以我從傘架上拿了把傘，然後出去買麵包，跟我的教授和兩位朋友一起，而當我走回去傘架的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean the umbrella you borrowed is from your friend, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我以為那把傘就是亞當的，我並無意偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Then did you remember what color the umbrella you took was?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得它是…我只記得它的顏色，藍色，而且沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	The whole umbrella is blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	我印象中傘是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Does anyone can prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有的，我走出博物館的時候，一位教授和兩位同學都在我旁邊，教授甚至還想借我她的傘，但是教授的傘比較小，所以我沒有跟她借，我不想讓教授淋濕，其他兩位朋友在旁邊也有看到。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So these three people can come to the court and prove what you said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想可以吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any evidence that you want the prosecutor offices to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我當時試著把傘還給陳小姐，她不接受。我試著跟她道歉，她也不聽。我想我的教授和兩位同學應該可以到庭作證我說的都是事實。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok. Next, I am going to ask Ms. Chen about what happened that day. Ms. Chen, can you describe what had happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	That day I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was raining, and when I…before I went into the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. However, when I came out, my umbrella is gone. I ask the staff of the museum to look for my umbrella for me. Then I saw this foreigner come back with my umbrella. When I found that he had my umbrella, I was very mad. I ask him angrily why he took my umbrella. It was raining! Didn’t he have any moral ideas?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What was the color of the umbrella you brought that day? Does it have any features?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	It was blue, maybe dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now we are going to display the picture on page 5, investigatory file 1. Is it your umbrella?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is an ordinary one. You can get it in a convenience store. How can you determine that it was your umbrella.

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought it at seven-eleven, but the button of my umbrella is a little broken. When I report the case to the police, I have explained this point. And the umbrella which the foreign returned back to the rack has the same feature. From this, we can know that it was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant regrets it and is willing to apologize, would you forgive him? After all, it was just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by it was just an umbrella? It’s about moral. If he didn’t return the umbrella back, I would have to go home in the heavy rain! I wouldn’t forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Oh…ok. Then the court will subpoena the defendant’s professor and the two friends. The next proceeding is set to be at 3 p.m., June 25th, 2018. The defendant and the three witness should be appear in the court…should appear in the court. Defendant, would this date be ok?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	可以，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The plaintiff, the next proceeding, you can either come or not come. Next time we will mainly ask the defendant and his professor and two classmates, so either you come or not is ok.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	Then I won’t come. I would have to take a day-off if I come.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. Then the court is adjourned. Please sign the court script before you leave.

en-US	The defendant, Paul Anderson, on the time of… at 27th, May, 2018, the location was at Yingge Ceramics Museum in New Taipei City. You are found to take an umbrella without the owner’s permission, and you didn’t inform the accuser, and when you return the umbrella, you were found by the accuser, 陳小倩, that you took away her umbrella, so she decided to sue you.The purpose of today’s procedure is to understand what happened that day, and the judge and the prosecutor will ask you questions to understand what happened that day. Do you understand the procedure?And then later, the court will ask the accuser to describe what happened that day, do the both parties understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	The defendant, where were you at 4:15 pm, on 27th May 2018?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time, did you see the accuser, Ms. Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，我有看見。當我把傘放回架上的時候，我有看到她。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	Then what happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	那個時候陳小姐大聲地對我叫喊，說我偷了他的傘，但是那個時候我努力地跟他解釋我一定只是拿錯傘了，我並沒有偷他的傘。我試著要跟他解釋，但她不聽我講。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why does Ms. Chen say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那個時候我和我的同學去陶瓷博物館看展覽，那個時候看完展覽的一些東西之後，我的兩個同學就說他們餓了，所以我們決定去外面買東西，我們還想要在外面找個地方吃晚餐。正當我要離開博物館的時候，我發現外面正在下雨，但是我發現我沒有帶傘，然後我就決定我要跟我同學借傘，因為我比較高，看起來比較大隻，所以我決定要跟我的同學艾迪借傘，因為他也比較大隻，跟我的身型比較接近。然後我就從架上拿走了一把傘，然後跟我的一個教授跟兩個同學出去買麵包，當我回來的時候，我就看到陳小姐在對著我大喊。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	So do you mean that the umbrella you took is from your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我拿的那把傘是我同學亞當的，我以為那把傘是他的，我覺得我沒有偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember what color the umbrella you took was and what shaper it is?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得他是一把藍色的傘，而且他並不新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella whole blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我印象中，他是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Do you have anyone that can prove what you stated is true?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，當時我出來的時候，我的同學和教授也在我旁邊，當時我的教授還想要借我傘，因為那個教授說他的傘有點小，所以我就拒絕了，我沒有拿，因為我不想要他淋濕，當時我的另外兩個同學也在那邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So those three people can come to the court to prove that what you said is true right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have anything you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我有想要嘗試要還陳小姐傘，但他不肯拿。我也想要嘗試跟陳小姐道歉，但他不接受，我想我的教授和我的同學都能夠說明我說的是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok so next I’m going ask Ms. Chen some questions. Ms. Chen, could you please describe the situation that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum, and I found that it was raining outside. When I get into the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. And then when I came out of the museum, I found that my umbrella disappeared. I ask the staff of the museum help me to find my umbrella, but when I went out of the museum, I found that there was a foreigner putting my umbrella back.When I found that it is the foreigner that took away my umbrella, I was mad. And then I questioned him, didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How can a person so immoral?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What is the color of your umbrella you bring that day? And is there anything special on your umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I bring that day was blue. And it was deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	I’m going to show you the investigatory file, the picture on page five. Ms. Chen, please check if it is your umbrella.

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is very ordinary. It is the kind of umbrella that you can buy in 7-11. How can you be sure that it is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, my umbrella was bought at 7-11. But there is a characteristics on my umbrella. My button on my umbrella didn’t work very well. It can’t really fix on the umbrella. About this point, I explained to the police. When that foreigner putting back the umbrella on the rack, I found that the umbrella he took also has same characteristics as my umbrella. So I can sure that that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Ms. Chen, if the defendant have the sincerity of regression, and he is willing to apologize to you, then would you accept his apology? After all, it is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it is an umbrella? I think that it is about a person’s basic moral. If I didn’t have a umbrella that day, that means I’m going to be wet on that big raining day. I don’t want to accept his apology.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Oh ok, I see. So next the court will send subpoenas to the three people and ask them to be on the court to explain what happened that day. The date of next court is set at 3pm, June 25th, 2018. The defendant and the three people have to be on the court. The defendant, is the date okay for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我可以到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The accuser, Ms. Chen, you don’t have to be on the next court, but if you want to come, that is okay too. Because the main purpose of next court is to ask the classmates and the professor of the defendant to ask them what happened that day.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I won’t be here. Because I would have to take one day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I see. Today’s court is adjourned. Please sign the court script and you can leave.

When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天，我去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽，然後看完展覽之後，我跟我兩個同行的朋友就說肚子很餓，想要出去找一些食物吃，但是當我們要走出博物館的時候，才發現突然下雨了，但是我身上又沒有帶傘，然後打算向我朋友借一把，因為我身材比較高大，所以我決定跟我朋友亞當借傘，因為他身形跟我類似，於是，我就從傘架上拿了那一支傘，然後想說待會買一點東西，馬上就歸還，當我回到現場的時候，陳小姐就對著我吼叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	So, do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed at that time was your classmate’s, Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我以為我當時借的傘就是亞當的，我根本並沒有想要去拿別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember what was the color and the shape of the umbrella you borrowed that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，蠻舊的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象當中，它是藍色的沒錯。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is anyone can prove your words you just said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，當那天走出來的時候，教授和其他兩個同學都在場，教授甚至說要借我傘，但是那把傘好像太小了，所以我就跟她講，可能要向另外一個同學借傘。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, the three people can be court to prove what you just said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	是的。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	So, do you have any evidence you want the police to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我想要把傘還給陳小姐，但是她都不接受，我也想誠心地跟她道歉，但是她也都不聽，我想我的教授跟其他兩位同學應該能替我作證吧。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK, now I am going to ask some details to Ms. Chen on that day.Ms. Chen, could you elaborate what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	That day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. However, it was rainy. So, when I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack. However, when I wanted to leave, I found my umbrella gone. I asked the museum staff to help me, at the same time, I found the foreign turn my umbrella back. When I realized that the umbrella he took was my umbrella, I was really angry. Did he know it was rainy? So, how could he take my umbrella away?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What’s the color or other features of the umbrella you brought that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day might be blue, I think it’s dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Show the evidence 1, page 5. In the picture, is your umbrella?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is very common. It can be found in every convenience store. How could you make sure the umbrella is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought my umbrella in 7-11 convenience store. However, the button of my umbrella is kind of broken. So, I can make sure that’s my umbrella. At that time, I said to the police, and the umbrella the foreign turned back the button of the umbrella was also broken. So, I can make sure he stole my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the other party has regrets and also is willing to apologize, are you willing to forgive him? After all, what you lost is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? It’s a matter of our values and moral. On that day, if he didn’t turn back my umbrella, so do you want me to go home without umbrella? I didn’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Oh, I understand. So, the court will subpoena the three witnesses. And the next court is set on 6/25 in 2018. The time is 3:00 P.M. The defendant and the three witnesses should be court. The defendant, do you understand the procedure? And the time is OK for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會準時出席的。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Ms. Chen, you can be next court or not be next court. In the next proceeding, we will ask the three witnesses, including the professor and other classmates.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I won’t be here. If I am here, I need to take another day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. So, the procedure is dismissed. Please sign on the court script before leave, thanks.

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time, did you see the accuser, Ms. Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，當我把雨傘還回架上後，陳小姐就在那邊了。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened then?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她站在那邊對我大叫，說我偷了她的傘，我告訴她我只是不小心拿錯而已。我沒有偷。我試著向她道歉，但她不接受。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did Ms. Chen say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和我同學一起去博物官參觀一個展覽，看完展覽後我們感到有些餓，所以我們就決定去買食物，甚至是去尋覓晚餐。當我要離開博物館的時候，我發現外面正在下雨，所以我就決定向我同學借一把雨傘。因為我有點高，所以我就像我同學一位叫亞當斯的借，因為他的身型和體型都和我很像。我從架上拿了一把雨傘和教授和兩位朋友去買了麵包。當我買回來的時候，陳小姐就對我大叫了。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed then was from your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的。我以為當時那把傘是我同學亞當斯的。我並沒有意圖要偷那個傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Could you recall the color of the umbrella you took then?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色而已。是藍色的然後沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the umbrella all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我印象中是藍色的沒錯。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone proof what you just said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，可以。當時我和我的教授和兩位朋友離開博物館時，我教授甚至還問我要不要借我雨傘，因為她雨傘太小，我就不打算跟她借了。我不想要她淋濕。我那兩位同學當時也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	I assume that the three of them can come to the court and clarify your statement, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate on your behalf?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我當時試著還給她雨傘，她不收。我跟她道歉，她也不接受。我想我的教授們跟兩位同學都能幫我做證這點。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	I see. Now I’m going to ask Ms. Chen what happened that day.Ms. Chen, can you tell me what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day. It was raining outside. So when I enterd the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack, and then I found out it was gone. I asked the members of the museum to help me find my umbrella. I found out that this foreigner took my umbrella. I realized the umbrella he was taking is the one I lost. I was very angry. How could anyone do such thing when they know it was raining outside?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Ms. Chen what is the color and the feature of your umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	My umbrella was dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Page 5 of the investigatory file… the evidence used in the case, is the umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on that photo was a very common one. It was an umbrella anyone can get at 7-11. How can you proof that it was your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, it was brought from 7-11. My umbrella is kind of broken because the button of the umbrella doesn’t work well. I told the police this feature of my umbrella. And when the foreigner put back the umbrella, that umbrella did has this kind of feature.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the other party is willing to apologize and he is regretful, will you forgive him? Since it was only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it was only an umbrella? It was something about integrity. If he didn’t bring back my umbrella, I have to walk back to my home without an umbrella.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Oh… okay, I see. I will subpoena his professor and two of his friends to the court. The next proceeding will be at 3pm June 25th. The defendant, do you understand?

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No. I am not going to come. I don’t want to take a leave.

When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那時候我跟我同學一起去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館的展覽。當我們看到了某兩件東西的時候，我的同學就說他有點餓，想吃點東西，所以我們就去外面尋找可以吃晚餐的地方。當我在博物館的時候，外面下著大雨，我當時就想說先跟我同學借把傘好了。因為我的體型比較高壯，那我就想說我的同學Adam身形也是這樣，所以我決定借了他的傘。當時我就拿了架上Adam的傘去買了麵包給我的教授和同學。當我回來的時候，陳小姐看到我就馬上大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	The defendant, do you mean that you borrowed Adam’s umbrella at that time, is that right?

zh-TW	是的，可以證明我的言詞的就是我的教授和同學，當時我和教授和同學一起出去買東西，然後教授也想借我傘。因為她的傘比較舊，所以我就沒有拿她的傘。當時我的教授和同學也都知道。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella is very ordinary and it may be bought in the 711 convenient store on that photo. How can you say that this is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, this umbrella was bought in the 711 convenient store and the button of the umbrella has some problems.When I report the incident to the police, I emphasized that feature…… and the foreigner did take the umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	The plaintiff, if the defendant has the regret and sincerely apologizes to you, could you forgive the foreigner? Because it was not a big deal, right?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	This umbrella is not ordinary. If I just the foreigner, in other words, it means that at that day I have to undertook the rain, so I don’t want to forgive the person?

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Ok, we will subpoena the three people to come to the court at 3 p.m. on 6/25 and the defendant and other witness should come to the court. Is that date, Ok, the defendant?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我可以。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not to come to here at the nest proceeding. In that day, I just want to ask the professor and classmates about the process of the incident.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I will not come to the court next time.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. This is the end of the procedure. Today’s procedure is adjourned and please both parties stay to write the court script.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The time was at May 27, 2018. The incident happened at Yingge Ceramics Museum in New Taipei city. You took Hsiao-Chien Chen’s umbrella without her permission. You were caught by her with her spot, and thus she pressed charges. Today’s procedure is mainly to understand what happened that day. Answer my questions so that we can understand the details of the incident. Do you understand? Later I’ll also ask the accuser about what happened that day. Do both understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	 I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, where were you at 4:15 pm. At May 27th 2018?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see Ms. Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，我把傘放回傘架的時候，就看到她了。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	And what happened then?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我大叫，說我偷了她的傘。我試著跟她說我拿錯傘了，並不是要偷，試著跟她道歉但她都不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	And why Ms. Chen said you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和幾個同學參觀博物館展覽，看完展覽之後，兩個同學說他餓了，所以就決定出去買東西，或許也找個地方晚餐。當我離開博物館，我發現外面下雨，但沒帶傘，所以想要跟同學借一把。因為我個頭較大，所以我決定去跟我一個朋友亞當借傘。他身形跟我差不多，後來我從傘架拿了傘，和我的教授和幾個朋友去買一些麵包。當我回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我吼叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean the umbrella you borrowed was Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我以為我拿的傘是亞當的，我並沒有要偷傘的意思。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you took?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，是藍色，不是全新的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is it all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	我印象中是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone who can prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，我走出博物館的時候，教授和其他兩個同學都和我在一起，我的教授甚至借我她的傘。因為她的傘太小了，我沒辦法撐，又不想要她被淋溼。另外兩個同學也在那裏。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So those three people could help you to prove what you just said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	What any else evidence do you hope the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著還陳小姐傘但她不要，跟她道歉她也不聽，也許我的教授和朋友可以證明我今天說的都是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK, now I would like to ask Ms. Chen about the details of the incident.Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge museum. It was rainy. When I entered it, I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I came out, it was gone.I asked the staff to help me find it. Then I saw the foreigner take it back.When I discovered the umbrella he took was mine, I felt angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was rainy outside? How can somebody be so selfish?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What color was the umbrella you took? Is there anything special on it?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	What I took was blue. I think it was deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Picture on the page 5of exhibit 1, is that umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella is the ordinary one. That can be bought at 7-11. How could you be sure that umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, that was bought at 7-11, but the button on my umbrella is a little bit damaged, a little bit hard to buckle it up.About this point, I have specially explained to the police. The umbrella that the foreigner took back had this feature. Therefore, I am sure that’s mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Then I ask you, if the other party shows regrets and is willing to apologize, will you forgive him? After all, that is only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean “only an umbrella?” that is a basic moral problem. Had he not returned the umbrella, I would have to walk home in the pouring rain? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	OK, I see. We will subpoena the three witnesses just mentioned to ask them about what happened that day. The next court is set at 3 pm. on June 25th, 2018. The defendant and the three witnesses should be here. The defendant, is that date OK with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	好的，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Ms. Chen. The next court you can choose to be here or not. Basically people whom we’ll ask are the classmates and the professor who were with the defendant that day. If you would like to come, welcome.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	It’s not necessary. I don’t want to ask another day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	The defendant, the accuser, Miss Chen, she said the incident happened on May 27th, 2018 and the situation is that you took her umbrella and did not inform her (you took her umbrella without notification… of her) so when you returned the umbrella back, she caught you immediately, and so she reported the case to the police and then filed the lawsuit. So, today, the procedure will focus on what you did that day, and the defendant, we need you to tell us what happened on that day and answer our questions, do you understand?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，當我把雨傘放回架子上，我就看到她了。

zh-TW	她對著我大吼、大聲喊叫，說我是小偷，偷了她的傘，但我想我一定是拿錯把了。我有試圖道歉，但她不接受。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天，我和我同學一起去博物館看展，當我們看完所有的展品時，我有兩…我其中兩個同學覺得很餓，所以我們決定找個地方吃晚餐。當我們要離開時，外面下雨了，可是我剛好沒有帶雨傘，所以我想跟我同學借傘。因為我身材比較高大，所以我向我其中一位同學，亞當，借傘，他的身形跟我比較像。於是我就從架子上 借 了一把傘，然後和我的教授跟我同學一起去買食物這樣，當我們回來後，陳小姐就對著我們大吼。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Are you saying that the umbrella you borrowed was… did it belong to your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對阿，我以為那把傘是亞當的傘啊。我真的沒有有意要去偷人家的東西。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember what… the shape and the color of the umbrella… you took?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色是藍色而已，而且不是很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the umbrella all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我印象中，應該是，沒錯。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Could anyone prove your word?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	我想，有。當我們走出博物館時，我的教授跟我的兩個同學和我一起走的，我的教授甚至借了我她的傘。因為教授的傘比較小把一點，但我也不想讓教授淋濕，所以我就沒有借了。當時另外兩個同學也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, can the three people come to the court to verify your word?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	應該可以吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我有試著把雨傘還給陳小姐，也有試圖向她道歉，可是她都不肯接受。我想我同行的那三人可以幫我佐證我的話，告知整個事發的經過。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Well, I see. Then, now the court is going to ask Miss Chen what happened on that day.Miss Chen, could you tell us what happened on that day?

I ask for help from the faculty of the museum, and after that, I saw this guy put my umbrella back into the rack. When I found that it was… this guy took the umbrella that I thought was stolen, I questioned him… You didn’t know there was rain outside? Are you crazy? ......

en-US	The umbrella in the picture, it is the kind that we can buy from a convenience store. It’s really common. How can you recognize that it is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	It is true I bought the umbrella at a convenience store. And… there is something different with my umbrella. A button was broken. It can’t match… I told the police about the button things, and so… I found that this guy return the same umbrella with the same button problem, so I knew it was him stole my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Well, if the other party has the sense… if the other party will apologize with regrets, can you forgive him? It was just only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	An umbrella? What do you mean “an umbrella”? Do you know how the situation is completely out of control of moral? It was a rainy day. Heavy rain. Do you know the situation?

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	Mr. Paul Anderson, on May 27th, 2018, you visit the Yingge Ceramic Meseum, and you took the plaintiff, Xiaoqian Chen’s umbrella without notifying her. And…and when you tried to return the umbrella, she found the…she found your action. Therefore, she file a law suit against you.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	The defendant, where were you at 4:15 p.m. on May 17th, 2018?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time, did you see the plaintiff, Miss. Xiaoqian Chen.

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，當我把雨傘放回架上的時候，我有看到她。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	Then what happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她大叫著說我偷了她的雨傘，我也嘗試跟她講說我並沒要偷他的傘，我只是拿錯傘了。我試著跟她道歉，但她不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Then why Miss. Chen said that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天，我跟幾個同學一起去博物館參觀一個展覽，到一半的時候，我同學突然說肚子餓了，所以我們決定出去買點東西，也許順便會吃個晚餐。當我們走出博物館的時候，我們發現外面在下雨，我沒有帶傘，所以當時想說要借我其中一個同學的傘。因為我比較高大，所以我想說借跟我差不多身型的艾登的傘，他的傘跟我的很像。然後我就帶著那個傘，還有我的教授跟兩個朋友一起去買東西，當我買了麵包回來的時候，就遇到了陳小姐，她就開始對著我大叫

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Well do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed is your classmate’s, Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我當時以為那把傘是我朋友的，我並沒有想要去偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella you borrowed at…on that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，是藍色的，而且並不是新的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella fully blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象中，它是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone back up your words?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，當時我離開博物館的時候有我的教授跟兩位同學跟我同行，其中我的教授甚至還說要救我他的傘。但是因為他的傘對我來講太小了，我不想要淋濕，所以就婉拒了，當時我另外兩個同學也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three people you mentioned they can come to the court and support what you said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是的

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	What else do you want the investigator…the prosecutor to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著要還陳小姐傘。但他不要；我也有試著跟她道歉，但她也不應。也許我的教授跟兩位同學能夠來佐證我今天所說的話都是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok. Now I am going to ask Miss. Chen what happened on that day. Miss. Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day. It was rainy. And when I…when I was leaving the museum I…when I went into the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I was leaving the museum, I found my umbrella was lost I asked the staff in the museum for help, and at that time, I saw the foreigner tried to return my umbrella to the rack. When I found that the umbrella he took was the one that I lost, I was very angry. Didn’t she know…didn’t he know that the outside was rainy? How can he do that?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What color was the umbrella you took on that day? And can you say anything specific?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took on that day was blue. I think it was deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Investigatory file 1, page 5. Is the umbrella…the…is the picture’s umbrella…is the umbrella in the picture the one that you lost?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on the picture was very ordinary. And maybe you can buy…buy anything…any umbrella like this in 7-11. How can you certainly say that it was yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought my umbrella in 7-11. But the bottom of my umbrella was a little bit broken, so I can…so I am sure that was my umbrella. When I reported to the police, I …I no…I mentioned this point. The umbrella like the foreigners returned to the rack, I found this on that umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the other party was regret and he was…is willing to apologize to you, will you pardon him? After all, it was only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it was just an umbrella? It was the…the problem about his personality. If he didn’t return the umbrella, I will get wet and I couldn’t…I couldn’t go home. I do not want to pardon him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Ok, I understand. I will send the paper to the other …to the other three persons. And our next court will be set at 3 p.m. on June 25th, 2018. And the defendant and the three witness will be here. The defendant, is the date of our next court ok with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我能來。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss. Chen, you can be here on our next court. You can come or…or you don’t want to come, it’s up to you. Our next court will mainly focus on Asking what happened on that day…ask the other witness, the professor and classmates. But if you want to come, that’s fine.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I don’t want to take a day off on my work.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，我要把我的雨傘放回架上的時候，陳小倩在那裏。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對著我吼說我偷了他的雨傘，我試著告訴他我並沒有要偷他的雨傘，我應該只是不小心拿錯了。我試著向他道歉，但他聽不進去。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why would she accuse you of stealing her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟同學去博物館看展覽，我們看完後，我其中兩個同學說他們餓了，我們就決定外出覓食，順便尋找晚餐要在哪裡吃。在我要離開的時候我發現下雨了，因為我沒有帶雨傘，所以我打算借一支我同學的雨傘。因為我比較高大，所以我決定借我同學亞當的傘，因為他跟我體型一致。然後我就從架上拿了一支傘，跟教授和同學去買了一些麵包，當我回來時，陳小姐就開始對我吼叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	The umbrella that you took belonged to your classmate, Adam. Is that what you’re saying?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我當時以為我拿了亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the shape or the color that you took at that time?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色。那是一支藍色的傘，並沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象中，那支傘是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can someone verify your statements?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有的，在我離開博物館的時候，我的教授和兩名同學都跟著我離開，我的教授甚至有提說要不要借我他的傘。但因為他的傘比較小，所以我就沒有借，因為我不想要他也被雨淋濕，當時另外兩位同學也都在旁邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	I assume that those three people can come to the court to verify your statement. Is that right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想應該可以。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any further evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我當時試著要還陳小姐她的傘，但是他不願意拿。我當時也試著跟他道歉了，但是他也不接受。也許我的教授跟同學到庭後，可以幫助證明我的說詞是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	I see. Now let’s move on to Ms. Chen. I am going to ask you some questions regarding the incident happened on that day. Ms. Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day. It was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack outside. But when I got out of the museum, the umbrella was gone. I asked the staff members in the museum to help me find my umbrella. Afterwards, I saw this foreigner coming back with MY umbrella. When I realized that he was holding my umbrella, I was very angry. So I asked him, “Why did you take my umbrella? Didn’t you know that it was raining outside? How can someone be so impolite?”

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What was the color of the umbrella that your brought on that day? Were there any features? 

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The color was blue. It was probably a dark blue umbrella.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Show exhibit number one. Please look at page number five. Is the umbrella on this picture yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s the one.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is a very regular umbrella. It’s the kind of umbrella that you can buy at any 7-11 convenience store. How can you be so sure that it’s your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	It’s true that I bought my umbrella in 7-11. However, my umbrella has some damage in the button area. I told the police about this feature when I was filing for this case. And the umbrella that the foreigner put back to the rack has the same features. Therefore, I can be sure that it’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So, can you forgive him after he showed regrets? Because, at the end of the day, it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it’s JUST an umbrella? This is a question of basic morals. What if he didn’t bring back the umbrella that I had to go home in the rain? I do not want to forgive him AT ALL!

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I see. The court will subpoena the three witnesses that the accused mentioned. The next proceeding is set at 3 PM, on June 25th, 2018. The three witnesses and the accused should all be here on that day. The accused, is this date okay with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The accuser, you can choose to be here or not for the next proceeding. Basically, we’ll be asking question to the three witnesses that the accused mentioned. You can be here if you want. Do you understand?

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	That won’t be necessary. I do not want to take another day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. This is the end of today’s proceeding. Please leave after you sign the court script.

zh-TW	那天我跟我的同學是到鶯歌博物館鶯歌陶瓷博物館去參加一場展覽，當展覽看完之後，其中一位同學說肚子有點餓了，所以我們就打算去找一些東西吃，或許找一些東西當作晚餐。當我要走出鶯歌陶瓷博物館時，外面下雨了，我沒有帶我的傘，所以我就想說要從我朋友那邊借一支。因為我長得比較強壯一點，所以我就想說要從我的朋友艾登那邊借一支傘，因為他的身形跟我比較相似。所以我就從架上拿出拿走了一把傘，然後跟我的兩位朋友跟教授一起去吃午一起去買晚餐，當我們回來時，我就看到陳小姐在那邊對者我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?

zh-TW	那天我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展，我們看完展後，我們都覺得很餓，就決定出去買些食物。當我要離開博物館時，我發現外面正在下雨，而我並沒有帶傘，於是我就想跟我的一位同學借傘。因為我的個子比較高，身型較大，我就跟我的朋友亞當借傘，他的身形跟我很像。之後我就從傘架拿一支傘，和我的教授以及其他同學去買些麵包。當我們回來時，陳小姐看到我拿她的傘就開始對我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	So the umbrella you borrowed was belonged to your classmate Adam?

zh-TW	有的。當我從博物館出來時，我的教授和其他兩位同學都在。我的教授當時想要借我她的傘，但因為她的傘有點小，而我不想要她被淋濕，就沒有跟她借。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?

zh-TW	我當時試著要還陳小姐她的傘，但她不接受。我試著跟她道歉，她也不聽。也許我的教授和朋友們可以佐證我今天講的話都是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Now I’m going to ask Miss Chen what happened that day. Miss Chen could you please describe what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	That day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack. However, when I came out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staffs of the museum to help me find the umbrella. Then, I saw this foreigner took my umbrella. I was angry, so I asked he why did he take my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How could he do that to me?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What was the color of the umbrella you brought that day? Was there any characteristic?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day was blue. Dark blue, maybe.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now I’m going to show the picture on page 5 of the investigatory file. Is the umbrella in the picture belongs to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is just the ordinary one, the one you can buy from 7-11. How can you be so sure that it is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought it from 7-11. However, the button part was a little broken, and the umbrella can’t be closed. When I reported the case to the police, I mentioned this point. The one that the foreigner took had the same feature, so I was sure that it was mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Would you like to forgive the other party if he is regretful and willing to apologize? After all, it is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it is just an umbrella? This is an issue of morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, I would have got wet when I went home. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. Then, we will subpoena the three witnesses that were mentioned before. We will ask them to come to the court to explain what happened that day. The next court date will be set at 3 pm June 25th 2018. The defendant, is the time okay for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The accuser, Miss Chen, the next court date you can choose to come or not to come. We will ask some questions to the defendant’s classmates and professor.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I will have to take another day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. The court is rest. Please sign the scrip before you leave.

zh-TW	今為偷竊案件偵字1425號偵查程序
en-US	Today we are here for the investigatory procedure of theft case, case number 2826.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The incident happened on May 27th, 2018. And the accused, Paul Anderson is accused of taking away an umbrella of the accuser Chen Xiaoqian. Because the accused didn’t inform the accuser that he took the umbrella, when he returned the umbrella, he was caught. Therefore the accuser decided to file a lawsuit against him. And the location was at Yingge Ceramics Museum. Today’s procedure is to find the reason of this case and let the prosecutor know what happened about the incident. Do you fully understand? Later I will ask the accuser what happened about the incident to fully understand this case. Do both parties understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	The accused, where were you at 4:15pm on May 27th, 2018?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我当时在莺歌陶瓷博物馆。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time did you see the accuser Miss Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，当我把雨伞还回去的时候，陈小姐在那里。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她当时对着我大叫，说我偷了她的伞，我于是向她解释我可能是拿错了伞，并没有偷。我当时也试图给它道歉，但她并不接受。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和同学去了莺歌陶瓷博物馆去看一个展览，看完展品之后，有同学说很饿想去吃东西，于是我们想去找一个吃东西的地方，和找个地方吃晚饭。当我离开博物馆之后，我看到下雨了，但是我并没有带伞，于是我就想说借同学的伞。因为我身材高大，所以我想借亚当的雨伞，因为他身材和我差不多。我从架子上拿了一把雨伞，然后就给教授和同学买面包，当我回来的时候，就发现陈小姐对我大喊大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed is from your classmate Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我当时觉得自己拿的是亚当的雨伞，我并没有被想要偷任何人的雨伞。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you borrowed that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只记得雨伞的颜色。它是蓝色的，然后并不是崭新的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象当中，那个伞是蓝色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone verify what your said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，当我离开博物馆的时候，我和一个教授和两个同学一起。教授当时甚至要借给我她自己的伞。因为她的伞太小了，我不想身上淋湿，所以没要她的伞，当时两个同学也在那里。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Do you mean that all three of them can be present at the court and verify what you said, am I right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想应该是这样。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence you want the police to help investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我试图把伞归还给陈小姐，但她不要，我也试图给她道歉，但她也不接受，也许我的教授和同学能证实我说的是真的吧。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK, let me ask you a few questions on what happened about the incident?Miss Chen, can you tell us what happened at that time on this incident?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	It was raining when I was going to the Yingge Ceramics Museum. And I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I was about to leave the museum, the umbrella was gone. I asked the staff from the museum to help me find the umbrella and I found that this foreigner returned the umbrella. I was quite angry the umbrella he returned was exactly the one that I have. I asked him why did he take my umbrella. How could he be so ethically irresponsible?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Miss Chen, what’s the color of your umbrella? Are there any characteristics of your umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took that day was blue, dark blue I guess.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Exhibit evidence one, page five. Does the umbrella on the photo belongs to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it belongs to me.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on the photo was quite ordinary that can even be bought everywhere like 711. How can you be so sure that the umbrella on the photo is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	It is indeed bought at a 711-convenience store. But my umbrella has some problems with its buttons and it can’t be fixed. I explained to the police about this matter and the umbrella the foreigner returned on the rack also has problems with its buttons. So I think it’s exactly the same umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Would you forgive him after he apologizes to you and show his regrets? After all it’s only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by just an umbrella. It’s a matter about moral qualities. If he did not return my umbrella, I would go in the rain and go home. I would not forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Ok, I understand. This court will subpoena three witnesses to the court. And the next proceeding will be at 3pm, June 25th, 2018. And the three witnesses shall be at the court for the proceeding. Are you ok with this date? 

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, for the next proceeding, you can either come or not because the next proceeding is mainly to ask questions to the professors and students. It’s okay for you to come to the court.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I will not be present at the next proceeding because I have to ask for a leave permit.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	Ok, I understand. This court is dismissed. Please sign the court script and then leave.

zh-TW	(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?
en-US	On the page five, please check the picture. Is it the cap that you took?

en-US	Yes, it is that cap.
zh-TW	喔，是的，是這頂。

zh-TW	然後呢? 發生了什麼事? 
en-US	Then? What happened?

en-US	Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
zh-TW	因為旁邊沒有人，所以我就拿了。

zh-TW	你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?
en-US	So you did take that cap?

en-US	Yes, I did.
zh-TW	是的，我拿的。

zh-TW	你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?
en-US	So don't you know that this cap belongs to someone else that you cannot take it!

en-US	I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
zh-TW	我很抱歉我拿走了這頂帽子，我想還回去，但沒有辦法，我今天把這頂帽子帶來了。

zh-TW	所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎? 
en-US	So I want to make sure the whole process again.So that they said it happened in a parking lot, and there is no one around, so you took that cap, right? 

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened.
zh-TW	是的，這就是事情的經過。

zh-TW	因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?
en-US	So the… the… has raised the case. Do you want to apologize?

en-US	I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me.

zh-TW	Abus Gashion先生，你102年09月15日在桃園中正國際機場停車場，拿了機車車牌KB405上的一頂男用帽子，之後經受害者報案、警方調閱停車場的監視器紀錄，經身分確認後，了解該行為是你所為。由於該行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，又經受害者提出告訴，你涉嫌犯竊盜罪。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎?
en-US	So, you had taken the helmet at the parking lot in Taoyuan International Airport. And the helmet is belong… belongs to the motorcycle which has the number is(of?) KB485.(記錯了) You did that behavior on September, 15th. And the victim went to the police. The police checked the recording and think that you had did that. Without the permission and the victim had gone to the police, so you had violent(violated) the theft. Today what we’re doing is want to know what had happened that day. Please answer the question(s) below to let me know the… what’s happening that day.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	那請問102年9月15日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
en-US	So where were you at four fifteen on September 15th?

en-US	I was at CKS International Airport.
zh-TW	我當時在桃園機場。

zh-TW	你當時去機場做什麼呢??
en-US	Why did you go to the airport?

en-US	I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
zh-TW	我去那邊接來台灣旅遊的朋友。

zh-TW	所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
en-US	So you said that you had…you just go there to pick up a friend at the terminal.

en-US	Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.
zh-TW	對，我是搭客運去那裡的，但是我早到了，所以我在那邊等了一下我朋友。

zh-TW	那為什麼後來會發生你拿原告帽子這件事呢?
en-US	So why did the thing happen (like) that you took other’s helmet?

en-US	I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.
zh-TW	因為我朋友的班機延誤了，然後當時為了打發時間所以我就到處繞繞來殺時間。

zh-TW	你後來去了哪裡呢?
en-US	So where did you go later?

en-US	I went to the parking lot for motorcycles.
zh-TW	我去了摩托車的停車場。

zh-TW	然後發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	So… what happened?

en-US	I saw a cap left on one motorcycle.
zh-TW	我看到有一頂帽子遺落在機車座椅上。

zh-TW	(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?
en-US	Please see the picture five. Is that cap actually this hat?

en-US	Yes, it is that cap.
zh-TW	對，就是那頂帽子。

zh-TW	然後呢? 發生了什麼事? 
en-US	So what happened later?

en-US	Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
zh-TW	因為當時四下無人，所以我就把帽子拿走了。

zh-TW	你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?
en-US	Did you say that you just took away other’s hat?

en-US	Yes, I did.
zh-TW	對，是我做的。

zh-TW	你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?
en-US	Don’t you know that cap belong(s) to other? You can’t do that.

en-US	I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
zh-TW	 我很抱歉我所做過的行為，但是我有想要把帽子還給當事人，就像我今天有把帽子帶來。

zh-TW	所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎? 
en-US	So let me confirm again. At that day, you took this cap at motorcycle parking lot because there is no one seeing. So you just took it, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened.
zh-TW	對，這就是事情發生的經過。

zh-TW	因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?
en-US	 Now the victim had accused you, so do you have the will to solve this problem?

en-US	I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me. 
zh-TW	我有嘗試向物主道歉但是他不接受。

zh-TW	沒關係，如果你有意願，我們會幫你跟原告進行和解，那先訂103年2月27日早上9點鐘進行調解，你可以到庭嗎? 如果一切順利，可能就會以金錢賠償的方式，結束這個案子，你明白嗎?
en-US	 Don’t mind. If you want to apologize to the victim, we will help you. So we would like to have you to have a meeting with him at nine o’clock on February 27th, 2014. If everything goes well, this case may end up with some money payment. Do you understand?

en-US	I understand and I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我了解了。我一定會出席的。

zh-TW	好，那我們會通知原告，如果日期不能配合，我們會再通知你，可以嗎? 如果沒有問題，就請你那天準時到本棟四樓的調解室，明白嗎?
en-US	So we will let the victim know the date. And if he cannot show up, we would let you know. Is this okay? No other questions, please show up (on) that day at fourth floor. Do you understand?

en-US	Thank you. I will be there on time.
zh-TW	是的，謝謝。我了解了，我會準時出席的。

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today we are here for the child rearing case between Ferry Johnson and Tasi-yun Shi. Can I ask both sides: do you hire lawyers?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I have a lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有律師。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today I want to know the two sides’positions with the child rearing case and I would know why each of you think you are the better side to keep this child. Please state the details especially at this point. Besides, I know this case also has divorce ongoing. So I hope the case of verbal attack does not happen.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	I have few questions for the plaintiff. Why do you want to get the child rearing right for the kid? As I know, in Taiwan, you don’t have a full-time job and you are a foreigner. Why do you think you are more capable in the case of child rearing?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望法院能判給我全部的撫養權，我有兩個原因。第一，我的妻子沒有再與我們同住了，我想要看著我的女兒長大。再者，我聽說我的太太與其他男人同居，如果這是真，我很疑惑他是否能給我們的女兒完整的照顧，因此我希望獲得撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	so do you mean because your wife is now going to divorce with you and at the same time she’living with another man and you also suspected her of living with another man. Is it because of this situation so you don’t want to leave your daughter to her, is that right?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對，這些是我主要的顧慮。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	In addition, according to your financial status, if you get the sole custody, what would you do to take care of this child?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在的確是們有全職的工作，但是我有兼職許多工作所以我有固定的收入，我想這些收入應該足以支撐我和女兒的生活。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned now you have several part time jobs. Because these are all part time jobs, can you estimate around how much income you will get every month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我有至少4-5件兼職工作，所以平均一個月我可以賺一萬五千元，有時候如果有接到新的計畫，可能有機會賺更多。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	I have another question, is it possible that when you get the sole custody of your child, you are going to bring your child back to Canada. I will as this question is because even you get the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you take your daughter back to Canada, this will be seen as you cut the tie of your daughter with the mother. To this argument, what’s your plea?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了，我有居留證而且我也喜歡這裡，目前我對在台灣的生活很滿意，特別是我希望我的女兒可以看到他的父母。我要說的是目前我和我太太正在打離婚官司，我們並不希望彼此切斷與女兒的聯繫。在我們離婚官司進行中，我定期會繼我們女兒的照面給太太看，我甚至還安排時間讓我們三個有時兼聚一聚。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	so do you mean that in the recent future, you have no plan to go back to Canada, is that right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	不，我有可能會回加拿大因為我的母親年紀大了又生病，但即使我回去也不會長久待在那，我甚至不會考慮把女兒帶在身邊。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Now I’m going to ask free questions to the defendant. Currently you are not living your husband any more?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, you have been separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the case of divorcing?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	I guess I filed it two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So you mean far before you filed the case, you hadn’t lived together already.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	What is your living circumstances right now? I mean, who do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son in the first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Oh, you mean your first marriage? So what is your marriage with Ferry Johnson right now?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He’s my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	In the child rearing right that you are fighting for right now is with your second husband and it’s a daughter?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and how old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, was your daughter with you or him?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I moved out my daughter was only two months old so she stayed with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	where is the child right now?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	my daughter is at my husband’s place.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	do you have any agreement between you two? Why did the daughter stay with you in the first place and then move to your husband’s place?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place I just moved out is smaller and my husband’s bigger. In terms of the environment, my husband’s place is better so I leave the daughter to him.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstances don’t change, I mean your living situations, your daughter still better stays at your husband’s place? Why do you want to win the child rearing right?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	It took me ten months to get the child. I couldn’t stand that I cannot see her any more. And my husband is a Canadian and he doesn’t have a full-time job. He may go back to Canada any time. Thus, it means I cannot see my daughter any more. That’s why I’m asking the custody of my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	In terms of your financial status, can you elaborate how would you raise your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	We still have the divorcing case going. I hope after the case of divorce I can live where my husband’s living now, the house. Thus in terms of environment, the house is better for my daughter. As to my financial status, I’ve offered the court a list of my asset. Besides, I have a regular job. I earn at least 40000 a month. I think I have the right to rear my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	So what’s the process going of your divorcing case? Do you know around what time the case will be settled?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not quite sure. This Friday we will go to the court again. I will talk to the judge of the case that we hope to see the result faster.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Let’s say we will arrange social workers to visit both the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s houses and we will take into account the interactions of both sides with the child. The court will consider the report after the visit and make the best decision for the daughter. However, before that, will both sides consider the shared custody? The sahred custody means that the daughter will stay sometimes at the mother’s place and sometimes at father’s place.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	對我個人而言我是不希望共同撫養權，因為我的女兒還太小，他才八個月大，我不希望她在我與太太之間流轉。對於這樣年紀小的孩子來說，我覺得這樣太累，一下子搬到母親的地方、一下子換到我的地方。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	At this point, I agree with my husband. The daughter is too little. She shouldn’t and it’s not suitable in this case.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	So we all arrange the visit of social workers first. After we see the report, we will arrange the next court day to keep the right for both parties to state their rights.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我同意社工人員的探訪。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I don’t have any question here. Thank you.

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today I am here… Today this preparing procedure is for court to understand……and I also want to know why you….both of you think that you have the ability to raise the child. Please elaborate this point.Beside,I….beside I also know you have another case for divorce. So I hope there is no verbal attack in this court . Do you understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	yes,i do

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	First, let me ask some questions.So plaintiff , why do you want to get the custody right?as i know, you don’t have a job in taiwan. and you are also a foreigner. So for the child rearing case, why do you think you have ability to raise your child?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望可以把所有撫養權都判給我，因為我很關心他。第一我老婆已經不再跟我們一起住了，我想要看著我的女兒長大，而且我還聽說我的老婆跟別的男人同居，如果真的是這樣的話我懷疑我老婆沒有能力養活這孩子，所以我要爭取全部的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	what you mean is because your wife have divorce case with you, so she is not live with you,right? and you doubt that she lives with other man. it is because of this situation, you don’t want to give your children to her.

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對，這就是我所關心的。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Other than that, for your financial statement,how do you raise your daughter?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在的確沒有全職的工作。但是我有幾份打工，應該可以提供我所有需要。我想這些收入足以養我和我的女兒。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. since all of them are part-time job, can you estimate your regular income per month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我個人大概有四到五個兼職工作。全部加起來的話，一個月大概可以提供五萬塊的收入。有時候如果我有接到新案子的話，每個月的收入都會更加增加。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	So other than salary, will you bring your daughter to Canada after you got the custody, and you will never come back? I mention this point is that even if you got the sole custody, your wife still have visitation right. If you take your daughter back to Canada, it means that you cut the tie with your daughter and her mother. So what do you think?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了。我已經有居留證，而且我很喜歡這個地方。目前還沒有任何打算離開台灣的計畫。而且我也覺得我的女兒也希望可以見到父母。我想說的是即使我現在在和我老婆打離婚官司，我也沒有打算切斷她和女兒之間的聯繫。在我們打離婚官司的同時，我也常常寄我們女兒的照片給她。我甚至和她達成協議，有時候可以大家一起出來聚聚。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you are not going back to Canada recently, right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	沒有...如果我要回加拿大的話是因為我媽媽又老又生病了。然而，就算我回去加拿大了，我也不會在那裡久留。我也不會考慮把我的女兒帶回去加拿大。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	And now i am going to ask your wife some question.You are not live with your husband now, right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes,we have already separate for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	So when do you seek for divorce?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So you mean that far before…you ….seek divorce, you have already separate for some time.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	Can you tell me your living standard….i mean…who lives with you?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my second son…

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? so ……..

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So the child rearing case we dicuss here is your daughter?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and my daughter is about eight month.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	After you leave your house, your daughter stay with you or hisband.

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When i leave my husband, since my daughter is still small, so the daughter….

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	So where is the child?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now my daughter is with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	 Is there any agreement with you and your hisband?first, your daughter live with you, and now she live with your husband, why?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	After I move out, the  place where we were live is a little bit smaller than my husband’s house. So I think the environment is better for the children, so I give my daughter to my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So if objective condition is not change, you still don’t have….better…so why do you want to get custody of your daughter.

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is my daughter, I cannot bear not to see her in the future. Beside, my husband is canadian, and he don’t have a regular job, and he may lost her job and go back to Canada. in that case, I will never see my daughter.That’ why I want the custody of my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Can you elaborate how do you raise your daughter.

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Since we are still in divorce case. as for the environment, it’s fit for my daughter. as for my finical statement, I have already provide the asset list for the courts other than that I have a regular job, it’s about forty thousand a month.So I think I have ability to take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	May I ask about your divorce case?Do you know when will the result revil?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure. We have another court this week. I want to ask the judge, for the divorce case, I hope the verdict will come out soon.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Ok now we will arrange social workers for the both side. And the evaluation will be about how you take care of your daughter. We will refer the the report and decide what is better for your daughter. and before that,will you both side consider share the custody?As for the share custody, it’s mean that the daughter live with after and mother for sometime.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人來說，我不太喜歡這個提議，因為我的女兒還太小，他也只有八個月大而已。我不想要讓他經歷我跟我老婆這段破碎的關係。對於年紀這麼小的女兒來說，他應該會覺得突然跟爸爸或是媽媽住是一件很奇怪的事情。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	I agree my husband at this point. my daughter is too small, she is not okay for this kind of resolution.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Okay, so we arrange the social worker for evaluation first.After they finish report,we will arrange the court for another day to let both party has chance to elaborate their right.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我沒有問題

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	i am fine, too.

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有請律師

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	In the preparatory procedure today, we want to know your opinions about child rearing. And I also want to know why both of you think you are more suitable for the child. Please elaborate this detail. Also, I know you are dealing with the divorcing case, so I hope both of you won’t have verbal attack, okay?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Now I am going to ask the plaintiff some questions. Plaintiff, why do you fight for the custody of your child? As I know, you don’t have a full time job now, in Taiwan. And also you are a foreigner. Why do you think you are suitable for your child?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望可以把小孩全權判給我有兩個原因 首先我老婆已經不跟我們住在一起了 我想要看著我的小孩長大 而且我聽說我老婆現在跟別的男人住在一起 如果真的是這樣的話 我很懷疑他能不能好好的養育我的小孩 因此我希望有全部的撫養權

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean you and your wife is going a divorcing case, but she no longer lives with you? And you think she lives with another man? Is that the reason why you don’t want her to take care of the child, is that right?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對阿 這是我主要的考量

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	As for your financial status, I mean if you get the custody, what would you do?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在是真的沒有一份全職的工作啦 可是我有很幾份兼職的工作讓我也有正常的收入  我相信我的收入足夠來養我跟我的小孩

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have many part time jobs. They are all part time jobs, so can you make sure how much money can you make per month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均有四到五份兼職工作 平均來說 我一個月有五萬塊 有時候如果有新case的話可能還會賺更多錢

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	And I also want to know if you get the custody of your child, will you go back to Canada and no longer come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask this question is that even you get the custody; your wife still had the visitation right. If you take your child back to your country, it means that you cut the tie between them. What’s your opinion about this?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣住五年了 我有居留證而且我也喜歡這個地方 目前我沒有離開台灣的計畫 而且我認為我女兒有見到父母雙方的權利 我想強調的是 雖然我跟我太太正在辦離婚 可是我完全沒有要切斷他跟我女兒的關係 在打離婚官司的過程中 我也都會固定傳女兒照片給我老婆 我還安排出去的機會讓她跟女兒有相處的時間

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean you don’t have the plain to go back to your country in a short time?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	沒有我可能會回加拿大 因為我媽已經老了而且在生病 可是就算我回去也不會待很久 我甚至不會考慮要帶著女兒一起回去

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Okay now I want to ask you some question. So you don’t live with your husband now, right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have lived apart for 6 months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the case of divorce?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	That is, long before you sued for divorce, you don’t lived together.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So who do you live with now?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son from my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? so you and the plaintiff’s marriage is…?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So the custody we are saying now, is your second child, your daughter, right?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	So how old are your son and daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My sun is seven years old now, and my daughter is 8 months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, your daughter lived with you or him?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I moved out, our daughter was only two months old. She still needed lot of cares, so she lived with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Then, presently, who does she live with?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now she lives with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter originally lived you, but now with him?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place I live now is smaller, and the original house I lived with my husband is bigger. Considering about the environment, I think the old house is better for my daughter, so I took her back to live with my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So considering about the objective circumstance, I mean the space of your house, it’s still worse for her, isn’t it? Then why would you want the custody of your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	Come on, I borne her! How would you think I don’t want to see her in the future? Also my husband is a Canadian, and his job is Taiwan is not stable so he may go back to Canada anytime. In that case, doesn’t that mean I can see my daughter anymore? So I want to have the custody of my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Can you tell me how would bring up your child? With your financial status.

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	So far, we are still dealing with the divorcing case. I want to fight for the right to live in the house which my husband lives now, after our divorce. So consider about the environmental issue, the house will suit my daughter a lot. As for my financial status, I have given the court an asset list. Also, I have a regular income; it’s about 40000 per month. So I think I have the ability to take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	So how your divorcing case is goes now? Do you know when will the court’s decision come out?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not very sure about that. We will go to the court this Friday. I will ask the judge of our divorcing case to make the decision as soon.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Okay, then I will sent the social to do to visit both of your houses. And make an evaluation of how you get along with your daughter. And I will take their report into consideration to decide what’s best for the child. Before that, I want to ask both of you, would you consider about sharing shared custody of your daughter? The shared custody goes like that, your daughter will live with you sometime, and the other time lives with your husband.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人不支持這個 因為我女兒還在小了 他只有八個月大耶 我不想要她一直在我跟我老婆之間一直改變環境 對一個這麼小的小孩來說 他會混淆吧 如果他真得要這樣跟我住一段時間又跟她住一段時間

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	I agree with my husband in this. She is too small, it shouldn’t to this way.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Okay, then, I will arrange the social worker to your houses first. After the make the report, we will set the court date to let both of you have a chance to make a statement, is that okay with you?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	好啊 社工要來我可以

zh-TW	台北市士林區忠誠路3段414號5樓
en-US	Fl. 5, No. 414, Sec. 3, Chung Cheng Rd., Shilin Dist., Taipei City.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparation procedure of custody case for Ferry Johnson and Tsai-yun Shih. Do both parties have the lawyer?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes I have the lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有請律師

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	In today’s procedure, I want to know what the idea of both parties in custody is. I also want know why both of you think that you are suitable for getting the custody. Please focus on it as your statement. Besides, you are also having the divorce case. So I want both of you would not have verbal attack to each other.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	At first I will ask some questions to plaintiff. Why you want to get the custody of your child? As I know, you don’t have the full-time job in Taipei. Also, you are a foreigner. In the case of custody, why you strive for rearing your child?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我之所以希望能得到全部的撫養權有兩個原因。首先，我老婆不再與我們住在一起了，我希望能看著我小孩長大。再來，我聽說我老婆現在跟別的男人住在一起，如果真的是那樣的話，我很懷疑我女兒能得到全然的照顧。因此我希望擁有全部的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean you are no longer live together though you are under the case of divorce? Also, you doubt that she is living together with another man. I that circumstances, you don’t want to share the custody with your wife?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的，這是我主要考慮的一些因素。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Otherwise, concerning your financial status, if you get the custody of your daughter, how would you raise your child?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	雖然我現在沒有正職工作是真的，但是我有好幾份兼職工作讓我有固定的收入。我相信這足夠讓我和我女兒過活。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Can you promise that you have regular income?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均會有四到五個兼職，總共來說我大概會有五萬的收入。有時如果有另外的案子我可以有更多的收入。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	I have a further question, is that possible to bring your child to Canada and no more back to Taiwan after you get the custody? The reason why I ask so because even you get sole custody, your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring your child back to Canada, you are separating your wife and child. What’s your idea to this point?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年，我有居留證，而且我也愛這個地方。目前我沒有要離開台灣。另外我也覺得我的女兒有權利可以看到她的爸爸媽媽。雖然我和我老婆正在打離婚官司，我絕對沒有意圖想阻止我女兒與老婆之間的聯繫。在我跟我老婆打離婚官司的過程中，我仍會定期傳女兒的照片給她。我也有鼓勵她多與我們相處。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So recently you don’t plan to back to Canada?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	我有可能會回去加拿大因為我媽媽年老且生病。但就算我回去我也不會待很久。我甚至不會想帶我女兒一起回加拿大。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Okay I have some question to ask the opposite position. Aren’t you living with your husband?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	No, we haven’t lived together for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the divorce suit?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	It might be two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So you didn’t live together before you file the lawsuit, right?.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So what’s your living situation, I mean, who do you live together with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son of my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	The first marriage? What time is the marriage with plaintiff?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is the second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	null

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son? And how old is your daughter.

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out the house, who was your daughter with?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	Because my daughter was only two months old when I was moving out. She needed my care so she was with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Where is daughter with?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	My daughter is with my husband now.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter was first with you and now she is with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place where I am living is smaller than the house when I lived with my husband. I think, environmentally, it is good for my daughter to live with my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So in the objective circumstances, if it isn’t changed, it isn’t good for your daughter to live with you. Why you still want the custody of your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I had ten months pregnant to give birth to her. She is my child. And my husband is a Canadian, also he doesn’t have the full-time job, he might go back to Canada any time. If so, I would not see my daughter any more. So I want to be granted with the custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	To your financial status, can you clarify how you raise your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	We are under the case of divorce. I hope that I can get the right to live in the house which my husband is living in after divorcing. That house is good for my daughter to grow. Also I provide a asset list to the court to make clear my financial status. In addition, I have full-time job and my wage a month is up to forty thousands. I think I capable to take care and raise my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	How’s going with your divorce case? Do you know when is the court’s decision? Or the maybe-date?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not sure. We will have the court date this Friday. I want to inform the judge of the divorce case…………

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Okay, I will arrange the social worker to visit both of you. And make evaluations separately between both of you and your daughter. It will be the reference to the court decision of the custody. Before that, will you want to share the custody? To the definition of shared custody, it means, in a period of time, the child is with father, then, in another period of time, the child is with mother.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	個人來說，我沒有很喜歡這個主意，我女兒還太小。她才八個月大，我不想要她年紀那麼小就經歷那麼多變動。對這麼小的小孩而言，一下跟爸爸住一下跟媽媽住可能會讓她覺得困惑。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	In that point, I agree with my husband. It’s too young to my daughter.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Okay I get it. I will arrange the visit of social worker. After the evaluation, we will arrange another court date to make opportunities that both parties can state. Is that okay with you?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	好的我對社工人員的探訪沒有意見。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	It’s fine with me, thank you.

en-US	Today’s purpose is to realize the position of you two about child rearing. And I hope that I can know that why do you to all think that yourself are suitable to raise this child. please elaborate this point in detail. In addition, I know that you are also in the divorce procedure, so I hope that both of you do not have any verbal attack to  each other in today’s court, it that ok with both of you?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Please tell me that why you want to fight for the custody? I know that you don’t have a full time job in Taiwan, and you are also a foreigner. As for fighting for child rearing , why do you think that you are suitable for ? 

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望我能獲得我女兒全部的撫養權。首先,我老婆早就不跟我們一起住了。我想陪著我女兒長大。再者，我早就聽聞我老婆已經跟另外一個男生住在一起了。如果這是真的，我非常懷疑我老婆是不是能給我女兒一個最完善的照顧。因此，我希望我可以獲得全部的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean that although you are in divorce procedure, your wife hasn’t lived with you. Moreover, you also suspect that your wife has already lived with another guy? In this situation, you don’t want to let your wife take care of your child, right?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的,這些是我的疑慮

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	besides, as for your personal financial status, how do you take your daughter?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	的確，我現在是沒有全職工作。但是我有很多份兼職工作可以有穩定的收入。我相信這些收入夠我可以照顧我自己以及我女兒。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	Yu just mentioned that you have several part time jobs so far。Because they are all part time jobs, can you estimate that how much fixed income do you earn each month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均有四到五份兼職工作。總共大概每個月可賺五萬塊。有時候，如果我有接到新的案件，就可以賺到更多錢。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	I want to ask you another question, which is that will you bring your daughter back to Canada and never come back after you are granted with sole custody. The reason why I ask you this question is that even if you are granted with sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your kid back to Canada, which means that you separate your daughter and wife. What’s your opinion about this?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待五年了。我有居留證號碼，而且我也喜歡這個地方。目前我沒有打算離開台灣。特別是我覺得我女兒應該要有權利可以看到她麼爸媽。我意思是，雖然我跟我老婆正在打離婚官司，我也沒有意思要打斷他們兩個之間的聯繫。甚至在官司期間，我固定會寄女兒的照片給我老婆。我甚至都會安排外出活動，鼓勵他多花時間跟我跟我女兒在一起。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	you mean that you don’t have intention of going back to your hometown recently, right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	對。我可能會回去是因為我媽媽老了也生病了。即使我回家加拿大，我也不會待很久。我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒一起去。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	now I am going to ask the other party that do you live with your husband now?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	yes, we have been separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	when do you …….

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	about two months ago

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	that is to say, you have been separated before you sue for divorce?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	yes

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	what’s your ………., I mean, who do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son …………

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? What the …….

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	he is my second husband

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	so whom you are fighting for child rearing is …………………..

zh-TW	對。
en-US	yes

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	how old is your son? And how old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	my son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight month old

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	so when you move out, whom does your daughter lives with ,you or your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	when I move out, my daughter is only two month old, she still needs me, so she lived with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	where is your daughter now?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	she lives with my husband now.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Do you have any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter lived with you before and now she lives with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	where I move in is smaller than that which my husband lived. As far as environment is concerned, it’s better for child, so I let my daughter live with my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	if there is ………., your environment condition is not good for your daughter, right? Why do you still want to fight for child rearing?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	………, how can I bear that I cannot see her anymore? My husband is Canadian, he doesn’t have steady job in Taiwan, he may go back to Canada anytime. In that way, I will no longer see my daughter. So , I hope I can fight for child rearing.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	as for your financial status, can you further elaborate that how do you afford your daughter’s arising expenditure?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	we are still in divorce procedure, so I hope that I can live in the house where my husband is living in. as for the environment, that would be suitable for my daughter. As for my personal financial status, I have provided the court with an asset list. Besides that, I have a regular income which is at least 40000 dollars. I think that I am able to raise my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	……… when does your sentence will make. That is to say,……

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure. We will attend the court on Friday. I hope that I can express my opinion of making the sentence done.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	alright, the court will arrange social worker to pay a visit to both of you and make a evaluation focus on how do you get along with your daughter. The court will decide which arrangement is better for child depends on their reports. Before that, I would like to ask you that will both of you consider keeping shared custody which means your child will live with father for some time and live with mother for another time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人是不喜歡這樣的安排，因為我女兒還太小。他只有8個月大。我不想要他跟著我們的決定兩地奔波。對於一個這麼小的小孩，這些對他來說實在是太困惑了，一下要跟媽媽住，一下又要跟爸爸住。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	as for this, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small; she should not, and is not suitable for this kind of arrangement of shared custody

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	since that, we will arrange social worker to visit you first. After they finishing their reports, we will arrange the court date and …….

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我也同意社工探訪.

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today, we are here for the preparation procedure of Mr. Johnson and Miss. Shih, their child rearing case. Do both parties have lawyers?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I have my lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有請律師。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today, the judge mainly wants to know the idea of both parties on the child rearing case. I also want to know the reasons why do you think you are suitable to raise the children. Please answer the question to me. Also, I know you are dealing with the divorce case. Therefore, I don’t want to see any situation of verbal attack, do you understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	First, I want to ask few questions for the plaintiff. Why do you want to get the rearing right of your children. In my understandings, you don’t have the full-time job in Taiwan. And you are a foreigner. Why do you think that you are more suitable for raising your children?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望我可以得到我子女全部的扶養權，就以下這幾點。首先，我妻子已經沒有再跟我們住在一起了，我希望我可以陪伴著我孩子成長。此外，我還知道我太太跟其他男人住在一起，如果真是如此，我很懷疑她是否真能給我們的孩子最好的照顧。因此，我希望可以得到全部的扶養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that your wife is no longer live with you even if she is still under the divorcing case? Moreover, you doubt that she is living with another man now? It is because under such circumstance that you do not want her to take care of your child?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對，這是我主要這樣做的原因。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Regarding with your financial status, if you get the right to raise your daughter, how do you deal with your financial status? How do you have the money to take care of your daughter?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在沒有所謂正職的工作是事實啦，但是我現在也有一些打工啊，都可以帶給我固定的收入。我相信那些收入已經足夠讓我和我的女兒生活了。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because they are part-time jobs, can you calculate how much money that you are sure you can earn per month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我有四到五個打工的工作，平均來說。這大概可以讓我每個月賺五萬元左右吧。如果我有得到新的工作的話，也許這收入會更高。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Moreover, I want to know that if you have the right to raise children; will you take your child back to Canada and you will not come back ever again? I would ask this question is because even if you do get the right to raise your children, your wife may still have the visitation right for your child. If you take your child back to Canada, it will transform into the separation of the mother and the child. What your opinion about this?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣住五年了。我不只有居留證我也很喜歡這裡。到目前為止，我沒有想要離開台灣的打算。而且我也認同我女兒必須要見到父母雙方。而且我也想要重申，即使我和我太太目前還在打離婚官司，我卻沒有想阻止她們母女倆互相見面的權利。就在我們還在打離婚官司時，我不時會寄我女兒的照片給太太，我還邀請我太太一起和我和女兒出去玩。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you do not have the plan to go back to Canada recently? 

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	我也許會回加拿大，但那是因為我媽媽已經年紀很大而且又生病了。但是即使我回去了，我也不會長久待在那裡，我會讓我女兒一直和我待在一起。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Next, I want to ask few questions to the wife. Are you currently not living with your husband?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have already separately lived for about half a year.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the divorcing case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	so before you file the divorcing case, both of you did not live together anymore?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	What your living condition right now? I mean who did you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son from the first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? So ,which marriage is you with your current husband?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So, the case of rearing we are fighting now is for the daughter of your second marriage.

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, was your daughter with you or with your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	Since when I moved out, my daughter is just two months old, so she was with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Where is your daughter now?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	My daughter is with my husband now.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there any agreement between both parties? Why the daughter was with you first but the daughter was with your husband? 

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place I live after I moved out is smaller than the place my husband have. After consideration of the environment, I think the bigger house is more suitable for my daughter so I let my husband to take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstance does not change, I mean that you sill live in the smaller house, I don’t think it will be good for your child. Why do you want to fight for the rearing right?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is “my” daughter, I can’t imagine if I cannot see her anymore. Besides, my husband is a foreigner from Canada. He might go back to Canada because he even does not have a full-time job in Taiwan. In that case, I might not see my daughter ever again. As a result, I want to fight for the rearing right of my daughter. 

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	From your financial status, can you explain how do you plan to cover the money to take care of your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now, we are still on the divorce case. Now, I hope to get the court decision that my daughter and I can live in the house which my husband currently live. According to the environment, I think that house will be very suitable for the growth of my daughter. About my personal financial status, I have already given the court my asset lists. Moreover, I have the full-time job and the salary is about forty thousand NT dollars a month. I think I am able to take care of my daughter. 

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	Can you tell me what stage are your divorce case in? Do you know when or around what time the court decision will be given?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure. We will be here for the divorce case this Friday. I hope I may ask the judge of my divorce case to give the court decision as soon as possible.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	The court will hire the social workers to visit the houses of both parties. Also, according to the ways you dealing with your children, the social worker will evaluate it. The report will be examined by the court and we will make a decision on it. But before that, I want to ask both parties if you ever consider the shared custody? Shared custody is defined as follows, the child will firstly with the father and then he or she will latter with mother.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	就個人來講，我不太喜歡這種方式因為我女兒還很小，她才八個月大欸，我不想讓她經歷我和太太之間的變動，對這麼小的孩子來說，這會讓她很混亂，為什麼有時候和爸爸在一起，有時才能見媽媽呢?

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	To this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young, she should not and not suitable to go through the changes.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	I see, we will arrange the social worker to visit both parties. After they write down their report, we will arrange the next court time. Then we will let both parties to state their thoughts, is it clear?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	好，社工人員來探訪沒有問題。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I agree with it, thank you.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today’s preparation procedure is for Ferry Johnson and Ms. Shi for child rearing procedure.Do both parties have lawyers?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I have a lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有，我也是。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today I am here; my real purpose is to understand what’s your status in this child rearing. Also, I want to know why both of you think you have the right to rear this child. Please focus on this point clearly. Besides, I know you are under the procedure of the case of divorce. I hope you can avoid the verbal attacking, do you understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我瞭解。

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I do.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	So now, I will ask some question for plaintiff. Why you want to fight for the right for rearing your child? As I know, you don’t have the fall-time job in Taiwan now. You are a foreigner. Why do you think you are more proper than the defense that you can rear your child?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望能把我的孩子判給我是因為有一些考慮的。第一點，我的老婆沒有跟我們住在一起，我想在那看著我女兒長大。此外我聽說我老婆跟別人住。如果那是真的的話，我非常懷疑她是否有能力給們的女兒最好的照顧。因此我希望能得到全部的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean that your wife is under the procedure of a divorce case and she doesn’t live with you. Is that right? Also, you suspected that she is living with other man. Are those concerns that you think you don’t want your daughter to live with your wife?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	沒錯，那些是我主要的顧慮。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	As to your financial status, if you got the custody of your daughter, how can you raise her up?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在沒有全職工作是真的。但是我有幾分臨時工可以讓我有固定的收入，我認為我的收入足夠讓我和我的女兒生活。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because those jobs are part-time jobs, can you calculate how much can you earn each month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均大約有四到五個兼職。大約可以讓我賺到一萬五千元台幣每個月。有時候如果我有新的工作的話我會有新的收入。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	I have another question. If you have the custody of your daughter, will you bring her to Canada and never come back? The reason why I ask you that question is because although you have the custody of your daughter, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter to your country that means you will violate the right of your wife to visit your daughter. What’s your point about this case?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我在台灣已經待了有五年了，我有居留證而且我喜歡這個地方。到目前為止我並沒有任何計畫打算離開台灣。而且我確信我的女兒有權力見到她的父母。在這裡我要強調的是:雖然我和我的老婆正在打離婚官司，但是我絕對不會切斷她們的關係。在我們打離婚官司的程序中，我時常會寄我們女兒的照片給我老婆看。我也時常安排出去，我們三個一起出遊。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	You mean that recently you will not return to your mother country, is that right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	不，有可能因為我的媽媽已經年老了也生病了。即使我回去但我也不會待太久，我甚至不會考慮把我女兒一起帶去。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	so now, I will ask some question for other party. You don’t live with your husband, right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you have the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	Before you have the case, you didn’t live together.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	Who do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I bring my son of my first marriage together.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? What is your marriage time with the plaintiff?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So now, we are talking about the custody of the daughter which is you and your second husband have. 

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is eight-year old and my daughter is eight months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	After you leave your home, who live with your daughter?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	Because when I leave my home, my daughter was only two months so I worked her out in order to take care of her.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Where is your daughter now?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	My daughter is in my husband’s house.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Do you have any agreement that your daughter live with you first and later she lives with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	After I left my house, I live in a small house, but the original one is bigger. According to the environment, my husband’s house is better for my child.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstance that your house is not good enough, your daughter lives with your husband is a better choice, isn’t that right? Why you want to own the custody of your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I spent ten months to have my daughter. How can I endure that I cannot see her in the future? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian and he doesn’t have a full-time job. Also, he may leave Taiwan to Canada. As a result, I may not see my daughter in the future. So I hope I can fight for the custody of my daughter. 

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	How can you afford the expense for your daughter in your financial status?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now, we are still under the procedure of divorce case. I want to have the right to live in my husband’s house after the divorce. According to the environment, my husband’s house is suitable for my daughter to grow. As to my financial status, I have provided an asset list to the court. Besides, I have a regular full-time job. I earn about forty thousand NT dollars a month. I think I have the ability to take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	How’s your divorce case? When is the result be made about time?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure. This Friday we will have a court again. I will inform the judge in that court to make the decision earlier.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Ok, the court will have social workers to visit both of you, you and your husband. And make the evaluation to the situation that you and your husband’s accompanying your daughter. We will see the evaluation to decide the best choice for your daughter. So before the evaluation, I want to ask both of you that can you share the custody of your daughter? What is share custody is that your daughter will live with your husband for a period of time and later she will leave with you.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	基本上我不太贊同這個決議，因為我的女兒太小了，她才八個月大。我不想要她在我和我老婆之間換來換去。以我女兒現在的年紀來講，如果她一下子跟她媽媽住、一下子跟她爸爸住，這會讓她搞混。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	To that point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young, so it’s not proper and should not use that method.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Ok, now we arrange the schedule of social worker first. After they make a report, we will arrange the court day to give you the opportunity to state yourself, is that ok?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	OK 沒問題。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I am ok, too.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	  Today we are here for the procedure of child rearing rights for Ms. Tsai-Hung Shin and Mr. Ferry Johnson. Do both have the lawyer?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I did

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有請律師

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today, I want to understand the viewpoints of child rearing for both sides. The court will also figure out why both sides want the right to raise child. Please make more statements at this point, OK? In addition to this case, the court also knew that you were undergoing the divorce case. Both sides should avoid verbal attack on the court. Do you fully understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Explain why you urged to get child rearing right. So far you don’t have the full time job in Taiwan. Basically, you are the foreigner. In this case, why did you think you have the better right to get this?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望能把所有的撫養權判給我，因為有兩個原因，首先，我太太沒有和我們住在一起，我希望能看到我女兒在這邊長大。此外，我聽到消息說我老婆和別的男人住在一起，如果情況真的如此，那我懷疑我女兒能否得到最完善的照顧，因此，我希望能得到所有的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	In other words, your wife lived with another man when you had the divorce case. Besides, you also have the doubt she lives with another man. Under this circumstance, you are not willing to give the sole custody to her.

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的，這些就是我主要的考量

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Concerning about the financial status, if you get the custody, what will you do?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	的確，我現在沒有拿到一個全職工作，但是我有幾份兼職的工作，可以讓我保持一個穩定的收入，我相信這個金錢來源，足夠讓我養活我們

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mention you have several part-time jobs. Because those are part-time jobs, can you tell the amount conservatively?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我大概有四到五份兼職工作，全部總計每個月大概可以有五萬的收入，如果有接到新的企劃，說不定能賺更多。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	So, another question would be that if you get the sole custody with your daughter, would you bring her to Canada and stay in Canada forever and would not come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask this question is that even though you get the custody, your wife still has the visitation right to see your daughter. If you bring your daughter to Canada, it will become that you isolate your daughter from your wife. At this point, what is your opinion?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已在台灣待了四五年，我有居留證也喜歡這個地方，目前為止，我沒有任何計畫打算離開台灣。我認為我女兒有權可以看到我們雙方，我想強調的是即便我和我老婆在打離婚官司，但沒有打算切斷她們母女之間的關係。在整個離婚訴訟中，我也常寄女兒的圖片給我妻子看，我甚至還計畫讓她和女兒一起出遊，讓他多看看我們的女兒

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	What you mean is that you have no intention to come back to Canada, Right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	有可能回加拿大也可能是因為我母親又老又病，所以我必須得回去，就算我回去，也不會待太久，我不會考慮帶我女兒回去的可能。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	I will ask questions for the other side. You did not live with your husband, right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	We are separated for at least six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	 That is to say is that before you file the case, you did not live together, right?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So, let me ask you about your living status. I mean whom do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son who is born in my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? What is the marriage with the defendant?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So, you are fighting for the child rearing right. Who is the child you fight with your husband?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son? How old is your daughter.

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old. My daughter is eight months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you leave out home, did your daughter come with you?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I left out home, I bring my daughter with me because she was just two months old at that time.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Who live with your daughter?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	My daughter lives with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there any agreement between you and him? Originally, your daughter lives with you. Why did your daughter live with him now?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place I live so far is small. Originally, our house was much bigger.Concerning for the environment, I think my husband’s house is better. I get my daughter to him.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	 For the objective circumstance, what I mean is that if your place has no change, it would be not good for your daughter. Why did you want to get the custody?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is my daughter with hard effort. How could I live without her? Besides, my husband is Canadian and his job is not stable. He has high possibility of coming back to Canada. In this way, I may not see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I want to get the custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	For your finical status, could you explain how you afford your daughter’s raising fee?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	So far we are in the progress of divorce case. I want to ask where my husband lives so far. For the finical status, I think that house will be suitable for my daughter. I have provided a piece of asset for the court. In addition to that, I have stable job which I can get forty thousand each month. I think I am able to raise my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	I want to the progress of your divorce case. Do you know when will the court make the judge or which day they will give answer?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure about that. We have to go to the court this Friday. I will send my concern to judge who is undergoing our case.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	OK, the court will send social workers to both sides to see our status. They will make the evaluation about how good is daughter to one side. The court will examine the report to make the decision which one is good to your daughter. Before that, will you consider the shared custody for both sides? The shared custody means that the daughter lives with father sometimes. For another time, she will live with mother.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人不太喜歡這樣的建議，因為我們女兒還小，他現在只有八個月大，我不希望她經歷在父母之間的轉換。對這麼小的兒童而言，一下子和爸爸住，一下又跟媽媽住，這對他們是困擾混淆的

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	 At this point, I am agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young, she is not able to or supposed to live this kind of environment.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	 In this way, the court will send social workers. After they make full report, we will arrange the date of court. By doing so, both sides have rights to make statements, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我可以接受社工拜訪

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I have no further question about that.

en-US	Today, judge wants to clarify your different point of view on this custody case. And I would like to know that why both of you think that you’re more appropriate to raise this child. Please say your statement according to this point. And I also know that you’re on the divorce trial. Therefore, I hope there would be not(no) verbal attack in this court.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了。

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	First, I would like to ask some questions to the plaintiff. Why do you want to ask for the right of child rearing? As I know, now you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan. Plus, you’re also a foreigner. When it comes to the child rearing, why do you think that you’re more appropriate to raise the child?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我想要請求我孩子的扶養權基於以下兩個原因。首先我的太太現在已經沒有和我同住了。我想要看著我的孩子成長。此外我也聽說我的太太現在和另一名男子同住，所以就此原因我很懷疑她是否能夠好好照顧小孩，因此我想要要求全權的扶養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that though you’re still on the divorce trial, you two didn’t live together now? Also you doubt that she is live with another man? Is that the reason that you don’t want to give your daughter to be taken care from(by) her?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的，這是我主要的考量。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	In addition, as for the financial status, if you have the custody, how would you like to raise your daughter?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	事實上，我現在的確沒有全職的工作。但是我現在有打好幾份工、有固定的收入，我認為我的收入足夠養活我自己和我的女兒。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	Do you mention that you have several part-time jobs? Because they’re all part-time jobs, so can you promise that how much you will receive as regular income per month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均會打四到五個工。大概總收入是五萬元。有時候如果我接到新的工作，我就會有更多的收入。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Another question is that would you bring your daughter back to Canada if you get the custody. The reason why I’m asking this question is that even if you receive the custody, but your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada that means you use another way to separate your daughter and your wife and that’s violated the visitation right. What do you have to say upon this point?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了。我已經拿到居留證了而且我也很喜歡這個地方。至今我還沒有要離開台灣。尤其我也認為我的女兒應該要有權力可以時常看到她的雙親。我想要強調的是儘管我們現在正在打離婚訴訟，但我並沒有想要把她和我太太拆散的意思。在我們打離婚官司的期間我常常有寄女兒的照片給她啊。我甚至有安排她們一起出去讓她們有更多的機會相處。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you don’t have the intention to go back to Canada recently?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	 不會，我只是可能會因為我母親年長而且生病的原因回去而已。就算我回去了我也不會待太久。我更不會考慮說會把女兒帶過去。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	 Then I would like to ask a few questions to the other party. Are you living with your husband now or not?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes. We separated for about six month.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you raise the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	Maybe about two month ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	That means before you filed the divorce case you two hadn’t lived together, right?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	Now do you live with someone?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son and is from my ex-husband.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	You said that your son belongs to your first husband, so what is(how about) this time?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So let me clarify this. The daughter is the children(child) between you and your second husband?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and how old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and mu daughter is just eight months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you went out to live, whom did your daughter stay with?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I lived out, my daughter is just two months, so my daughter needs a lot of care, so she lived with me at that time.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Now, who have(has) the child now?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	She lives with my husband now.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Do you have any agreement? Why did your daughter live with you and now don’t(doesn’t) and lives with your husband now?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	I moved to a smaller place and my husband’s home is bigger, so my daughter stays with him. It’s a more appropriate environment for my daughter, so I leave my daughter to him.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstances, I mean the living environment, don’t change, it’s still not good for your daughter, right? Then why would you like to file for the custody?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I was pregnant for totally ten months and have her. How could I leave her alone? In addition, my husband is a Canadian. He doesn’t have a regular job. He doesn’t have fixed income. And maybe one day he will go back to Canada. If that’s the case, maybe I will never see my daughter. Therefore I would like to receive my daughter’s custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Can you explain further on the point of financial status to proof that you can raise your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now we’re still on the divorce case. I hope the result would be that my daughter will still live at the place that my husband lives in now. That would be a really good place for my daughter to grow up. As for my personal financial status, I have provide(d) the court my asset list. In addition I have a regular income per month. Every month I receive over 40,000 dollars. I think I have the ability to raise my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	So how’s your divorce case? How does the process go? Is there a set time that the result will come out?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not sure. We will have the divorce court this Friday. I hope I can state my hope to that judge that I want the result to come out soon.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Then we will sent(send) social workers to both of your parties. Besides, we will evaluate how you two take care of your child. We will consider their report and see who will be more appropriate to raise the child. Before that, I would like to ask both of you, do you have the will to have shared custody. The shared custody means that the child lives with one of the parent for a period of time and lives with the other for another period of time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人不是很贊成因為我們的孩子還很小。她只有八個月大而已欸，我不想要她一直經歷環境上的改變，在我和我太太之間來來去去的。對一個年紀還這麼小的孩子而言，如果她要一下跟爸爸住，一下跟媽媽住，她可能會很混亂。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	On this point, I agree with him. Our daughter is still young and little and it’s not appropriate to have the shared custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Since that, we will sent(send) the social workers first. When they hand in their report, we will set another court. Then you will have the opportunities to state your opinion.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	是的，我同意讓社工來探視。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I have no problems.

en-US	4 floor No.415, Sec. 2, Zhongcheng Rd., Shilin Dist., Taipei City

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today we are here for the child rearing case of Mr. Johnson and Ms. SHIH. Both you have your lawyer?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有律師

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today the court is to realize your will at child rearing. The court also like to know that each of you, what privilege you have to raise this child. Please focus on this point to deliberate, okay?Besides, I’m aware that you are going to divorce nowTherefore, I hope that both of you do not make any verbal attack, okay?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	The plaintiff, why is your reason for you to ask child rearing? As far as I know, you don’t have a full time job in Taiwan.Also you are a foreigner. In the case of strive for child rearing, what do you think you are more capable of?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望得到我孩子全部的扶養權，因為我覺得這樣對他比較好。 第一個理由，我太太之後不會跟我們住在一起了。我想要看著我的女兒成長。而且我聽說我的太太已經跟別的男人同居一起了。如果真的是那樣的話我懷疑他能提供給我女兒一個好的環境。因此我希望我能得到全部的扶養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean that though you are still preparing divorce, and your wife has already lived with other man? And you also doubt that she lived with other man? It is because of that you don’t want your daughter to live with her?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對，這就是我主要考慮的原因

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	About your financial status, what are you going to do after you gain your daughter’s sole custody? 

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在確實是沒有一份全值的工作但是我有間很多份工作，這些工作就能提供給我穩定的收入。我認為我的收入足夠能支付我的生活和照顧我女兒

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned you have several part-time job Because all the jobs you said is part-time, can you expect how steady income every moth?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	平均來說，有四到五個兼職工作所以加總起來大概有一個月五萬塊如果有時候有些新的案件的話，我還會有些新的收入

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Another question I want to ask you will you take your daughter back to Canada after you get her whole custody?The reason I ask this question is because that even of you get the sole custody, your wife may have the chance to come to see her.If you decide to bring your daughter back to your country, that will be another way that you cut the tie with her mother.About this point what is your reason?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經再台灣待了五年了我有這裡的居留證，而且我也很喜歡這邊。到目前為止我還沒有打算要離開台灣 而且我也覺得我的女兒有他的權利可以來看兩方的父母。我想澄清一點就是，雖然我和他母親正準備要離婚，但我沒有打算要切斷他們母女的聯繫 在我們打官司的這段期間，我也會固定地寄女兒的照片給她我也會安排一些活動讓我三個能一起出去。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean currently you don’t have any plan to go back to your country?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	對，我有可能會回去就是因為我媽媽年老了可能生病。可是就算我回去加拿大，我也不會在那邊久留。而且我也不會考慮把我女兒一起帶回去

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	So now let me ask the defendant. Now you are not live with your husband, is that right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have been separated for six moths.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you decided to file the case of divorce?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two moths ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So you mean before you file the divorce case, you were no longer live together?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	yes

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So what id you living condition? I mean, who did you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son of my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	The first marriage? So what is the time marriage with the plaintiff?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So now the custody you are fighting for is with your second husband?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	yes

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son? How old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven yeas old and my daughter is eight months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, the daughter is with you or your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I moved out, my daughter is little and she needs my taking care of.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	So now the child is with who?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now she is with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there any agreement between you? Why the daughter was with you and now with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place I later lived is smaller, the original house with my husband is bigger. So as the living environment, the house with my husband is better for her.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So if you don’t change, change your living condition, it is still she lives with your husband is better, isn’t it? So why do you want to have the sole cutosty?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is my daughter that I bear her for ten months and I give birth to her.Also my husband is Canadian and he didn’t have a full time job. So he, she might go back to Canada in any time. In that case, I might not see my daughter forever. That is the reason I want to strike the custody of my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	As your financial status, can your elaborate more details how you would like to take care of your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
zh-TW	我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。 至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	May I ask the ??Do you know when the result will made? 

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure about this.We will go to the court this Friday.I will have the court that the case can be done as soon as possible.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Okay, the court will plan the social workers to visit both of youThey will made the evaluations of the condition you with your childAnd the court will consider the result according to their evaluationsBefore we started that, will you consider the share custody? The shared custody means that the child with the mother for a time and with the father for the rest of time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	現階段我不同意這個做法，因為她還太小 她才八個月大我不想因為我們的關係讓她受到影響像他這麼小的小孩，要他一下跟著爸爸，一下跟著媽媽，這實在太辛苦了

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	I agree with my husband at this point.Our daughter is too young to shared custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Well okay, we will arrange the social worker first.After they made the results, we will decide another date for court.To provide both of you to elaborate more.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我可以接受社工的安排

en-US	Today the court aiming… aims at knowing the status and the thoughts of the two parties. The court would like to know the reason why each of you consider yourself is more suitable to keep the child. Please verify more… tell us more details about this… point. In addition, I know…the court knows the two parties…. is under the divorce case. So I hope that the two parties will not have any verbal attack to each other.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Plaintiff, I have some questions for you. Plaintiff, what’s the reason that you want to strive for the custody of raising your child? As far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan now. And you are a foreigner. In the case of fighting for the child rearing custody, why do you feel you will be more suitable?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望法院能判我女兒的全部撫養權給我, 那我有兩個理由.首先是, 我的太太已經沒有跟我們住在一起了, 我想要親眼看著我的孩子長大, 而且我也聽說我的太太已經跟別的男人同居了, 如果這事情是真的的話, 那我懷疑她有辦法給我們孩子最好的照顧, 因此我希望能得到所有的撫養權

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean by that your wife hasn’t lived with you, even if you are now filing for the divorce case? And you also doubt that she lives with another man? Because of these situations that you are not willing to give her the right to raise the child?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的,這就是我主要的原因

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	As for your personal financial status, what do you plan…..how do you plan to raise your daughter without a full-time job?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在的確沒有一份全職的工作, 但我身兼好幾份兼職工作, 而且帶給我一份穩定的收入, 我認為我賺來的錢是足夠我和我的女兒生活的

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs, since they are all part-time jobs, can you possibly count how much money you can make every month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我有四到五個兼職工作, 總加起來大概有台幣五萬塊, 如果有更多的計畫或工作給我的話, 我就可以得到更多的錢

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Another question I would like to ask you, after you have the rights…the custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and will not come back anymore? The reason why I ask you is that even if you get the custody, your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring the kid back to your country, it can be counted as a another way to cut the ties of the daughter with her mother. As for this point, what is your opinion?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了, 我有居留證, 而且我也喜歡這個地方, 到目前為止我並沒有打算要離開台灣, 而且我也認為我的女兒有權利見到她的雙方父母親, 我想強調的是, 雖然我和我的太太正在進行離婚官司, 但我絕對不會想要切斷他們的母子的連繫, 在我們打官司的期間, 我都會固定寄我女兒的照片給我的太太, 我也會安排出遊, 就是她和我, 以及我女兒一起出遊的機會

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean that currently, recently, you don’t have the intention to go back to your country?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	我可能會因為我的母親…在加拿大的母親比較老了或是病了而回國, 但就算我回去我也不會在那邊留很久, 我甚至不會考慮要把我的女兒帶去加拿大

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Okay I would like to ask another party. So now you don’t live with your husband now right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have been separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	What’s the time when you file the divorce case

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	That is to say, before you file the case of divorce, you two didn’t live together.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So what’s your situation of your accommodation? I mean, who do you live with now?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son, which… who is from my first marriage

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? So… what’s………. this marriage?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He’s my second husband

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	The custody you’re striving for, is the custody of a daughter of your second husband, right?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is… are you daughter and your son?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is 7 year-old and my daughter is eight months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, was your daughter with you or with your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I moved out, because my daughter was 2 months …. in the year of 2 months, she needed me, so she was with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	For now, where is your child, with you or your husband?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	She is with my husband now.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Was any agreement between you two, why was your daughter with you at first and then now with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place I moved in is smaller and the original house we lived in is bigger. Concerning the environment, I decided to give my daughter to my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	In the case of the objective circumstances, if your accommodation is still… that, it is not improved yet, is it better for your daughter? So why would you like to strive for the custody?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I borned her with 10 months. How could I bear the pain of being separated with her? Also, my husband is a Canadian, the jobs he has in Taiwan isn’t…aren’t very stable and he might go back to Canada. In that case, I cannot see my daughter anymore. That’s the reason why I would like to strive for my daughter’s custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Concerning your financial status, can you elaborate how would you like to arrange the money to raise your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now we are under the divorce case, I hope to get the house we used to live together, that it the house my husband is living now. Concerning the environment, the house will be very suitable for my daughter to grow up. As for my financial status, I’ve provided the court…. my asset list. In addition, I have a stable job, which may have me owned 40,000 dollars at least. I think I can take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	May I ask how your divorce case proceed? Do you know when the trial will be.. approximately will be?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not sure about that. We have to go to the court on Friday again. I will tell the court that I hope the trail and the result will come out as soon as possible

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Ok, the court will arrange the social workers to visit both parties, they will evaluate how you deal with your daughter…. The court will consider the result and decide what’s the best result for your daughter. Before that happens, I would like to ask the two parties, will you two consider the shared custody? That is, the child will accompany the mother for a period of time and then accompany with the father for another period of time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人不太喜歡這樣的決定, 因為我的女兒還太小了, 她才8個月大而已, 我不希望她在我和我妻子之間來來回回的, 對一個這麼小的孩子來說, 她會非常疑惑, 為什麼一下跟這個… 一下跟爸爸一下跟媽媽… 相處一段時間

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	I agree with my husband at the point. Our daughter is too young, it will not be a good resolution to use the shared custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Okay, so we will arrange the visit of social workers first. After they make the report, we will set the court date afterward, and the both parties will have the chance to elaborate themselves, is that okay with you?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	是的, 我可以接受社工人員的探訪

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I have no further questions as well.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today we are going to do the preparing procedure of child rearing custody between Ferry Johnson and彩雲史.Do both parties have a lawyer?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I do have a lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有請律師

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today, the court is going to know the parties’ opinion about today’s procedure in child rearing custody.I also wonder why both parties think … you are … the more suitable person than the other party.Please elaborate more on this point.In addition, I know you both are also doing the divorce case.Therefore, I hope both won’t have much verbal attack to each other.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Plaintiff, what is your reason to fight for the custody of children?As far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job regularly in Taiwan.Also you are a foreigner.In this case, why do you think you are the more appropriate person to have the custody of children?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望我可以獲得我女兒的全部撫養權，有以下兩個原因首先，我太太已經不和我們住在一起了我想要參與我女兒的成長過程此外，我還聽說我的…妻子已經和另一個男人同居了如果真的是那樣的話，我很懷疑她是不是能好好地照顧我的小孩因此，我希望我可以獲得全部扶養權

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that even you both still engage in the divorce case, your wife…already lived with another man?And you also doubt that she lived with another manBased on this situation, it is the reason why you don’t want to give the custody of children to your wife?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對，那是我最主要的考量

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	In addition, concerning your personal financial status, do you really be able to raise your child?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在確實是沒有全職的工作但是我有許多的兼職工作，讓我有固定的收入我相信這些收入是足夠能讓我扶養我的女兒的

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that you have several part-time jobs.Because these jobs are all part-time, can you approximately come up the total regular income you will receive?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我大概有四到五份兼職工作平均每個月這些薪水加起來的話，大概會有五萬塊的薪水如果有時後有新的案子進來的話，我的收入就會更高

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	I also want to ask a question that if you…are granted with the custody of the child, will you bring the child back to Canada and never come back.The reason why I ask this question is that even if you are granted with the custody of the child, your wife still have the visitation right to the child.If you do bring your child back to Canada, it is kind of … behavior to cut the tie with your wife and the child.To this point, what is your explanation?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我來台灣待了五年了我有居留證，我也很喜歡這個地方目前為止，我並沒有任何要回家加拿大的計畫我覺得我的孩子有權利見他們的父母的我想要強調的是，即使我和我的妻子仍在打離婚訴訟，但我沒有想將我的孩子與我的妻子完全隔離關係就在打離婚訴訟的期間，我也常常將孩子送去給我妻子那邊，讓他們有相處的時間我甚至還跟她約一些時間，希望她可以和我還有小孩共度一些時間

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	Therefore, you mean, in the recent period, you don’t have any plan to go to Canada? Is that right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	不，我還是有可能會回去加拿大的，因為我的母親很老了，而且她生病了即使我回去了，我也不會在那邊停留太久時間的我甚至不會考慮帶我的小孩一起回加拿大

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Then I’m going to ask some questions to the other party.Do you…no longer live with your husband now?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we …have lived separately for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	I filed the case around two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So, before you filed the divorce case, you…no longer lived with your husband already.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So can you tell me what is your … I mean who do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son of my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? So what is … this marriage?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So now the custody … you are argue about is the daughter of your second marriage.

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight-month old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out the house, was your daughter with your or your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I moved out the house, because my daughter … is still young, she went out with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Then now … who does the child live with?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now my daughter is living with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why the daughter lived with you first and now is living with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	After I moved out, the house I lived is a little bit small. My husband’s house is bigger.In terms of the environment, I think my husband’s house is better for my child so I gave my daughter to him.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstances don’t change, that is to say, …your daughter does live with your husband is a better choice.Then why do you want to be granted with the custody of your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is my daughter and I have spent ten months to give birth to her. I absolutely want her custody.In addition, my husband’s nationality is Canada. He also doesn’t have a full-time job. I’m concerning about that he might go back to Canada from time to time.In that case, doesn’t it mean that I can’t see my daughter?That is the reason why I want to be granted with the custody of my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	In terms of your financial status, can you elaborate how can you raise your child?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	So far, we are still in the divorce case.I hope I can be granted with the right to live in the house of y husband.As far as the house is concerned, I think that place is pretty good for my daughter to live.As for my financial status, I already sent a document about my asset list to the court.Besides, I also have a job. Every month, I have approximately at least forty thousand dollars as an income.I think I do have the ability to raise my child.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	May I ask how is your divorce case going?Do you know when the verdict will come out about your divorce case?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure.We will have the court this Friday about the divorce case.I would like to tell the court that I hope the verdict of the divorce case will come out soon.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Okay, we now will send some social workers to visit …both of you.In addition, they will evaluate your interaction with your child.We will …take their evaluation into account when deciding the verdict of this case.However, I want to ask that do both party would consider the joint custody.What joint custody means is that the child will spend some time with the Father and also the other time with Mother.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人是不想要這樣的裁定，因為我的女兒太小了她只有八個月大我不想她被我和我妻子之間送來送去的對於這樣歲數的小孩子來說，這樣的環境對他們來說也太混亂了吧，一下子和母親待一段時間，一下子和父親待一段時間

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	To this point, I agree with my husband’s opinion.My daughter is too young. We shouldn’t and don’t want to accept this verdict of joint custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	To this case, we are going to send social workers for visitation.After social workers make the report, we will resume the case.And at that time, you will have the floor to elaborate your opinion.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我對社工的部分沒有問題

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I’m fine with that, too.

en-US	Your honor. Today I mainly want to verify the child custody in the marriage. I would also like to know that why both of you think that you can raise the child alone. Please elaborate this point further. Besides, I also know that both of you are also under the case of divorce. Therefore, I hope that both of you can avoid verbal attack in this court.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	First, defendant, may I ask you some questions? Why do you want to fight for the custody of your child? Based on my understanding, you don’t a fulltime job in Taiwan, and you’re a foreigner. In the process of the fighting for custody, what’s your advantages?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望能夠得到小孩的全部扶養權，因為有以下兩個原因。首先我太太已經不跟我們住了。我想要陪在我孩子旁邊看他長大。此外，我太太也跟另外一個男人居住。如果這是真的的話，我懷疑我太太是不是能給我們的小孩最好的照顧。因此我想要單獨扶養。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that your wife is… when you’re fighting for the case of divorce, your wife no longer lives with you. Is that right? And you also doubt that she lives another man. Is it because of this kind of condition that you don’t want to share custody with her?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的，這些都是我主要的顧慮

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Besides, concerning your financial status, if you’re granted with the custody, what do you plan to raise your child?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在的確沒有全職工作。但是我有很多兼職工作，這也有份固定的收入。我相信這份收入能夠支撐我和我女兒的生活。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. So because they’re all part-time jobs, so could you tell us that how much money will you gain on a regular basis.

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	平均而言我有四到五個兼職工作。總共來說大概會有五萬塊的收入。有時候如果有新的計劃的時候，我也會有額外的收入。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	My another question is that will you bring your daughter back to Canada and no longer stays in Taiwan after you’re granted with the custody? The reason why I asked so is that even if you are granted with the custody, your wife may also be granted with the visitation right. If you bring your child back to Canada, you will become, to a degree, cut the tie between your wife and your child. To this, what’s your plea?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年。我有居留證，我也喜歡這個地方。目前為止我沒有任何離開台灣的計畫。特別是因為我認為我的女兒有權利見到爸爸媽媽。我想說的是，雖然我和我太太現在正在打離婚的官司，我從來沒有想過要切斷她和我女兒之間的聯繫。在整個離婚官司的過程中，我會固定寄女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至安排了一些行程，讓他和女兒能夠見面。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean that in the short run you don’t have the plan to go back to Canada.

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	我的確有回加拿大的打算，因為我母親年邁且身體不好。然而就算我回去加拿大的話我也不會待太久。我也不會考慮把女兒帶著一起回加拿大的可能。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Now, Ms. 石, I have some questions for you. Don’t you live with your husband anymore?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have been separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the case of divorce?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	In other words, much earlier before your filing divorce case, you no longer lives with him. Is that right?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So could you tell us your living condition? I mean, who do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son in my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? What the marriage between Mr. Johnson.

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He’s my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So, we’re dealing with the custody of your second husband and your daughter in your second marriage.

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and your daughter.

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, your daughter stays with who? You or your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I was moving out, because she’s only two months old, so she stayed with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	What does your daughter stay with?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now she lives with my husband?

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there some kind of arrangement between you two? Why was the daughter staying with you, and then is staying with your husband.

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The apartment after I moved out is quite smaller. The original house is bigger. In terms of the living condition, my husband can provide a better environment.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstances aren’t changed. Your living condition isn’t good for your daughter, isn’t it? Then why do you hope for the custody of your child?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is my child. It took me ten months to give birth to the baby. How could I be... and my husband is candadian, I’m not sure when he will go back to Canada, and his work isn’t stable. Then that means I can no longer see my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Therefore, I hope to fight for the custody. As for your financial status, could you elaborate that how you are going to raise your child.

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	We are currently in the case of divorce. I hope that I can get my husband’s house after the case. So in terms of the living condition, that house is very appropriate for my daughter. And as for my personal financial status, I have provided the court a copy of my asset list. Besides, I have a fulltime job. I can earn around 40000 per month. I think I am able to raise my daughter. 

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	So how’s your divorce case going? When will the court’s decisions be made? I mean do you roughly know the time?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not sure about it. This week we have another court. I want express my idea to the court that I wish the court can be finished as soon as possible.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Now let us do this. The court will arrange social workers to your children. And they will make evaluation about the relationship between you and your child. That will be the court’s reference to see who is better for the child. Before that I want to ask that will you consider the possibility of shared custody? The definition of shared custody is that the child stays with father for some time and stays with the mother for another time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人不喜歡這個提案，因為我女兒還太小，他只有八個月大。我不希望他在我和我太太之間搬來搬去。這個方式對這麼年幼的小孩來說太混淆了，怎麼可以讓她一下跟爸爸住一下跟媽媽住呢

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	Concerning this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small. She is not supposed to go through the process of shared custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	So we will have the social workers get to you first. After they finish the report, we will arrange the court date to give the opinion rights of both parties.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我對社工探視沒有意見

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I’m fine with it too, thanks.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today we are here for preparation procedure between Ferry Johnson and TSAI YUN SHR of their child rearing. Do both parties have the lawyers?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	 I have a lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有請任律師。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today, we just want to know the both parties’ status of this case. We also want to know why both parties think they are more suitable for child rearing. Please just state for this point. And, I know you just in the case of divorce. In the court, we don’t want to see verbal attack.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解。

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	First, I want to ask the questions. Plaintiff, why do you want to have the custody of your child? As I know, you don’t have full-time job now in Taiwan. And you are a foreigner. Why would you think you are more suitable for this case?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望得到孩子的扶養權因為下列的原因。首先，我的老婆不再陪著我們。我想要跟著我的女兒一起成長。此外，我知道我的老婆和別的男人現在正在一起。如果那是真的，我很懷疑我的老婆是否有辦法好好照顧我們的女兒。因此，我希望能爭取全部扶養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean that you are in the case of divorce with your wife, and she doesn’t live with you now? And you think she lives with other man? Because of this concern, you don’t want to your child lives with her?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	沒錯，那就是我所擔憂的。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Furthermore, it’s about your financial status. If you have the custody of your child, what’s your plan?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	沒錯，我現在在台灣並沒有全職的工作。但是我有七份兼職工作，那使我的收入跟全職收入一樣多。我相信這樣的收入足夠負擔我和我女兒的生活費。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mention that you have many part time jobs. Because all of them are part time jobs, you think you may have how much fixed income every month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均有四到五份兼職工作。平均來說，我一個月會有五萬元收入。有時候如果我額外接收到工作，我會有更多的收入。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	For the other question that I want to ask is that if you get the custody of your child, will you go to Canada and never come back again? I asked the question just because even if you have the custody, your wife may remain the visitation right. If you bring your child to your country, it may become a problem that you deliberately separate the child and your wife. For this point, what’s your point?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣生活了五年，我擁有居留證而且我喜愛這個地方，到目前為止我沒有離開台灣的任何打算，而且我的女兒有權利見到我和我太太。我必須強調的是，即使我和我太太正在進行離婚官司，但我並沒有想要切斷小孩和我太太的關係。在打官司的期間，我也有將我女兒的照片傳給我老婆。我甚至鼓勵他和我女兒見面。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that you don’t have the plan to go back your country, right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	也不是這樣說，我也是有可能回去看我的母親，因為她已經很老了。就算我回去的話，我也不會在那邊待很久，我甚至考慮帶我女兒一起去的可能性。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Ok. I want to ask the question of the other party. So, do you live with your husband now?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	We live separately for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file a divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	Maybe two months before.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So, before you filed the case, you didn’t live with your husband?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	What’s you living status? I mean, you live with whom?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son who is from my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So, the custody that we concern about is between your second husband and you?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	 How old is your son? And how old is your daughter? 

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old. My daughter is eight months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you went out, your daughter lived with you or your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	 Because when I went out, my daughter was only 2 months, she needed me and she lived with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	 Now, the child lives with whom?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now, my daughter lives with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Do you have any agreement? Why your daughter lived with you first, and now she lives with your husband? 

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	  The place that I live now is not big so my child lives with my husband. For environmental concern, my daughter lives with my husband now.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	Just for the objective circumstances, the situation for your daughter is not good, right? Why would you have the custody of your child?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is my child, how could I live without her? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian, and he might go back to Canada any time. If that’s a case, I cannot meet my daughter anymore. So, I want to have the custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	For your financial status, can you explain more that how would you rear your child?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	We are in divorce case now. I hope, after the case, I can live in the house that my husband lives now. The house is good for my daughter to grow up. For my financial status, I just turned in my asset list for the court. Furthermore, I have a job, and the income is NT40000 each month. I think I can be capable of rearing my child. 

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	How’s your divorce case now? When will the sentence out? 

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure. This Friday, we will go to the court again. I want to tell the judge who charges our divorce case that I hope the sentence out fast.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Ok, so, the court will arrange the social workers to visit both parties. And the social workers will evaluate the situation. After the court sees the report, we will think who is better for the child. But before that, do both parties want to share the custody? The term of shared custody means that sometimes the child lives with father and sometimes lives with mother.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	 就目前來說，我並不想這麼打算，因為我的小孩還太小。她只有八個月大，我不希望她一直在我和我老婆之間來來回回。對於這麼小的小孩來說，對於她一下要來這邊一下要去那邊，會讓她感到困擾。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	For this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small, and it’s not suitable for shared custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	We will arrange social workers’ visitation first. After they finish the report, we will set the next court date. Both parties will have chance to state, is that ok?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	是的，我對於社工參訪沒有意見。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	Yes.

en-US	First, I want to ask some question of the defendant. Would you please state why you want the custody of your child? As I know, you do not have a full-time job in Taiwan, and you are a foreigner, in the case of child rearing, why do think you are more better then the other?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望你能夠把女兒全部的撫養權都判給我。第一點是：我的妻子沒有和我住在一起了。我希望看著我的孩子成長。此外，我也聽說我的妻子現在正和其他男人住在一起。如果這是事實的話，那我會懷疑我的妻子是否能給我們的女兒最好的照顧。因此這就是我希望有全部撫養權的原因。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	 Do you mean you and your wife are having the divorce trial, and she does not live with you, and you also suspect that she is living with another man, so because of the two reasons you do not want to let your wife have the custody, is that right?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	沒錯，那是我主要的考量。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Besides, at the point of the financial status, if you have the sole custody of your daughter, what would you do?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在沒有全職的工作是個事實。但是我有幾份固定的收入，能夠幫助我們生活。我相信這幾份收入可以讓我和我女兒過生活。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You mentioned before that you have several part-time jobs, because those are part-time jobs, can you guarantee that you will have a fixed income?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平常有4～5份的兼職工作。總收入來說，它可以帶給我一萬五。如果我有其他的…額外工作的話，會帶我更多的收入。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	The next question is if you have your daughter’s custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and do not come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask is when you have the custody, but your wife also have the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, it will cut your daughter’s  ties with your wife. What’s your opinion about this point?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經待在台灣5年了。我有居留證，我也喜歡台灣。目前我並沒有離開台灣的打算，特別我認為，我的小孩有權…應該要有機會能夠看到父母。我想要強調的是，雖然我和我的妻子正打算離婚，但是我並沒有打算切斷他們母女的關係。就算我們在打離婚官司的期間，我也會定期寄照片給我的妻子。我甚至安排家庭聚會的時間，讓她和我們的女兒跟我一起見面，培養感情。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	Currently, you do not have the plan to go back, is that right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	不，我可能會回去，但這是因為我母親年事已高又已經生病了。但是即使我回去，我也不會待在那裏很久。更不會想要把女兒帶過去。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Now, I am going to ask the other part some questions. Don’t you live with your husband?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When do you …the case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	Before you have the divorce trial, you have already not live with your husband, is that right?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	Then, who do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	 I live with my son which from my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? Then, which is this marriage you with the plaintiff?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	Now，you are fighting the custody with your second husband and this child is a daughter.

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	Then how old is you son? And how old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight-month …year old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, does your daughter live with you or with your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	Because when I moved out, my daughter was just two- month old, she needed my care , so she was with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	And now, who does your daughter live with?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now my daughter live with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Do you have some agreements with your husband? Why does your daughter fist live with you, but with your husband later?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The house I moved into is smaller than the house I lived with my husband. So take the environment into consideration, I think our previous house is better for my daughter.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So, in the objective circumstance, which means the living environmental, if the house is the same as yours, you will live with your daughter, is that right? So why do you want to have the custody of your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I spend ten months bearing…to…, how could I live without her. And my husband is a Canadian, and he does not have regular income, he might have the possibility to go back to Canada any time. If that happens, I would not see my daughter anymore, that’s the reason why I wan to my daughter’s custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Please describe detailedly about how will you raise your child, concider your financial status.

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now, we are having the divorce case. I want to ask the court to sentence the house, which I lived with my husband before for me. So thinking about the environment, the house is a good place for my children to grow up. As for my financial status, I have already provided my own asset list to the court; otherwise, I also have a regular income, which is probably 40000(forty thousand) a month. I think I have the capability of taking good care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	How is your divorce trial? Do you know when do the divorce case end?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure, we will have the court on this Friday. I will say to the judge of our divorce case that I wan to end the case as soon as possible.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Okay, the court will send social worker to visit both of your houses, and evaluate how is your daughter’s relation with each of you. The court will take those two factors into consider, and consider who will give the daughter the best …condition. Before we give the custody, do you have the willingness to have shared custody? The shared custody means the child live with the parent …live with the father for a while, and live with the mother for a while.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	就我個人的意見的話，我不贊同共同撫養，因為我的女兒還太小，她只有八個月大。我不想她不能適應我跟妻子之間的變動。對一個這麼小的小孩來說，跟父親或母親只住在一起一段時間會造成她的混淆。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	In this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small, she is not …the shared custody is not good for her.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	So, we just arrange the social worker first. After they have their reports, we will set another court date. At that time, both of you will have the chances to state your opinions.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我對社工探訪的這件事沒意見

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I do not have problems, thank you.

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有雇用律師

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today I want to understand the stances of both parties for child rearing. And the other question I want to know is that why both parties think that he or she is best for the child rearing. And according to this question, I want you both can elaborate in detail. Because I know you are in the divorce case. And I don’t want you both make the verbal attack to each other.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的,我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	At first I want to ask the plaintiff. Why do you want to fight for the child rearing right? According to the file, you don’t have the regular job in Taiwan, and you are the foreigner. Why do you think are more appropriate for the child rearing right?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我認為應該要將全部的撫養權判都給我,因為我真的非常關心他,我有兩個原因,第一是因為我的妻子根本沒有跟我們住在一起,我想跟我的女兒一起長大,而且我聽說我的前妻現在跟別的男人同居,如果事實真的是這樣的話,我很懷疑他是否能夠給我女兒一個很好的成長環境,因此我希望我能擁有全部的撫養權

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that your although you ex-wife is in divorce case with you but she live with another man. Moreover, you doubted that she is live with other man. Do you concern she’s situation, so you don’t the child rearing to granted to you wife?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	事的,這就是我所關心的

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	 According to you financial status, what will you going to do if you get the child rearing right?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我知道我現在目前是沒有固定的收入,但是我有幾分兼職的工作可以讓我收入很穩定,我相信那些收入對我和我女兒來說是非常足夠的

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You mention that you have several part time job. Because they are part time job, can you promise you have the regular income?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均都有四到五份的兼職工作,平均來說我一個月都可以領四萬台幣左右,如果我有更好的工作阿或計畫的話我會有更多的收入

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	The other question I want to ask you is if you get the child rearing right, would you bring you daughter to Canada and would not come back Taiwan? I want to ask this question is even if you get the child rearing right, you wife still have the visitation right. If you bring you daughter to your country, on other hand to say that you are separated them. For this case, do you have any explanation?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經住在台灣五年了,我有居留證,而且我也很喜歡這個地方,到目前為止我並沒有要離開台灣的打算,而且我想我的女兒有權力去見他的雙方父母,我必須強調的是,雖然我現在跟我的現任妻子正在打離婚官司,但是並不是說我要切斷他們所有的連繫,在我和我老婆打離婚官司這個期間,我還是有固定江我女兒照片發給我老婆看,我甚至鼓勵我老婆可以常常和我女兒就是可以出門走走希望增進感情

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you don’t have plan to back your country.

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	也不是完全不可能,因為我的母親正在生病,不過就算我回去也不會待很久,因為我想要將我女兒……….

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Now I want to ask the other party some questions. Do you separate with your husband now?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we are separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	It’s to say before you file the divorce case, you both were not living together, right?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	And what’s your living circumstance? I mean who do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son of first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? So the marriage with the ………..

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So the child rearing right today here you both fight for is your second husband’s daughter, right?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old are your son and your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son id 7 years old and my daughter is 8 months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you live outer, did your daughter live with you or your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	Because when I went out, my daughter still 2 months old, so she has to live with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	So now where is your daughter? With you or your husband?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now my daughter is with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Did you have any agreement because your daughter is lived with you but now is live with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The house I live now is smaller and the previous one is my husband’s house is much bigger. For environment, my daughter live with my husband is the best choice.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	The objective circumstance, I mean the living environment does not change, does your daughter live with your husband is better than you. So why do you want to fight for the child rearing right?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I have pregnant for ten moths, I can’t live without her. She is my baby. Moreover, I husband is Canadian, he is probably go back to Canada anytime, in that case, I can’t see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I want to right for my daughter’s custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	According to your financial status, can you explain what will you going to do to care with your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now we are in divorce case, I want to fight for the living right in currently my husband lived house. According to the environment that house is the vest choice for my daughter. About my financial status, I had provided my asset list to the court. Furthermore, I have fixed income. I have 40000 NT dollars every month. I think I have the right and the ability to take are my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	How is your divorce case? When is the decision comes out? Or the precise time?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure. This Friday we have to go to the court again. I want to state to the court that I want the decision comes out quickly.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Ok I will arrange the social workers to both parties’ house. And they will make the evaluation of the living situation of you both with your daughter. The court will make the decision concerning the social workers’ evaluation. But before that circumstance, I want ask you both, do you consider the shared custody. It means the living time will change from time to time with you both. Rather. It means the daughter will live with the husband some time and other time will live with the wife. 

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	目前我並沒有這個打算,因為我覺得我女兒還太小了,她只有八個月大,我不想它異質精力這種在父母親之間的改變,對這麼小的小孩來說它是沒有辦法適應必須一下子跟這個至親在一起一下子跟那個親人在一起

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	Upon this point, I have the same idea with mu husband. My daughter is too young to suit the shared custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Ok, so at first I will arrange the social workers‘ visitation. After their report comes out, I will arrange the other court. And in this court, you both have the time to explain.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	是的,我對社工的考察沒有意見

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。

zh-TW	台北市士林區忠誠路3段414號5樓
en-US	F5. 414… No. 414, Zhongcheng Road. 3…um…Zhongcheng Road, Shilin District, Taipei City.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today we are here for the Mr. Johnson and Ms. …. Shi child rearing case. Um…does doth side have your lawyers?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我有請律師。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Um… today…today the court wants to know both side’s statement about child rearing and what’s your opinion about it. And I...um…the court also want to know why both side think you all…you’re the suitable person for the child rearing. Please put more…um…put more attention on thin, please. Besides, I know both of you have the case of the divorce…divorce. So…today I don’t want any verbal attack, understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	So first I want to ask the plaintiff a few questions. Please tell me why do you want the sole custody of your children? As my un…for my understanding, you don’t have a… you don’t have a full time job or regular income I n Taiwan. Also, you are a fore…fore…foreigner. So, in this case, why you think you are more suitable for this… for the children…for the child rearing?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望擁有我兩個女兒的全部扶養權，有兩個原因。首先，我太太已經不和我們一起住了。我希望能看著我女兒成長。恩…再者，我聽說我太太目前正在和別的男人同居。如果真的是這樣子的話，我很懷疑她是不是能夠讓我小孩擁有…得到應有的照顧。這就是為什麼我希望可以擁有全部扶養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean…um…even you and your wife are still in the case…in the divorce, that she’s no longer live with you? And you also doubt that she lives with the other…another man? So base on such situation, so you are not willing to give your child…your daughter to her. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對，就是這樣。這是我最主要的考量。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Otherwise, to consider your… in the consideration of your financial status, if you do have the sole custody, so how do you going to raise your child…your daughters?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在確實是沒有全職的工作。但是我目前有幾份的打工，讓我有固定的收入。我相信這些收入足夠扶養我自己和我的女兒們。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	So you just mention that you have several part-time jobs. So because they are part-times, can you give the basic…basic estivation… estitation that you can… how much money you can have each month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均有四到五份兼職。所以平均每個月可以有…一萬五的收入。如果有其他的工作的的話，會有更多的收入。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	So my another concern is that err if you have… if you have the custody, will you bring the daughters back to Canada and never come back? And why I ask this question is that even if you have the custody, your wife still might have the visitation right. So if you bring your daughters back to your country, then… in another way, it’s a kind way… it’s a kind of way of… cut the tie with your…cut the tie between your wife and daughters. So on this point, what’s your appoint…opinion?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待五年了，我有居留證，而且我喜歡這個地方，所以目前並沒有離開台灣的打算。尤其我覺得我的女兒有權利見到他的父親和母親。我想強調的是，雖然我和我太太正在打離婚官司，但我絕對並沒有想要把他們連結切斷的意思………並沒有把我太太和小孩的連結切斷的意思。即使在我們打官司的過程中，我還是會固定傳我女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至還安排了一些時間就是讓她…來和我們女兒一起團聚。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean you don’t…in recently… recently, you don’t have the plan to go back to your country, is that right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	恩…並不是，因為我可能會回去加拿大。因為我母親已經老了，而且她還生病。但即使我回去加拿大，我也不會待非常久的時間。我甚至可能不會考慮帶我女兒一起回去。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	OK now so I’m going to ask Ms…Ms. Shi few question. So you’re no longer lives with your husband, is that right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we are de…we are separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	Um… can you… when you…when you… when you… right, when you ask for the divorce? 

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	Around two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So is that mean, long before you… before you file the case, you’re no longer live together?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So can you tell me your… now your live situation? I mean… who do you live with? 

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I’m live with the… I’m live with my son from my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? So this is… this is which marriage do you have with our plaintiff?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He’s my second husband. He WAS my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So now the child rearing right we are arguing about is your… is with your second husband and your second daughters?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yep. 

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and your daughters?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and my daughter is only eight month years old…eight-month old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, um the daughter is with you or with the husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	Because when I moved out, my… our daughter is only two-month old so she is with me… she was with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	So now where the… who now does the child live with?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	So far, the daughter live with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there some kind of agreement between you two? Why the… why the first the daughter live with you, and now she lives with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	After I move out, the new house is a little bit smaller than the house we had. So our original house is… I think is better than the house I live for now, so I give the daughter to mu husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So if the objective circumstances, I mean the place you live, is nothing change, is there… is um… is not a very good place for your daughter, isn’t it? So why do you want to… why do you want the custody of your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I mean com’n, she’s… she’s the daughter I bear for ten months, so how can I live with… no longer… errr no chance to see her after all…um after all this? And besides, my husband is a Canadian, and part…and the time… and he doesn’t have a regular part in Taiwan. Moreover, he… he might go back to Canada at any times! So in that case, if he went back… if he go back to Canada, is… I might no longer… I might no longer have the chance to see my daughters. So that’s why I want to argue for our… my daughter’s sole custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Base on your financial status, can you elaborate how you’re going to raise your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	So far, we’re still seeking the divorce case. So I to fight for the right to live with the house my husband is live with…is live in. So base on that environment, I think the house will be a… will be a right place… will be a good place for raising my child. And my… talking about my financial status, I’ve already offer the court one of my asset list. Otherwise, I have a regular job, so my total income each month is average forty thousands. So I think I’m totally capable of raising my child… raising my children.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	May I ask your… your divorce case is in what progress? Is in what process? Is there any… any date that you are… you can expect that the judgment will… will come out?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not sure. We have go to the court this Friday. I want ask the judge on Friday… um our judgment will come out as soon as possible.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Okay, now, the court will arrange the social… a social worker to pay a visit to the plaintiff and the… to the husband and wife. And will make a evaluation about your… about your dealing…about your dealing situation between the father…between…um… between the parents and the children. And the court will make the judgment based on their evaluations and find out… find out what is the best situation for the children. Before that I have to ask, is shared-custody in your consideration? I mean the both side… The so-called shared-custody is means the children will live with both side and both a little… a little… um… with the father a period of time, and the other… and the mother a period of time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人不喜歡這樣的安排，因為我女兒還太小了。她才八個月大欸。我不想要她在我和我太太之間不斷來回。對於這麼小的孩子來說，這未免也太混亂了吧，要和其中…其中…要和雙親其中一方待一陣子，然後有和另外一方待一陣子。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	On this point, I agree with my husband. My… our daughter is still too young for… is too young… for this solution.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	So in this case, so we might…err…so we are… so for now, we are going to into the procedure for the social worker’s evaluation. After evaluation came…come out, then we will arrange another court. Let the both side have the chance to their statements. Is that ok with you?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我對社工的部分沒有問題。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I’m fine with that, thank you.

en-US	Today we are here for the preparation procedure for child rearing case for Ferry Johnson and彩雲史.Do you both have a lawyer?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I have a lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有律師

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today, in the preparation procedure, I would like to you… to know your position in the child rearing case and also I would like to know why you …both of you claim you are the appropriate person to rear the child.   Please elaborate this point. Besides, I know that you are also in the divorce case. So I don’t want to see verbal attack which you made on the other person.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我知道

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	First, I will inquire the plaintiff. Plaintiff, why do you want the custody to be granted to you? As I known, you don’t have a full time job in Taiwan, and also you are a foreigner. So why do you think you are …more capable?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我想要爭取小孩的監護權有個原因:第一我太太不再在跟我住，我想要看我小孩長大，而且我聽聞我太太跟一個男人同居，如果這是真的話，我懷疑她能給我女兒她應得的照顧，因此我希望擁有我女兒的扶養權

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean that you.. and your wife are still in the divorce case but she no longer live with you and also doubted her of living with another man. Is this the reason that you refuse… refuse to give the daughter … be taking care of.

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對這是我主要的考慮

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	As for your financial status, if you are granted for the sole custody, how are you going to take care of her?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在沒有全職的工作是真的，但是我有幾份兼差，有穩定收入，我相信這幾筆收入能足夠讓我照顧我自己跟女兒

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have a few part jobs. Because that are just part-time jobs. Can you … can you approximately count what income could you have each month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均有4到5個兼差，總共來說一個會有5萬多，有時候或許我有新案子，收入會更多

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Another question I would like to ask, if you are granted with the custody of your daughter. Will you back to Canada and you won’t come back? The reason I am asking this question is …. Even though you are granted with the custody of your daughter, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to your country, it will …. It will cut the lie.. between the daughter and mom. As for this point, what do you have to say?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年，我有居留證，我也喜歡台灣，目前我沒有計畫離開台灣，而且我相信我女兒應該要有機會看到爸爸媽媽，我想強調的是雖然我和我太太目前正在打離婚官司但我並沒有想要切斷女兒和媽媽的聯繫，在我們整個離婚官司的時候，我不時會傳些我女兒的照片給我太太，甚至還安排ㄧ些外出讓她能跟我們一起度過ㄧ些時光

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	You mean …. Recently you don’t have a plan to go back to your country, is that right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	不 我可能會回加拿大，因為我母親年紀大了又生病，但如果我回去的話，我也不會待很久，我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒回去

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Now I am going to ask some questions of the other party. Do you …. You don’t live t with your husband, right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes we have been separated for 6 months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	Around 2 months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	You mean before file the divorce case, you had not live with your husband?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	yes

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So can you tell me who you are living with now?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	 I am now living with my son which from the first marriage

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? So what is the marriage you and the plaintiff?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So the custody we are going to .. you are going to ask for is the child you had with your second husband? And she is a girl?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	yes

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son? How old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is 7 years old and my daughter is 8 months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you move out, the daughter goes with you or stays with your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	Because when the time I move out, my daughter was only 2 months, she is so little and she needs me, so I brought he

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	So who lives with the child?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now my daughter lives with my husband

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Do you and the plaintiff have found an agreement? Why the daughter was with you but now she lives with your husband.

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	 The place I moved out was little.. Littler than the house my husband was living.. for the environmental concern I give my daughter to my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstance did not change, your living environment is not good for your daughter, right? Why do you want to ask for the custody of your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is my daughter who I spent ten months in pregnant. How could I bear not to see her? My husband is from husband Canada and his job in Taiwan is not stable. He may go back to Canada anytime, if that is the case, I could not see my daughter anymore, therefore I would like to as for the custody for my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	For your financial status, could you tell how are you going to raise your child?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	We are now still in the divorce case. I hope to ask for the hose which my husband lives now. So … as the surroundings around for the house, it will be good for my daughter. As for my financial status, I had already shown an asset list to the court. Besides, I also have a stable job; the payment which I could get every month is above 40000 Dollars. I think I am capable in both ways to raise my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	How is your divorce going? Do know when the court’s decision will be made or …

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure. This Friday we will be on the court again for the divorce case. I would tell the judge that I would like to know the court’s decision for the divorce as soon as possible.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Ok.. So.. The court will arrange social workers to visit both of your houses. And also the social workers will make the evaluation of the situation you and the plaintiff have with your child. The court will take the results into consideration and consider what is best for the child. Before that, I would like to ask both of you, do you like to have shared custody. The shared custody I mean here is the daughter will spend some time with the father and some time with the mother.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人不喜歡這個安排，因為我女兒還太小，她只有八個月，我不想要她一直在我和我太太間送來送去，對一個只有八個月的小孩來說，她可能會產生困惑，有些時間和爸爸在一起有些時間和媽媽

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	At this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small. The arrangement should not .. could not be arranges as shared custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	So we will arrange the social worker to visit you houses. After they made the report, we will assign the next court day, so both of the parties will have the chance to state what you want to say. Is that ok?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	社工人員來訪沒有問題

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I am fine with that, thank you.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today our case is the child rearing case between Ferry Johnson and Tsai-Yung Shu. Have you all… Have you both appointed lawyers?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I have.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有…一名律師。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today for our preparatory case, my main goal today is to understand your main positions in the case. I would also like to know the reason why both of you believe you are more fitting to take care of the child. Could you please emphasize your views on this later on. Besides, I am also aware that you are in the court for divorce at the moment. So I would not like to hear any verbal attack between the two parties, do you understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Ok, first I would like to ask: Why do you want… the right to take care of your child. As far as I know, you do not have an official job in Taipei. You are also a foreigner. Why do you believe you are a more suitable person for custody?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望擁有我女兒的全部扶養權，因為兩個原因。首先，我老婆並沒有汗我住在一起。我想要看著我的女兒長大。另外我還有聽到我的老婆漢另外一個男人同住。如果這屬實，我深切地懷疑她是否適合照顧我們的女兒，於是我希望取得全部扶養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	What you mean is…while your wife has filed a divorce case with you, she is not living with you at the moment. And you have doubts about whether she is living with another man. And therefore, you are not willing to let your wife take care of your children, is that right?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的，這是我主要的顧慮。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Next is about your financial status, and that means, if you receive custody of your child, how will you deal with the money?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我的確沒有一個全職的工作，但我有幾個兼職的工作，所以…我是有收入的。我認為這些收入是夠照顧我自己與女兒的。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You mentioned you have many part time jobs. Because they are not fixed, can you estimate your fixed income for each month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均有四到五個…五份兼任的工作。加起來的話，大概會有一個月一萬五的收入。通常，如果我有新的專案的話，我就會有更多收入。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Next, I would like to ask you: If you received custody of your child, is it possible that you will bring your child to Canada, and never come back? My reason for asking this is even though you receive custody, your wife still has a visitation right. If you bring your child back to your country, it will equal…your preventing your wife from seeing the child. What do you have to say about this?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了，我有居留證我也喜歡這個地方。至今我還沒有任核計劃要離開。尤其是我覺得…我女兒應該有見到她父母的權利。我想要強調的是：即使我和我老婆正在進行離婚程序，但我並不想要阻絕我老婆和我女兒…相見的機會。我們在辦離婚手續的這段期間，我都會固定送女兒的照片給老婆看。我也會計劃一些戶外的活動…讓女兒和老婆見面。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean in the short term, you have no plans to go back to your country.

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	不是，我可能會回到加拿大，因為我媽媽年紀大了，也生病了。但即便我回去，也不會待太久。我甚至完全不會考慮將我女兒一起帶回去。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	OK, now I’d like to ask the other party. So, you are not living with your husband anymore?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we’ve been separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the case for divorce?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So you’ve been separated even before you filed a lawsuit for divorce.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So may I ask your living situation? What I mean is, who are you living with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I’m living with my son from my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? So, the marriage between you and the….defendant…which…

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So the custody that you both are seeking…. is for your second child, your daughter?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son? And how old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, did your daughter stay with the father or with you?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I moved out, the child was only six months old and needed me to take care of her, so she went with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	And who is the child with at this moment?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now the child is with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Have you reached any sort of agreement? Why was the daughter with you at the first point, and now with… the husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	My accommodation when I moved out is smaller than before. Considering the environment…the living environment, the old house was better, so I sent my daughter back.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So if the objective circumstances, or the living environment has changed, it’s not good for your daughter either, isn’t it? Then why would you want to fight for your child’s custody?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I bore her for ten months! How could I even consider leaving her? Besides, my husband is a Canadian citizen. He doesn’t even have a stable job. If so, I might never see my daughter again. So I wish to… to receive custody for my child.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Concerning your financial status, can you elaborate…more about how you will take care of your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	We are still in the middle of our divorce case. I wish to receive the house that my husband is living in right now. That would be a better environment for my daughter to grow up in. And about my financial status, I provided the court with my asset list. I also have a fixed job. I earn 40 thousand dollars each month. Or more. I think I’m capable of taking care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	How is your divorce case going? Have you estimated what time the courts decision will come out?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not sure. We will come to court again this Friday. I wish to tell the judge of the divorce case that I would like to see the results of the divorce case come out sooner.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	How about this, the court will send a social worker to visit both parties. Then they will evaluate the situation of both parties to see if they are fit to take care of the child. The report will be considered by the court to make the decision. But prior to that, I would like to ask if you consider…a shared custody? Shared custody entails that the child for a period of time stays with the father, and another period stays with the mother.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人比較不偏好這個選擇，因為我的女兒年紀還太小。她只有八個月大。不希望她承受…這樣子的變化。對一個年紀這麼小的孩子來說，她會感到太困惑了，如果她有一段時間與一個人同住，然後另一段時間又搬去另一個地方。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	On this, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young. It is not suitable to…for shared custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	OK, after that, let’s consider the social worker…visit. After they have devised a report, we will plan a date to come to court to give both of you an opportunity to elaborate on your decisions.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	好，沒問題。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I have no problem with the decision either, thank you.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today, we’re here for the preparatory procedure between Madam Shih Tsai Yun and Ferry Johnson. Have both of you asked for a lawyer?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I have asked a lawyer to help me.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有請。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today, the judge here wants to know more about the perspective of each party about child rearing. The judge also wants to know why both of you consider yourselves the most appropriate one to rear this child, so please elaborate this point, do you understand? In addition, I know that both of you are trying to get a divorce. Therefore, I do not wish to see that both of you have a verbal attack against each other. Do you understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	好，是的。

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Okay.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Okay now, I have some questions to ask the plaintiff. Please tell me the reasons why you wish to rear your child. According the information I’ve received, you do not have a full-time job in Taiwan, and you’re a foreigner, so why do you consider yourself the most appropriate person to have child custody?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	現在有兩個原因去支持為什麼我比較適任於擁有子女撫養權。首先，我已經沒有和太太住在一起了，我想看著孩子長大。而且我還聽說我的太太和別的男人住在一起了。若是這樣的話，她應該不會給予我女兒真正應得的關愛。因此，我適任得到全部的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	So do you mean that now, you’re preparing for a divorce, and your wife is no longer living with you, and you suspect her of living with another guy. Due to the situation like this, you do not wish to let her take care of the child, is that so? 

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是啊，這就是我主要的原因。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Okay, then if…umm..according to your financial status, and if you really do receive the sole custody, then how are you planning to take care of the child?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在確實沒有全職工作。但是，我好幾個間質的工作，因此，我有固定的收入。這些收入足以養活我自己和我的女兒。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You’ve just mentioned about that you have several part-time jobs. Due to they are part-time jobs in their nature, can you tell me an estimated income per month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	平均來說，我有四到五份兼職工作。總共來說，我每個月會賺進五萬台幣。若我有找到其他工作的話，我的收入會高於五萬。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Another question that I would like to ask you is once you receive the child custody, is it possible that you would just take the child to Canada and never come back? The reason why I asked you this is that even of you receive the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. So if you do this, if you just take the child to Canada with you, then it means that you just cut the ties between your daughter and your wife. So, according to this problem, what would you like to say?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我在台灣已經待了五年了吧。我有居留證號碼，而且我喜歡這個地方。目前為止，我是沒有要離開台灣的打算。而且我有認為我女兒應該要擁有見雙方父母的權利。縱使我和我太太目前正辦理離婚，但是，我不打算要切斷她們之間的關係。在我們辦理離婚手續的過程當中，我常常會將我女兒的照片給我太太看。我甚至會辦一些活動啊，或是約。。。我們大家一起出去。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	 Okay, so you mean that currently, you do not have any plans to return to your mother country?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	恩，不不不，我是有可能回加拿大，因為我母親現在生病啦。但縱使我回去加拿大，我也不會長期待在那裡。我應該也不會想要把我女兒帶那裡。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Okay, now, I would like to ask the other party some questions. Are you still living with your husband or not?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Well, we’re not living together anymore for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you ask for a divorce?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About a month ago, I think.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	Okay, that means before you asked for a divorce, you two have not been living together, right? 

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes, that’s right. 

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So, who are you living with now? What’s the condition now?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with the former husband’s son.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Oh, your former husband….first marriage? Then, how about the husband you have now? 

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	Well, he’s my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	Now, we’re trying to figure out the custody is about the child you have with your second husband. She’s a daughter?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes, that’s right.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	Then how old is your son, and how old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old, and my daughter eight months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	The time when you moved out, your daughter, who did she go with?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	At that time, my daughter was only two months old; therefore, she needs my care, so she stayed with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	And now, who is she staying with?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now, she’s staying with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Did you have any pact between each other? Why does your daughter stayed with you, and then, she’s staying with your husband now? 

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place where I moved out to live is a bit small, and the place where my husband lives is quite large. Therefore, due to the environment and circumstances, I just wished my daughter to live with him. 

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	Okay, so if the objective circumstances do not change, then is your place still not better than your husband’s? Then why did you wish to receive the child’s sole custody?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	Hey, I am the one who bear her for ten months, I can’t live without her. Moreover, my husband is a Canadian, he does not have a fixed income, and he even has the possibility to return to Canada. If so, then I’ll lose the right to visit my daughter. Therefore, I’m here to gain for the custody. 

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	In terms of your financial status, can you describe how you would raise the child?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now, we’re still trying to divorce, and I would like to get the right of living in the place where my husband is now living. Therefore, in terms of the environment there, it would be perfect for my daughter to grow up. As for my current financial status, I have let the court see my asset list. Moreover, I have a very regular income and a very stable job. My monthly income would be no less than forty thousand. Therefore, I believe that I have the ability to take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	Okay, so how is your divorce case going on? Do you know why you will get the verdict, approximately when?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	Well, I’m not sure. We’ll go to the court this Friday again. I would like to ask the court to make a decision of the verdict sooner. 

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	 The court will ask social workers to visit the home of both parties and make an evaluation of each of your ways of taking care of the child. And the court will decide according their report of how you take care of the child. Before this, I would like to ask both parties do you mind of having a shared custody? Shared custody means that the child can stay with her father for a while, and stay with her mother for another while

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	恩，我不太想要耶，因為我女兒還小。她才八個月大。我不想要她一下子陪我，然後一下子又陪我太太。如果是這樣的狀況的話，我的女兒她這麼小，她會覺得很混亂。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	I agree with my husband’s point. My daughter is too young; therefore, shared custody is not the right choice for us. 

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Okay, if so, then we’ll just begin our progress of sending the social workers. And after receiving their report, we’ll set up a time to open the court again. Therefore, you two will have the chance of making a statement, okay? 

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	恩，好的，社工人員可以來我家。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I have no problem with that, either, thank you.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today, we are here for the preparation procedure of the child rearing between these two parties. Do both parties hire a lawyer?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I have hired a lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today, the court is to understand the position for these two people in terms of the child rearing. Besides, the court also hopes to know whether you two have the capacity to rear the child. Please elaborate in terms of this point. Besides, we know that you also have the case of divorce about this case. Therefore, we hope that you two will not have verbal attacks with one another and have a quarrel.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	First, the plaintiff, please, why do you want to have the right to rear your child? As the court investigates, you don’t have a formal job in Taiwan. You haven’t had a formal job in Taiwan yet. Beside, you are a foreigner. Why do you think that you have the capacity to take care of your child?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望法院可以判給我全部撫養權，因為兩個原因。首先，我妻子不再跟我一起生活了。我想在這邊看我女兒長大。此外，我還聽說我妻子還跟另外一個男人共處。如果那是真的的話，我就懷疑她是否能撫養我們的女兒。所以我想要有全部的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean that your wife is not under the same roof with you, and you are dealing with the case about divorce. Besides, you are also suspicious about whether she stays with a other man. Is this the very reason for you to have the sole custody?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是，這是我的主要原因。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	About your financial status, if you get the sole custody of your daughter, how do you rear your daughter?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在沒有全職的工作。但是我有許多兼職的工作，讓我有固定的收入。我覺得這些收入已經足夠養活我和我的女兒了。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have some part-time job. Because these jobs are not formal, do you have the whole overview of your regular income? Whether it is fixed?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均有4到5個兼職工作。大約可以讓我賺5萬塊吧。如果我有其他案子的話，收入會更多。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Besides, the court would like to ask another question. Do you plan to bring her back to Canada and do not return to Taiwan after you have the sole custody? The reason for asking this question is that your wife may still have the visitation right after you have the sole custody. If you bring your daughter back to your country, it may evolve into a situation that you cut the tie between your wife and your daughter. About this point, what do you want to say?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我在台灣已經待了5年了。我己經有了居留證號碼，也喜歡這個地方。我沒有任何離開台灣的打算。我認為，其實女兒有可以看我們雙親的權利。我想要強調一點，雖然我們現在打離婚官司，但我沒有要切斷他們兩個聯繫的意圖。在我們打離婚官司的時候，我還寄了不少我女兒的照片給老婆呢。我甚至安排時間能讓我和女兒、還有我的太太一起出遊呢。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	You mean that recently, you don’t have the plan to return to your country.

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	其實我也可能會回加拿大，因為我媽媽很老、很虛弱。如果我回國，也不會待太久，甚至不考慮把我女兒一起拜去加拿大。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Okay, now I’m going to ask the other party. Is that true that you don’t live with your husband?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have been separated for about 6 months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the case about your divorce?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About 2 months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	That is to say, before you file the divorce case, you two have not lived together. Is that true?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So, how is your living situation? I mean that who accompanies you, live with you.

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son with my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? What is the time of marriage with the plaintiff?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	Therefore, you are seeking to the custody of your daughter, who you have with the second husband.

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son with your first marriage?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is 7 years old, and my daughter is about 8 months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	After you move away from your house, you bring your daughter with you?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	Because at that time, my daughter was only 2 months, she still needed my support.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Now, where is your daughter?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	My daughter is living with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Do you two have any agreements with each other because firstly, she lives with you, and now she lives with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The house I’m living after moving out is smaller than the one that I stayed with my husband. In terms of the environment, I think it is better to stay in the original house with my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstance about your house is not better than your husband’s house, it is not good for your daughter, isn’t it? Why do you want to have the right to rear your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I had been pregnant about 10 months for the daughter. How can I just give my daughter to my husband? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian. He don’t have regular jobs and formal jobs, I’m afraid that he will go back to Canada. If that is true, I will not see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I would like to strike to have the right to rear my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	For your financial status, please elaborate how you will take care of your daughter in the future.

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	We are still dealing with the case of our divorce. Now, I’m seeking to win, to have the right to live in the original house, which now my husband is living. Therefore, in terms of the living conditions and environment, the original house is better for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have provided a asset list for my income. Besides, I have a formal job in Taiwan, and the regular payment is 40,000 NT dollars. I think that I have the capacity to take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	How is your divorce case now? Do you have the idea about the exact time to close your divorce case?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not sure. This Friday, we will attend the court about my marriage. I hope that I will ask the court to have their decision faster and earlier.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Okay, the court will arrange social workers to visit you two, and these social workers will evaluate in terms of the circumstances about rearing your daughter. We will make further decision in terms of their observation. However, before that, can have shared custody? Shared custody is that your daughter will stay with your husband a whole and later will spend some time with the mother.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人認為，我不太想要共同扶養權，我女兒還很小，只有8個月大，我不希望她在我跟太太之間送來送去的。對一個只有8個月的小孩來說，一下子跟我住，一下子又跟她媽媽住的話，會讓她十分困擾。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	About this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is still too young. It is not appropriate for her to live with the shared custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Therefore, the court will first arrange social workers to visit with you two parties. After their report and observation, we will further set a court day. Therefore, on that day, you can elaborate further about this case.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	好的，我可以接受社工人員的拜訪。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	Yes, I’m okay as well for this arranging.

en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, I am going to know the position of both of you. I also want to know why both of you think that you can have the sole custody. Please elaborate for this point. Besides, you two are under the divorce procedure. Therefore, please do not have verbal attack with each other. Is this okay?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我知道了

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Plantiff, why do you strive for the child’s sole custody? As far as I am concerned, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan. You are a foreigner. Why do you think that you have the right to have the child’s sole custody.

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	因為以下兩點，所以我想爭取孩子的獨立撫養權第一，我的妻子沒跟我同住，我想看我女兒長大，更何況我聽說我妻子跟另外一個男人住，如果這是真的，我很懷疑她是否能給我們女兒最好的照顧，因此能擁有獨立的撫養權

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean that your wife has no longer lived with you, even if you two are still under the divorce procedure? Moreover, you also suspend she is now living with another man? It is because this situation therefore you do not want to give her the custody?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的，這是我的主要考量

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	How do you plan to take care of your daughter according to your financial status?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我目前的確沒有全職工作，但我有好幾份兼職，也有穩定的收入，我想這收入足夠我養活我的女兒和自己

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because what you did is still the part-time jobs, can you evaluate how much do you earn per month regularly?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	 我平均來說有四五份兼職，總計大概有五萬台幣，有時如果找到新的兼職，我可能還會有額外的收入

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	I want to ask that if you get your daughter’s sole custody, will you go back to Canada and never come back to Taiwan again? The reason why I ask this question is that if you get the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, the situation will be that you separate your daughter with her mom. As for this, what’s your explanation?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了，也有了居留證，而我也很喜歡這裡，目前為止我沒有打算離開台灣，另外，我也覺得我女兒有權利見到父母雙方，我想要強調，儘管我跟我太太正在打離婚官司，但我並不想切斷我女兒的聯繫，在我們打離婚官司的過程中，我也好幾次發我女兒的照片給我太太，我甚至邀請她和我女兒一起出遊

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	You mean that you do not plan to go back to your hometown?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	是的，但我可能會回加拿大，因為我母親年老且生病了，但就算我回去，我也不會待太長時間，我甚至不考慮帶我女兒一起去

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Okay, then I will ask the other side some questions. Now you do not live with your husband, right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we live in different places for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the case for divorce?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	Maybe two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	That is to say, before you two seek for divorce, you did not live your husband?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	Then who do you live now?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	 I live with my son in my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? How about the plantiff?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So you are now striving for the custody of your daughter with the second husband?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	 Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is 7 years old and my daughter is 8 months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, who did your daughter live with?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	My daughter was with because she was only two months old then.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Who is your daughter living with now?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now my daughter is living with my husband. 

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Do you two have an agreement? Why the daughter first with you and now with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place where I live now is much smaller than the house I lived with my husband before. Considering the environment, my husband’s house is better for my daughter.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	Therefore, in objective circumstances, your place is not good for your daughter, right? Then why do you want the custody of your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is the one who I spent ten months to have, how can I live without her? My husband is a Canadian. Besides, his job is not stable. He might go back to Canada anytime. In that case, I cannot see my daughter again. So I want to have my daughter’s sole custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	In the terms of your financial status, can you explain how you are going to rear your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	We are still under the divorce case. I wish the court can let me in my husband’s house. Therefore, as to the environment, that house will be good for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have given the court my current asset list. Besides, I have a regular job and on average, I have NT$40000 per month. Therefore, I am able to take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	I would like to ask that how’s your divorce case? When will the trial procedure be set?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure about that. We have a court this Friday. I hope to ask the judge of my divorce case to have the result quickly.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	The court will send social workers to you and your husband’s houses, then evaluate the situation. The court will make the decision according to the social workers’ report. Before that, I want to ask that will you consider the shared custody? The shared custody is that your daughter will respectively live with mom and dad in a certain period.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人認為這並不適合，因為我女兒還太小，她只有八個月大，我不想她在我和老婆間換來換去，這對我小孩來說，這會造成我小孩的混亂，當他一下跟爸爸，一下跟媽媽的時候

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	At this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young to have the shared custody about rearing together.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Okay, then we will first arrange for the social workers’ visit. After getting the report from the social workers, we will set the court date. Both of you have the right to state your opinions.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我對於社工的探訪沒有問題

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	 I also have no questions, thanks.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today we are here for preparatory procedure for Mr. Johnson and Ms.…. Both parties, do you have your lawyers?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today the judge will want to know your positions of the child rearing. We also want to know why you think you are suitable for rearing this child. Please elaborate it according to this point. I know you are also in the divorce case. So we hope that you could avoid the verbal attack.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	First, I would like to ask some questions for both of you. The plaintiff, why do you want to strive for the child rearing rights? As I know, you do not have full-time job in Taiwan. And your identity is foreigner. For this situation, why do you think you are more suitable?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	考量這2個原因，我希望能將全部撫養權判給我。第一，我的妻子沒有跟我一起住了。我想要看到我小孩長大。此外，我也聽說我的太太現在跟另外一個男人一起住。如果是這樣的話，我很懷疑他能給小孩一個好的成長環境嗎？所以我希望我能擁有全部的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	So you mean that your wife is in the divorce case with you, but she does not live with you now? And you doubt that she lives with other man. It is this situation that makes you unwilling to make your children taken care of by her?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的，這就是我主要的考量緣故

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	For your financial status concerns, if you get sole custody, how will you raise your daughter?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	的確，我現在沒有全職工作，但是我現在有兼好幾份打工，足以付足…。我想這些收入足夠撫養我的女兒。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because they are all part-time jobs, could you evaluate how much regular income you will get?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我大概有4到5份的兼職工作。那這樣算起來的話，每個月我大概可以有5萬元的收入，此外我如果還有多一些工作的話，也許收入會增加。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	I have another question. If you have the custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and will not come back to Taiwan? I ask this is because that even if you get the custody, your wife still has the visitation rights. If you take your child back to your country, it means that you cut the tie between the mother and the daughter. What’s your idea about this?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我在台灣已經待5年了，我有居留證號碼，而且我非常喜歡這個地方。目前為止，我沒有要離開台灣的打算。我也覺得我的小孩有需要見到父母。我要強調，雖然我跟我太太現在在打離婚官司，但我從來沒想過要切斷他與我女兒的聯繫。在打離婚官司的過程中，我有寄我女兒的照片給我太太，我還邀請…

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean in the short term, you do not plan to go back to your country?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	也許吧。因為我母親已經非常老而且生病了。即使我回去了，我也不會留太久。我也沒想過我要把女兒一起帶回去。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Now we want to ask the relative party about some questions. You do not live with your husband?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have not lived together for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	So when do you suit the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So before you suit the divorce case, you do not live together?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So who do you live with now?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son with my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? So what’s the…

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So about the child rearing rights, it’s about the daughter with your second husband?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son? And your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and my daughter is six months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you move out, does your daughter live with you or your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I move out, my daughter was only two months old, and she needs me, so she lived with me then.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	So where did the daughter live with?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now my daughter lives with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there any agreement between your husband and you? Why does your daughter live with your husband instead of you?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	After I move out, the place I live is smaller than the place that my husband lives. For living environment, it will be better for my child, so I let my daughter live with my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So if the objective circumstances, that is, the living environment, does not change, it’s still not good for your daughter, isn’t it? So why do you strive for the custody?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is my daughter, and I cannot see her. My husband is a Canadian, and his job in Taiwan is not so fixed, he may go back to Canada anytime. Then, in that case, I will not see my daughter forever. So I hope I can strive for the rearing rights for my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	For your financial status, how will you afford the raising…?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now we are still in the divorce case. I hope I can strive for the rights that I can live in the house that my husband lives now. So for the living environment, that house will be good for my daughter. As for my financial status, I have offered my asset list for the court. Besides, I have the fixed job, that I can get NT$40000 per month. I believe I can raise and take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	So how is your divorce case? When will the divorce case have the result?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not so sure. We will be in court this Friday. I will express to the judge of the divorce case that the decision can be given as soon as possible.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	So the court will send the social workers to visit both of you, and will make the evaluation for how you interact with your daughter. We will make some decision according to the social workers’ report. Before that, I would like to ask will both of you consider the shared custody? Shared custody means that the daughter will live with the husband sometime and live with mother some time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我並不太贊成這個安排，因為我的女兒還太小，他只有8個月大，我不想讓他在我跟我太太之間傳來傳去的。對一個這麼小的小孩來說，如果讓他跟爸爸住一段時間，又讓他跟媽媽住一段時間，這樣會讓他感到非常混亂。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small, it is not suitable for this arrangement.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Ok, we will go through the process of social workers’ visitation. After they do the report, we will set the next court date. Then we will make both of you have the opportunity to state.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	好，我同意這個安排。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I also agree, too.

en-US	Today my major concern is to clarify your will on child custody. I also concerned with why both of you consider yourself fully capable for the sole custody. Please elaborate your view. Beside the child rearing case, I know you’re also up with a divorce case. So I hope there won’t be any verbal attacks in the court.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我瞭解了

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Let me ask you a few question. Plaintiff, why do you want to get the sole custody of your child? Far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan for the time being. And you’re also a foreigner. In fighting for the child rearing right, why do you think you’re more capable? 

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望能得到我女兒的全部撫養權, 而我有兩個理由. 首先我太太已經沒和我們住在一起了, 我希望能陪伴我女兒成長. 再來我聽說我老婆和另一個男的同居了, 如果這事情是真的, 那我懷疑她可以帶給我們女幸福, 因此我希望能有全部撫養權

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean because your wife is still up with a divorce case with you, but she no longer live with you, is that right? Moreover, you think she’s living with another man. Regarding this situation that’s why you don’t want to share custody with your wife, is that right?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對, 這都是我的考量

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Other than that, concerning your financial status, how are you going to raise your daughter? 

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	確實我現在沒有一份全職的工作, 但是我有兼任好幾份工作並提供我穩定的工作, 我相信我的收入能夠提供我和我女兒足夠的金額

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You mentioned you have several part-time jobs, since all of them are part-time jobs, can you make an evaluation about how much exactly you make each month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	平均來說我大概有四五份兼職工作, 全部加起來的話一個月大概能賺五萬塊有時如果有接到新案子的話可以賺更多錢

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	And another question, after you get the sole custody of your child, will you take her to Canada and do not return? The reason why I’m asking this question that even if you get the sole custody, your wife still have the visitation right. So if you take your daughter back to Canada, it means that you’re cutting the tie between your wife and daughter. What do you think about that?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣住了五年, 我有這邊的居留權, 我也很喜歡這邊, 目前我並沒有離開台灣的計畫, 特別是我相信我女兒應該有權力能見到她的父母, 我要強調的是雖然我和我太太在打離婚官司, 但我並沒有打算切斷她們母女倆的聯繫, 在離婚官司的過程中我都會寄女兒的照片給她, 我甚至會安排時間為我們大家見面. 

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	You mean you don’t have any plan to return to Canada at the moment?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	不, 我回加拿大的原因只有可能是我媽老了病了. 就算如此我回去也不會停留太久, 我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒一起去

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Now I’m going to ask your wife some questions. You no longer live with your husband is that true?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes we’ve been parting for six months already.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	So when did you file the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	Well, about two month ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So that means, before you file the divorce, you no longer live together right?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So what is your living condition at the moment? Who do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I’m living with my son from my first marriage. 

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? So what marriage are we talking here?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He’s my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So the child rearing case is about your second child, which is your daughter

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son, and how old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	After you move out, did your daughter live with you or your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	After I moved out, my daughter was just two months old, so she still needs me, and live with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	What about now? Who does the child live with

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now my daughter lives with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Did you have any agreement? Why did she live with you at first, and now with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	After I move out, I live in a smaller place, so my husband has a bigger place. The environment is better, so I think she’s better off with my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	Regardless of the objective circumstances, that’s still not…. Is that better for your daughter? So why do you want to get the sole custody of your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	After all, I’ve had her pregnant for ten months, she’s still my daughter. Besides, my husband is Canadian, and he doesn’t hold a stable job. In this concern, I may never see my daughter again. That’s why I want to get my daughter’s sole custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	As for your financial status, can you elaborate how are you going to raise your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	So far, we’re still up with the divorce case. I’m fighting for the right to live in my husband’s place after the divorce case. Based on the environment, I think my husband’s place would be suitable for my daughter’s growing up. As for my financial status, I’ve provided an asset list for the court. And I also have a job with an income of 40000 NT a month. So I think I’m capable of raising my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	So may I ask how is your divorce case proceeding? Do you know when will the court’s decision be made?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not sure, we will be in another court this Friday. I will ask the judge of the divorce case to come up with a court decision as soon as possible.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	How about we send a social worker to see both of you? So the social worker will make an evaluation based on how you interact with your daughter. We will take that evaluation as reference to see what works the best for your daughter. But before that, have you come to think about share custody? Basically, share custody is to have your daughter spend a certain amount of time with her father, and a certain amount of time with her mother.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人是不太贊同這種作法, 因為我女兒還太小, 她才八個月大, 我不希望她經歷我和我太太之間的流離失所, 對這麼小的小孩來說, 讓她以這種方式長大的話她會很困惑

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	On this point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too little, she’s not suitable for a share custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Ok, if that’s the case, we’ll first arrange a social worker to see how it goes. After there’s a result, we’ll arrange the next court time. And that both parties have the chance to elaborate.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	Ok, 我接受先讓社工來訪

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I’m fine with that too.

en-US	5th floor, No.414, Sec. 3, Zhong-Chen Road, Shilin Dist., Taipei City

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today, we are going to have a preparatory procedure for child custody of Mr. Ferry Johnson and Ms.史彩雲.Do you both have lawyers?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有一個律師。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today, we are going to understand your attitudes towards child custody.And the court also wants why you both think that you have the right to take care of this child.So please elaborate this point particularly.Besides, I know that you are now engaged in a divorce case.So please avoid any verbal attack, please.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	So first, I would like to ask the plaintiff some questions.The plaintiff, why do you want to be granted your child custody.As the court knows, you do not have a full-time job here in Taiwan.And you are a foreigner.On child custody, why do you think you have more custody than the other party?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我想要得到我女兒的單獨撫養權有兩個原因。第一，我的太太不再跟我住在一起了。我希望我可以陪我女兒長大。而且我聽到，我太太和別的男人同居。如果真的是這樣的話，我很懷疑他是否可以提供我女兒應得的照顧。所以我想要爭取撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you are now engaged in a divorce case and you are no longer living together?And you doubt that your wife is living with another man.Because of the above-mentioned circumstances, you are unwilling to give your daughter to your wife, right?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的，這就是我最擔心的原因。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	And regarding your financial status, if you are granted with your child’s sole custody, how can you take care of your daughter?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在的確沒有全職的工作。但是我有好幾份兼差，也是有固定收入的。我相信這些固定的收入可以讓我和我女兒好好地生活。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs at present.Because these jobs are just part-time, can you approximately estimate how much income is regularly?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均都會有四五個兼差工作。所以我一個月大概都會有五萬塊台幣的收入。如果我有得到更多案子的話，我的收入就會增加。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Is it possible that if you are granted with your child’s custody, you will go back to Canada and never come back again?The reason the courts asks so, even you are granted with the child custody, your wife can be granted with visitation right.If you brought your child back to Canada, it also made your daughter cut the tie with the mother. What’s your opinion to point?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣住五年了。我得到了居留證，也很喜歡這裡。目前並沒有離開台灣的計劃。尤其我覺得我女兒應該要有見到他雙親的權利。我想要強調的是，雖然我和我太太正在打離婚官司，但我並沒有想要我女兒和我太太切斷聯繫。即使在我們的離婚訴訟進行中，我也是固定有寄我女兒的照片給我太太。我甚至安排了一些時間，邀請我太太和我女兒一起度過一些時光。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that in a short time, you are not intended to go back to your homeland, right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	是的，目前沒有這個計畫，但如果有一天我媽媽老了又生病的話。即使我回去，應該也不會待很久。我甚至也不會考慮帶我女兒一起回去。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Now, the court would like to ask the defendant some questions. Are you no longer staying with your husband.

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have been no longer living together for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	I filed the case around two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So, before you filed the divorce, you hadn’t lived with your husband for a long time. 

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	What is your current living circumstances? I mean who are you living with now

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	Now, I am living with my son of my ex-husband?

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? So which marriage is it with the plaintiff.

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	Now, the child custody we are here for is between the second husband, for the daughter?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	And how old is your son, and how old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight-month old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, was your daughter left by your husband or you brought her with you?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I moved out, my daughter was only two-month old; therefore, I brought her with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	And where is the child now?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now, my daughter is living with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there an agreement between you? Why you brought your daughter with you, and she is now with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	After I moved out, I found an apartment which is smaller than the place my husband is living. Taking living circumstances into consideration, my husband’s place is better than mine.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstances remain the same, that is, your living environment, this is not better for your daughter, right? Why do you want to be granted with your child’s custody?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I gave birth to my daughter, so how could I be separated from her? And my husband is a Canadian, and he does not have a stable job here. He may go back to Canada at any time. If that is the case, I will never my daughter again. Therefore, I hope to be granted with my daughter’s custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	As to your financial status, how could you afford your daughter’s spending?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now, we are still engaged in a divorce case. So, I would like to ask to live in the apartment my husband lives now after our divorce. Based on the living environment, the apartment will be suitable for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have provided my asset list to the court. Besides, I have stable job, my regular income is at least 40000 NT dollars per month. So, I think I have the ability to rear my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	And how is your divorce case going? Do you know the estimated date that the court’s decision comes out?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure. We have another court this Friday. I would like to ask the judge of the divorce case to give the court’s decision as soon as possible.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	So, the court will arrange some social workers to visit both of your places, the plaintiff and the defendant. And evaluate your relations with your daughter from your both sides. The court will take the social worker’s evaluation into consideration to give the court’s decision to make sure what is suitable for the child. Before that, the court would like to make sure that have you ever considered to share the custody? The shared custody means the child will live with the father for some time, and live with the mother for some time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人不太考慮這一點，因為我女兒還太小。他只有八個月大而已。我不想要他跟經歷我和太太的離異過程。對一個那麼小的小孩來講，可能會造成他認知上的混淆，如果他必須跟他的父親住一段時間，又再去跟母親住一段時間的話。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	As to this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young to arrange this way at such a young age.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	If that is the case, we will schedule first the visits of the social workers. After they finish their evaluation, we will schedule our next court date. So, the both parties have the chance to state your opinions. Is that all right?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	是的，我接受社工來訪。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I have no problems, too. Thank you.

en-US	Yes, I have a lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有律師。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today what I mainly want to do is to understand what is your standpoint on your child custody, and I would also like to know why you think you are the more appropriate one to rear the child. Please focus on this point and elaborate. In addition, I know you are also filing for a divorce case, so I hope that won’t make any verbal attack each other. Is that OK with you?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我知道了。

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	OK, I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	First, I would like to ask the plaintiff some questions. Why would you like to…why would you like your child’s custody? As far as I am concerned, now in Taiwan you don’t have a full-time job. You are a foreigner. On the matter of child custody, why do you think you are the more appropriate person?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我主要…我想要就是全部的小孩撫養權有兩個原因。首先，我的太太沒有再跟我們一起住了，我想要在那裡看我女兒長大，而且我聽說我太太跟另外一個男人住在一起。如果是那樣子的話，我懷疑她到底能不能給我們的小孩最好的照顧。因此，我希望有全部的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	What you mean is that although your wife is still going on a divorce case with you, she no longer lives with you, and you also doubt that she lives with another man. So…because of the…based on the above reasons, you don’t want the child to be raised by her, is that right?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對，這是我主要的顧慮。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	As to your financial status, that is to say, if you don’t have a full-time job, how are you going to raise your child…your daughter?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在確實是沒有全職的工作，但是我有幾個…幾個工作，收入也很固定。這個固定收入可以讓我照顧我自己跟我的女兒。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just said that you have several part-time jobs. Because all of them are part-time jobs, can you estimate how much income you have each month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均來說有四到五份兼職工作，全部加起來的話，每個月大概有五萬多塊台幣，如果我有其他額外的工作的話，收入可能會更多。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Another thing I want to ask is that, is it possible that after you get your child’s custody, you will take her to Canada and not coming back? The reason I ask is that although you get your custody, your wife still have the visitation right, and she can regularly visit your daughter. If you bring your daughter back to Canada, you will be indirectly cutting the tie between them…between your wife and your daughter. So…about this, what is your opinion?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我在台灣已經待五年了。我有居留證，而且我蠻喜歡…我很喜歡這裡。我目前沒有離開台灣的打算，而且我覺得小孩有權利見他的父母。我想說的是，就算我現在要跟我老婆離婚，我沒有打算要切斷我女兒和我老婆的聯繫。在打離婚官司的期間，我…就是定期會傳女兒的照片給老婆看。我甚至還會…就是安排一起出去玩，讓老婆也可以看看小孩。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So what you’re saying that so far you don’t have a plan…to go back to Canada, right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	對，我有可能會回去，但只是因為我媽年紀大了或生病之類的，但是就算我回去，我也不會待太久。我根本就不會想要把女兒一起帶去。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Now I would like to ask the other party some questions. Do you no longer live with your husband now?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have been separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you…when did you file your divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	That is to say, before you filed your divorce case, you longer live together, right?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So who do you live with now?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son, who is the child of my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? So…this time…

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So the custody we’re not talking about is…with your husband and is a daughter…your daughter.

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	So how old is your son? How old is your daughter.

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old, and my daughter is five months old…eight months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you are…separate with your husband, is your daughter with you or with your husband…was.

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When…because at that time my daughter was only two months old, she needed my care, so I took her with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	So where is…where is the child now? Is she with you or with your husband?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now my daughter is with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Did you have some sort of negotiation before? Why is your…why was her with you a few months ago, and now she is with your husband.

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	After I moved out, my house was smaller. The one I lived with my husband is bigger. Because the environment is better, I sent my daughter to my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So…if the objective circumstances are not changed...your living place, the environment is still better for your daughter, right? So why do you want your child’s custody, then?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is my daughter who I spent ten months bearing…ten months…how would I bear not seeing her? And my husband is Canadian. He’s work in Taiwan is not very stable. He will possibly go back to Canada at any time. In that case, I wouldn’t see my daughter anymore, right? So I would like to…so I would like to have my daughter’s custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Based on your financial status…can you…can you tell us how you are going to rear your child?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now we are still going on the divorce case. I hope that now we can let our daughter live in my husband’s house now. Based…in concerned of the environment, the house is better for my daughter to grow up. As to my financial status, I have give…I have gave…I have given the court my asset list. In addition, I also have a full-time job, I income every month is 40,000 dollars. I think I am capable of raising my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	How is your divorce case going on now? Do you know when…when…when we will see the result, or about when we will see the result of the divorce case?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not quite sure. We will go on the court for the divorce case on this Friday again. I hope that I can tell the judge of the divorce case that the sentence be granted as soon as possible.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Maybe…we will ask a social worker to regularly visit the plaintiff and the other party and make some evaluation based on seeing your relationship between you and your daughter. The court will…will take reference of their reports and see which party is better of raising the child. Before that, I would like to ask if you both…are you willing to have shared custody? That means that your daughter will be living with husband…with her father for a while and with her mother for another time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我目前不是很同意這個決…這個方法。他才八個月大而已，我不想她在我跟我老婆之間這樣來來回回的。對一個年紀這麼小的小孩而言，一段時間跟爸爸住，一段時間跟媽媽住，這樣對她來說會很混亂。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	On this issue, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too small for…to young for shared custody...to be raising by shared custody…to be raised custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	So, if that is the case, we will arrange for social worker’s visit. After we read their reports, we will arrange our next trial to let both of you state your standpoint. Is that OK with you?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	嗯，我覺得社工探視可以。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I don’t have any questions…It’s also OK with you…with me.

zh-TW	請問你此行出發地為何？
en-US	So where are you from?

en-US	I departed from Bangkok, Thailand.
zh-TW	我從泰國出境....泰國曼谷出發

zh-TW	你在幾月幾日搭乘飛機？飛機航班為何？途中有無轉機?
en-US	So when do you take the plan? what’s your flight number? did you transfer?

en-US	I don’t remember my flight number. I took the plane about six thirty AM.
zh-TW	我記得我的航班是在2012年的十二月五號。我已經忘記我是...航班號碼 我只記得當時我是搭乘國泰航空 然後六點三十的飛機。我在香港轉機，然後待轉機的時間大概是一個小時又二十分鐘左右

zh-TW	你所帶的高爾夫球袋，是隨身行李還是託運行李？
en-US	So..your golf bag…is it  carrying on luggage or check in luggage

en-US	It was my carry-on.
zh-TW	喔那是我的隨身行李

zh-TW	你知道高爾夫球袋中，有幾根桿子嗎？
en-US	So do you know how many golf clubs in your clubs bag?

en-US	I don’t know a few, maybe.
zh-TW	我不知道...大概有好幾隻吧？

zh-TW	那你知道球桿中藏有毒品嗎？
en-US	So do you know there are narcotics in your clubs?

en-US	No, I don't.
zh-TW	我不知道阿...我就是以為我拿的是高爾夫球竿而已

zh-TW	這高爾夫球袋是誰給你的？在哪裡給你的？
en-US	Who gave you this golf bag?Where did he give you?

en-US	The name of the guy who gave me the bag was Kent. I met him in Bangkok and he hired me to work for him. I am a computer engineer. He gave me this one ball bag at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	這個高爾夫球袋是一個叫肯特的人給我的他在曼谷工作，然後他那個時候雇用我，我就幫他做事。我是跟電腦工程師，然後他在那邊的肯德基給我這個袋子。        

zh-TW	給你高爾夫球袋、要你把它帶入台灣的人是誰？ 你認識他嗎？知道對方的姓名嗎? 
en-US	And who is that person who give you the golf bag and told you to take it to Taiwan?Do you know his or her…his or her name?

en-US	I only know him as Kent, we met earlier in March 2013.
zh-TW	我知道他叫肯特，我們之前再2013年三月的時候有碰過一次面

zh-TW	Kent是對方的姓、還是名？這是他的真名嗎？
en-US	Kant…is this his first name or last name? Is this his real name?

en-US	I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.
zh-TW	我想這是他的真名，但我不知道他的姓是什麼。

zh-TW	他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？
en-US	Where did he give you this golf bag?

en-US	He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	他叫我在曼谷的一家肯得雞等他

zh-TW	你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
en-US	So why did you help him to take the golf bag to taiwan

en-US	He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
zh-TW	他說他會給我美金一千塊作為江高爾夫球帶帶來的酬勞。我想要賺一點小錢，我想說這是一個很簡單的工作。

zh-TW	你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
en-US	You mean that this person give you one thousand us dollar as compensation for you if you bring the golf bag to taiwan, right?

en-US	Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
zh-TW	對他跟我說我只要把袋子帶來台灣就好，然後我其他也不用做任何事情

zh-TW	對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
en-US	Did that  person told you that after you come to Taiwan, what’s the next steps? i mean is there anyone who will get into contact with you?

en-US	Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
zh-TW	肯特叫我說我就在附近的旅館裡面到處住，然後之後會有人打電話給我。

zh-TW	你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
en-US	The cell phone you just answer, is that cell phone is the confiscate in the tauyuan international airport

en-US	Yes, a Nokia phone.
zh-TW	對就是那隻nokia 的手機

zh-TW	提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
en-US	Ok please see the investigatory file, the ….first one, is that the cell phone you just mentioned?

en-US	Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	對這是他給我的

zh-TW	請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
en-US	Is this your personal cell phone?

en-US	No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
zh-TW	不是這不是我的手機。這隻手機是肯特的，他把sim卡插進那隻手機裡面然後交給我。

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	You mean that the cell phone is given by the people who give you the golf bag?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	對他在肯德基把這隻手機給我的

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	So when did he give you the cell phone? did he give you anything else?

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷的前一天把手機交給我。除了手機之外，他還給我400塊美金供我在旅館的吃住

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	So what is the purpose of the cell phone which he gave you?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他說他會透過這隻手機跟我聯絡

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	So you mean that after you arrive to Taiwan, there will be someone who get contact with you,and then meet you and take the golf bag, right?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	對，肯特跟我說在我入境後不久，就會有人跟我聯絡並拿走高爾夫球袋

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	So do you know who will get contact with you？

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不，我不知道誰會打給我

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	You just mention that beside the golf bag and the cell phone,he also  give you 400 us dollars. Is this monetary compensation too?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我想這些錢應該是用來支付我旅館的開

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	Beside these 400 dollars, after you go back to Tailand, you will get another 1000 us dollar,right? is that what you mean?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	對這是我的認知。在我把這個高爾夫球袋交給別人之後，我就會回到泰國，然後得到這1000塊美金的酬勞

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	Before you accept this please, did you know it was heroine?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不我完全不知道，我不知道毒品藏在高爾夫球袋裡面。

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don’t you doubt that he just send you to bring the gold to Taiwan.  And this monetary compensation, which this 1000 us dollars, isn’t that little bit high?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我是不知道這代價是否太高，我只知道這些錢很好賺。

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Have you ever wonder why don’t that person just bring the golf bag by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	肯特說他很忙碌，他需要有個人來幫他。

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even though you know what you bring is gold, you should know that bring the gold might be illegal , isn’t it?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我知道黃金在曼谷其實算是便宜了，但我不知道把黃金帶來台灣是不是合法的。

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why don’t you think that there will be no problem to bring the gold to Taiwan?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就是黃金，它應該不會帶來任何麻煩吧？

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	Did you check the bag before you take the golf bag?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	不我沒有，因為那個袋子是密封的。我不覺得我應該要把它打開。

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	So you trust him, and you don’t think you will be conned.

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我在三月的時候遇到肯特，我想那個時候我會為他工作，甚至跟他合作。他看起來是好人，我也不覺得他會騙我。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	You mean that Kant seem to be cooperate with you ,so you trust him, right?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對我以為我們會一起當工作伙伴，所以我信任他。

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	Do you have anything to add beside what you just mentioned?Is there any evidence that you want to ask court to help you investigate.

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我對整件事情感到很抱歉。我不知道那個袋子裡有什麼東西。如果我知道裡面是海落英的話，我是絕對不會把它帶來台灣的。

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	Except for Kant, do you have any more concrete information that may help the police to help you to find who gave you the bag?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我就只有他那隻手機而已。

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	Now you are in the time of detention, do you have any person who you want us to inform?

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.

en-US	You mean this cellphone was given by the one who asked you to carry the golf bag?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	對 他就是在肯德基給我這支手機的

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	Then when did he give you the cellphone? Other than the cellphone, did he give you any other things?

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我這支手機,除了手機之外他還給我美金四百元來付旅館及吃飯的費用

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	What’s the purpose that he gave you the cellphone?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他說他會透過這支手機跟我聯絡 還有要來拿這個高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這支手機跟我聯絡

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	That is, when you bring this cellphone to Taiwan, there will be somebody contact you and make an appointment with you to take the golf bag, right?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	對阿 肯特跟我說我來台灣之後會有人打給我

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	Then did you know who would contact you?

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	沒有耶 我不知道誰會打給我

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	You’ve mentioned that other than the cellphone, Kent also gave you 400 us dollar, was that part of the monetary compensation?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我覺得這筆錢應該是用來支付我的旅館還有吃飯的費用而已

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	So you mean besides the 400 us dollar, after you successfully go back to Thailand, you will get another 1000 us dollar, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.

en-US	So when you took this job, did you know what you carried is heroine?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不不不  我完全不知道球桿裡面有藏海洛因

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don’t you think if he just asked you to bring gold to Taiwan, the monetary compensation, that is 1000 us dollar, is a little bit high

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我也不知道這個酬勞有沒有太高/ 我就想多賺一點錢啊

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Then did you wonder why that guy wouldn’t bring it by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	他跟我說他很忙 需要有人幫他

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even though what really in the golf bag was gold, you should have known that carrying gold into Taiwan may violate the law, isn’t it?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我只知道黃金在泰國比較便宜 可是我不知道帶來台灣會犯法耶

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why would you think it’s okay to bring gold to Taiwan?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	就只是黃金阿 也不會有什麼大問題吧

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	Did you check the thing inside when you get this bag?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	沒有耶 因為袋子封起來了 我不覺得打開他是洽當的

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	So you trust Kent that much, don’t you think you may be conned?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我在三月遇到肯特 那個時候我可能會替他工作 我們也可能會成為夥伴  他看起來人很好啊 我不覺得他會騙我

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	You mean Kent wanted to cooperate in business you so you trust him?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對阿 我就覺得我們會一起工作  所以我才這麼相信他

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	So other than the question you have answered, is there anything you want to state? Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我真的感到很抱歉 我不知道袋子裡面有什麼 他們跟我說是黃金阿 如果我當時知道是海洛因的話 我絕對不會把他帶到台灣的  拜託啦 原諒我

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that after you enter Taiwan and bring this cell phone, there will be someone call you through this phone and meet you to get the golf bag.

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	對，肯特說當我抵達台灣之後，有人會跟我聯絡，然後拿走這個袋子。

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	Do you know who will contact you?

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不，我不知道誰會聯絡

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	As you said, the one hired you to do so, he not only gave you the phone but also four hundred. Was it the compensation?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我想那些錢是要讓我付旅館和食物的費用。

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	Apart from the four hundred dollars, after you successfully arrived Thailand, you would also get one thousand US dollars. Is this what you mean?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	這是我自己理解的。在我把袋子帶到台灣再交給聯絡人之後，我會立刻回去泰國，然後我就能拿到我的一千塊美金。

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	When you accepted this case, did you know that you were going to bring heroine.

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不不不我不知道我不知道我要帶的東西是海洛因。

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don’t you think that if he asks you to bring the gold to Taiwan and he pays you one thousand US dollars. Don’t you feel the price might be a little bit too higher?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我不知道這錢是不是太高，我只是想要賺點外快。

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Have you ever thought that why doesn’t that person bring the golf bag by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	肯特跟我說他很忙，他需要別人來幫他。

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even if there were the gold in the golf bag, you should know that bringing the gold to Taiwan might also violate the law, doesn’t it?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我知道在泰國黃金比較便宜，但是我不知道，我不確定攜帶黃金入境是否違法。

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	How do you think there will be not any problem if you bring gold to Taiwan?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就是黃金啊， 應該沒什麼大問題吧，會嗎?

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	When you took the bag, did you check the thing inside it?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	喔我沒有檢查，因為袋子是密封的。而且我不確定我是不是能檢查一下。

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	You trust him, don’t you think that you might be cheated?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我在三月時遇到肯特，那時我就在幫他工作了，我在想也許我們可以成為很好的夥伴。他看起來是個好人，我不相信不覺得他會騙我。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	Did Kent express any thoughts that he might want to cooperate with you? And this is the reason why you trusted him so much?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對，我想我們會一起合作所以我們才這麼信任他。

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	Apart from the statements which you made before, is there anything else you want to add? Is there anything you want to court to investigate? 

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	  我很抱歉發生這樣的事，我不知道袋子裡藏的是什麼。我不知道裡面裝的是什麼，如果我知道是海洛因，我才不會有這個心，故意它帶進來台灣。請你原諒我。

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	Apart from Kent, do you have any other details which might be more helpful or more concrete, and this kind of information will help the police to know who is the one hire you.

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有他給我的那支手機。

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	Now, you are in the detention. Is there anyone you want us to inform for you?

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
zh-TW	可不可以幫我聯絡我在曼谷的朋友和在英國的小孩呢? 他們一定很擔心我，我原本應該在12月底左右回到泰國。

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	 Next time, we will be here for the trail procedure. You have the right to hire lawyer. After you hire the lawyer, he or she can meet you and understand your case. Do you understand? If this is necessary, your lawyer can contact your families. Do you understand?

zh-TW	我想這應該是他的姓，但我不知道她叫什麼名字。

zh-TW	他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？
en-US	Where did he give this bag?

en-US	He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	他說在曼谷的肯德基裡面

zh-TW	你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
en-US	Why did you take this golf bag to Taiwan for him?

en-US	He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
zh-TW	他答應我事成之後會給我一千美金當作酬勞，我就想賺錢，我覺得這是一個簡單的差事

zh-TW	你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that he promised to give you one thousand dollars as monetary compensation and the job is take the bag to Taiwan, Right?

en-US	Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
zh-TW	是的，她告訴我只要把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣就可以，其他什麼都不用做

zh-TW	對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
en-US	Did he tell you what will happen when you arrive in Taiwan? What I try to say is that did anyone will contact you?

en-US	Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
zh-TW	 Kent 叫我待在某個飯店，會有人從他給我的手機打電話給我接洽，

zh-TW	你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
en-US	The cell phone you just mention is the cell phone which was caught by police in Taoyuan International Airport.

en-US	Yes, a Nokia phone.
zh-TW	是的，就是那隻諾基亞的手機

zh-TW	提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
en-US	 Please look at the evidence one, do you mean the cell phonies the cell phone you mention?

en-US	Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	那就是Kent給我的那支手機

zh-TW	請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
en-US	 Is this your personal cell phone?

en-US	No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
zh-TW	不是不是，這不是我的手機，這是Kent的，他把SIM卡放進去之後就給我了。

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the cell phone was given by the person who ask you to take the golf bag, right?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	是的，他在肯德基給我這支手機

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	 Do you remember the date he gave the cell phone? Besides cell phone, what else did he give to you?

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	在離開曼谷的前一天，他給我這支手機，除了手機，他還給我400美金當作住宿和飲食的費用。

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	 What the intention he gave you the cell phone?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	 他告訴我會用這支手機和我連絡，此外，要拿袋子的人也會打這支手機和我連絡。

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	In other words, if you take this cell phone to Taiwan, somebody will contact you and met you to take the bag?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	是的，肯特告訴我，當我入境台灣，就會有人打這手機和我聯絡拿袋子。

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	Do you who will contact you?

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	 我不知道誰會和我聯繫

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	Besides the cell phone, you also mention four hundred US dollars. Is this also the monetary compensation?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我想這400只是支付我住宿和吃飯的錢

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	Besides four hundred dollars, when you return to Thailand successfully, you will also get one thousand dollars, right?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	我的理解是這樣，當我把袋子給在台灣接應的人之後，回泰國就會拿到1000美金

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	When you received the task, you know the bag you take is heroine, right?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	 我一點也不知道袋子裡面藏有海洛因

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don’t you think that if someone ask you to take gold to Taiwan, and the price is 1000 US dollars, the price is a little high?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我不知道這樣行情是否有點高，但我只想賺點小外快。

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Have you ever wonder that why he came to here by person?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	Kent跟我說他很忙，他需要另一個人來做這件事

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	 Even if there were real gold in this bag, you have to know that taking gold to Taiwan may break the law, isn’t?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我知道在泰國黃金價格不是很高，但是我不知道帶黃金入境是否合法

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	What you think taking the gold would be not a problem?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就只是黃金，應該不會有太大問題

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	Have you check the content in the bag?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	我沒打開檢查，因為是密封的，我不覺得打開是正確的

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	 You just trust the person, don’t you think you would be cheated?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我在2013年三月十見過他，我覺得我們有機會成為生意夥伴，所以才接下這份差事，我覺得他是好人，應該不會騙我。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the person tries to cooperate with you and you just trust him without doubts?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	是的，我覺得我會和他一起合作，所以我才相信他。

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	Besides the statement you mention, anything to add? Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我對這件事感到抱歉，真的不知道袋子裡面有什麼，我以為袋子裡面是黃金，知道裡面是海洛因的話，我就不會答應，我對我的行為感到抱歉。

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	Besides the person you mention named Kent, do you have more concrete information may help the police to investigate the person asking you to take the bag?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有他給我的那支電話

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	So far you are in detention, do you want to inform someone?

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
zh-TW	請你可以聯絡我在曼谷的家人或是英格蘭的孩子。我想他們應該替我擔心，十二月底就要回曼谷。

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	Next time would be judge procedure, you can hire the lawyer. Once you make the decision, the lawyer can have interview with you and understand the case, do you fully understand? If necessary, your lawyer can contact with your family. Do you understand?

en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	The gulf bag you brought was carry on or carry-in(checked-in) luggage?

en-US	It was my carry-on.
zh-TW	是我的隨身行李。

en-US	The name of the guy who gave me the bag was Kent. I met him in Bangkok and he hired me to work for him. I am a computer engineer. He gave me this one ball bag at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	是一個叫做坎特的人交給我的。我在曼谷遇到他的。然後他付錢給我，讓我為他工作。我是一個電腦工程師，然後這個袋子是他在泰國的肯德基交給我的。

zh-TW	你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
en-US	Did you say that Kent asked you to bring this gulf bag to Taiwan and he promised you to pay you $1000USD for monetary compensation, right?

en-US	Yes, a Nokia phone.
zh-TW	是的，那是一支諾基亞的手機。

zh-TW	請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
en-US	Is this your personal cellphone?

en-US	No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
zh-TW	不，這不是「我的」手機。這是肯特給我的啊，他在裡面放入了SIM卡然後再交給我。

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that this cellphone was given by the person who asked you to bring the gulf bag?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	對，他在肯德基一起交給我的。

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	When did he give you the cellphone? What’s the date? And besides cellphone, did he give you anything else? 

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我手機的。 除了手機之外，他還給了我400美金當作食住費用。

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	What was his purpose to give you this cellphone?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他說他會透過這支手機聯繫我。有可能要來拿球袋的人也會透過這個手機連絡我吧。

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	That is, if you entered Taiwan, there would be a person calls(calling) you via this phone and asked(asking) to take the gulf bag.

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	是的，肯特告訴我當我抵達台灣的時候會有人跟我拿這個球袋。

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	 Do you know who would get contact with you? 

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不，我不知道誰會聯絡我。

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	You’ve mentioned that in addition to the cellphone, the person gave you $400USD, is this so-called monetary compensation?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我想這筆錢只是我的食宿費用而已。

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	Besides this 400 dollars, when you arrive in Thailand successfully after giving the gulf bag, you will get another 1000 US dollars, right?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	我的理解上是這樣。當我把高爾夫球袋交給別人，回到泰國之後，我就會拿到另外的1000美金。

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	When you receive the bag, do you know there is heroine inside?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不，我完全不知道海洛因就藏在裡面。

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don’t you feel that if the man just asked you to bring the gold in(to) Taiwan, and the monetary compensation, that is $1000 USD, wasn’t this price too high?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	這個價錢到底算不算高我不知道，但是我只是想要賺錢啊。

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Have you thought that why don’t that person just bring the bag by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	他告訴我他很忙啊，所以他需要有人來幫他。

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even if there is gold in the gulf bag, not heroine, but you should know maybe brought(bringing) gold into Taiwan may violate the law, isn’t it?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我知道黃金在泰國比較便宜，但是我並不知道攜帶黃金入境台灣到底違不違法欸。

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why would you think that to bring gold into Taiwan wouldn’t become a problem?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就只是黃金啊。應該不會有甚麼大問題吧？

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	When you picked up the bag, did you check the product inside? 

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	我沒有欸，因為那個袋子被封起來了。我不認為我有這個權利打開它。

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	Why did you trust him so much? Don’t you think that you might be cheated? 

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	因為我在三月的時候就已經遇到他啦，他那時候還要聘請我幫他工作，所以我本來還有可能是他員工的。他感覺人很好啊，不想是會說謊的樣子。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that the person had also showed his will to cooperate with you to do some business, so you don’t doubt him?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對，我想我們本來是會一起工作，所以我才很信任他。

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	Besides the statement you have made, is there anything else you want to add? Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate to help you with your case?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我真的對於事情的發生感到很抱歉。我真的不知道袋子裡裝甚麼。如果我知道袋子裡是海洛因的話我就不會帶來台灣了。請原諒我。

en-US	 Beside(s) Kent this name, do you have further concrete information that can help the police to know who is the person that asked you to bring the bag?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有他給我的那支手機。

zh-TW	你可以幫我聯絡在曼谷的家人或在英國的小孩嗎？他們應該很擔心我吧，因為我本來該在12月底回到泰國的。

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我沒想過這個

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Have you ever wondered that why the person did not bring it by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	我不知道，我只是想賺點錢

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	If what in the golf bag was really gold, you should know bringing gold in to another country can be illegal, don’t you think so?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我沒想那麼多，只是帶黃金而已

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？

zh-TW	黃金就只是黃金而已呀

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	Did you check what is in the bag, when you took it?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	沒有，因為他交給我的時候袋子是密封的，我覺得我應該不能打開它

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	You trusted him. You didn’t feel that he might con you

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我在三月的時候就認識肯特了，我們有可能成為工作夥伴，我想他不會騙我的

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？

en-US	That is to say, when you took this cell phone into Taiwan, there would be somebody to get contact with you, meet you, and take this golf bag?

en-US	You also mentioned that except for the cell phone, the person also gave you four hundred US dollars…Is the money monetary compensation?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我想說這是給我拿來住旅館和吃飯的錢

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不，我完全不知道海洛因在球桿裡面

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don’t you think that if you just bring the gold into Taiwan, the monetary compensation is much higher?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我不知道這樣的代價算不算高，我只是想賺一點錢

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Did you ever come into your mind that why the person didn’t want to bring it by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	肯特跟我說他很忙，他需要有人幫他

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even if there is real gold in the golf bag, you should know that bringing gold into Taiwan maybe illegal, don’t you?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我只知道黃金在曼谷比較便宜，但我真的不知道帶黃金進台灣會是違法的

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就是只是黃金阿，會有問題嗎? 不是嗎?

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	When you took the bag, did you check the things in it?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	不，我沒有檢察，因為袋子被封起來了我不認為我可以把那個袋子打開

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	So do you trust the person so much? Don’t you think you might be lied?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我在三月遇到肯特，我為他工作，我認為我們是伙伴，所以我當然是願意幫他工作他看起來是個好人，我覺得他不會騙我

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	是，我以為我們是一起工作的，所以我才信任他

zh-TW	你所帶的高爾夫球袋，是隨身行李還是託運行李？
en-US	And the golf bag you took, it’s a carry-on or check-in luggage?

en-US	It was my carry-on.
zh-TW	那是我的隨身行李。 

zh-TW	你知道高爾夫球袋中，有幾根桿子嗎？

en-US	I don’t know a few, maybe.
zh-TW	我並不確定。

zh-TW	那你知道球桿中藏有毒品嗎？

zh-TW	這個袋子是一個叫肯特的人拿給我的，我們在泰國曼谷相會，然後他把這個袋子給我。我是一個電腦程式設計師，他把袋子在曼谷的KFC交給我，然後要我帶入台灣。

zh-TW	給你高爾夫球袋、要你把它帶入台灣的人是誰？ 你認識他嗎？知道對方的姓名嗎? 
en-US	Do you know he/she? And do you know his name?

en-US	I only know him as Kent, we met earlier in March 2013.

en-US	I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.
zh-TW	我想這是他真正的名字，但我並不知道他的姓。 

zh-TW	他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？
en-US	What’s the place that he gave you the golf bag?

en-US	He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	我們是在曼谷的一家肯德基見面。

zh-TW	你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
en-US	Why you wanted to take a golf bag for him to Taiwan?

en-US	He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
zh-TW	他告訴我，如果我幫他把高爾夫球袋帶到台灣的話，他會給我一千美金，我想賺一點錢，並且我想這是一件容易的事情。

zh-TW	你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that he promised you to give you $1000, and he wanted you to take the bag to Taiwan?

en-US	Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
zh-TW	沒錯，他只是叫我把袋子帶到台灣，並沒有叫我做其他任何事。

zh-TW	對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
en-US	Didn’t he tell you what’s the next step? And did anyone will get in touch with you?

en-US	Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
zh-TW	肯特先生叫我待在某個旅館，並跟我說，將會有人打電話到它給我的手機裡面。

zh-TW	你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
en-US	The cell phone you meant is the one that police confiscated in Taoyuan International Airport?

en-US	Yes, a Nokia phone.
zh-TW	沒錯，那是一隻諾基亞手機。

zh-TW	提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
en-US	Please show the evidence to the defendant. Defendant, is this cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	沒錯，這就是肯特先生給我的那隻手機。

zh-TW	請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
en-US	So, this cell phone is yours?

en-US	No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
zh-TW	不，這並不是屬於我的手機，這是肯特先生給我的，他把SIM卡放在裡面並給我這隻手機。

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that the cell phone is some gave you, and who is the one gave you the golf bag?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	沒錯他就是在肯德基的時候給我這隻手機。

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	What’s the date he gave you the cell phone? And did he gave you any other things?

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我這隻手機，除此之外，他也給我四百美元來付擔飯店住宿費用。

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	And what’s the purpose that he gave you the cell phone?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他告訴我他將會透過這隻手機聯絡我，另外，要來跟我拿高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這隻手機聯絡我。

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that when you take this cell phone into Taiwan, someone will call you and take the golf bag?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	沒錯，肯特先生就是這樣跟我說的，他說有人會跟我見面並跟我拿高爾夫球袋。

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	Do you know who will contact you?

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不，我並不知道是誰。

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	You just said that he gave you $400, and it’s the monetary compensation for you?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我想這四百元只是飯店的住宿費用和食宿費。

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that, besides the $400, you will get more money after you go back to Thailand? 

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	那就是我所知道的，我被告知的是，當我把高爾夫球袋給台灣的人時，等我回到泰國，我可以得到1000美元。

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	So, do you know there was heroin in this bag?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不不不，我並不知道海洛因被藏在高爾夫球杆裡。

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	 Don’t you feel curious about that the value of taking gold into Taiwan for this monetary compensation is very high?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我並沒有想這麼多，我只是額外的想賺點錢。

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Don’t you ever think that why the person didn’t take the bag into Taiwan by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	肯特先生告訴我他非常忙碌，他須要有一個人幫他帶袋子到台灣。

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even though you took gold to Taiwan, you might violate the Law in Taiwan, do you know it?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我知道黃金的價格在台灣比較好，但我並不知道這會違法。

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why would you think it’s no problem taking gold to Taiwan?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就只是黃金阿，為什麼會成為一個問題呢?

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	When you took the bag, did you examine the bag?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	不，我沒有檢查過，因為那個袋子是密封的，而且我也不覺得我可以打開那個袋子。

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	Don’t you think you might be conned by someone? Why you trust him so much?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我剛剛說我跟肯特先生是在三月見面，而且我們一起工作過，我想幫助他不是甚麼大問題，我覺得他是一個很好的人阿，我覺得他不會騙我。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that Mr. Kent want to do business with you and cooperate with you? So, you trust him so much?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	沒錯，我覺得我們可以一起合作，那就是為什麼我這麼相信他的原因。

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	So, besides you just said, do you want to say anything about this case? And do you want the court to find any other evidence for you?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我對於這件事情感到非常抱歉，我不知道袋子裡有甚麼東西，我被告知的是那裡面裝的是黃金，如果我知道裡面是海洛因，我就不會把它帶到台灣，請原諒我好嗎?

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	Besides Kent, do you have any more concrete information for police who can find someone who commit you?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有從他那裡得到的資訊如此而已。

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	Currently, you stay in the house, do you want the court contact anyone for you?

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
zh-TW	你可不可以通知我在曼谷的家人，或是我在英國的小孩呢?我想他們一定很擔心我，我必須在12月的時候回到曼谷。

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	The next court will be the trial procedure, and you can have the lawyer. After you have a lawyer, he/she will meet you and understand you case. Do you understand? If it’s necessary, the lawyer will contact the family for you. Do you understand?

en-US	In other words, when you take this phone in Taiwan, there will somebody to call you and meet up with you to take the golf bag?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	對，肯特告訴我，會有人打這支手機給我，跟我在台灣拿高爾夫球袋。

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	Do you know who will contact with you?

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不，我不知道誰會打給我。

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	As you said, the person also gave you four hundred US dollars. Was that monetary compensation?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我認為那400美元只是為了支付我的飯店跟吃的費用吧。

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	So, besides the four hundred US dollars, when you successfully go back to Thailand, will you get another one thousand US dollars?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	我認為就是這樣，只要我把高爾夫球袋帶來台灣交給那個人以後在回到泰國，就可以拿到1000美金。

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	So when you receive this mission, did you know you bring heroin?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不不不！！我不知道球棒裡藏了海洛因。

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don’t you think if he just ask you to bring gold in Taiwan, the price, 1000US dollars, is much higher?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我不知道價錢算不算高，我只是想賺點小錢。

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Don’t you think that why that person bring this bag by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	肯特告訴我他有點忙，他需要有人幫他這個忙。

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even though there is gold in your club, you should know that bringing gold in Taiwan might violate the law, is that right?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我知道金價在泰國比較便宜，但是我不知道攜帶黃金入境有沒有違法。

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why don’t you think there is no problem to bring the gold in Taiwan?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就是黃金啊！應該不會有什麼問題，不是嗎？

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	When you take this bag, did you check the thing inside?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	我沒有檢查袋子裡面，因為它被密封了。我不認為我可以打開來看。

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	So, you trust the person so much that you did not think you might be  conned?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我3月的時候遇到肯特，那時候我要為他工作，所以你知道我們可能是工作伙伴，所以我就幫他工作。他看起來是一個不錯的人，我不覺得他會騙我。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	Did you mean the person show his sincerity to work with you, so that’s the reason why you trust him so much?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對，我想我跟他一起工作，我們是工作伙伴，所以我才很相信他。

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	Besides those questions, do you have anything to add? Is there any evidence, which you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我很抱歉發生了這種事，我不知道有什麼在袋子裡面。他告訴我,袋子裡面的是黃金，如果是海落因的話，我就不會幫他帶袋子了,請你原諒我。

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	Besides the person, Kent, can you provide more concrete information which can help the police to investigate the details that who asked for your help?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我有的就只有他給我的那支電話。

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	For now, you are in detention, do you want us to notify anyone for you? 

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
zh-TW	可以請你通知我在曼谷的家人，或我在英國的孩子嗎？他們一定很擔心我，我本來打算在12月下半月的時候回去。

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	Next time, we will have trial procedure. You can have your legal assistant, after you choose the lawyer, he or she can meet up with you and help you understand the crime, do you understand? If that is necessary, your lawyer can help you to contact with your family, do you understand

en-US	Yes, I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了。

zh-TW	檢察官有沒有需要進一步調查的證據？

zh-TW	他說他會打這支手機給我,當然,他也有說那個當我到台灣後會跟我聯絡的人也會打這支手機

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that after arrive Taiwan, there will a person that will going to contact with you and will pick up the gold bag?

zh-TW	不不不不不,我真的不知道在那個高爾夫球袋的是海洛因,我是真的真的真的不知道

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don’t you think that if he just ask you to broght the gold into Taiwan, this compensation, also US1000, is much higher?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我不知道這個代價或是這個價錢有這麼高,我只是想賺點錢而已

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？

zh-TW	沒有阿,我沒有檢查,因為當我拿到這個袋子時他是密封起來的,我不認為我有這個權力可以打開他

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	Do you think that you will be conceived, why would you…. trust Kent so much?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	當我在三月遇到Kent的時候我就只是他的員工阿,我只是想為他工作,我就只是想為他工作而已,我認為他是一個非常好的人,我不認為他會欺騙我

en-US	 Please tell me again who give you the golf bag and…who give you this gold bag, and asked you to take into Taiwan? Do you know who he is and…do you know his name?

en-US	I only know him as Kent, we met earlier in March 2013.
zh-TW	我只知道他的名字叫做Kent，然後我們是在2013年的3月認識的。

zh-TW	Kent是對方的姓、還是名？這是他的真名嗎？
en-US	Kent…is this his last name, or the first name? Is this even his real name?

en-US	I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.
zh-TW	我想這應該是他真的名字吧？但我不知道他的姓是甚麼。

zh-TW	他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？
en-US	Where did he give you this gold bag?

en-US	He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	他跟我講在曼谷一間肯德基跟他見面。

zh-TW	你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
en-US	So why did you agree to bring this golf bag to Taiwan...for his help?

en-US	He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
zh-TW	他告訴我如果我幫他把這個高爾夫球袋帶到台灣，他就會給我一千美金。我就想賺點外快嘛，而且這聽起來不是很難的工作。

zh-TW	你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
en-US	So you did you say…the other person agree you to pay you…pay you some compensation and the price…and ask you to take this bag to Taiwan, is that right?

en-US	Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
zh-TW	對，他告訴我只要把袋子帶進台灣，其他甚麼都不用做。

zh-TW	對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
en-US	Did he mention what will happen when you arrived Taiwan? I mean, is there anybody will contact you?

en-US	Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
zh-TW	Kent叫我待在某間指定的旅館，就會有人用他給我的手…就會有人打電話給我，用他給我的手機。

zh-TW	你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
en-US	The cellphone you just mentioned, is that the cellphone which the police had confiscated in Taoyuan International Airport?

en-US	Yes, a Nokia phone.
zh-TW	對，那是一支Nokia的手機。 

zh-TW	提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
en-US	OK, now please see this evidence number one. So, can you make sure is this cellphone the one you just mentioned?

en-US	Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	對，這支就是Kent給我的手機。

zh-TW	請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
en-US	Is this cellphone belongs to you?

en-US	No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
zh-TW	不是，這支手機不是”我的”。這支手機是Kent給我的。他把SIM卡放進去之後才把這支手機給我。

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean this cellphone is given by the one who ask you to being the golf bag into Taiwan? 

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	對，他是在肯德基給我這支手機的。

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	When is the date did he give you the cellphone? Does anything else did he give you?

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷的前一天給這支手機。除了手機之外，他還給我四百美金來支付旅館和食物的錢。

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	So what is the exact purpose or the use of this cellphone that he gave you?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他告訴我他會透過這支手機連絡我，而且那個…理論上要來拿這個袋子的人，他也會用這支手機聯絡我。

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	Which means there will someone contact you through this cellphone number, meet you, and take the bag from you…after you get into Taiwan?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	對，Kent跟我說會有人跟我聯絡，然後會來拿這個袋子。

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	 Did you know who will be you contact?

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不，我完全不知道誰會連絡我。

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	As you had mentioned earlier, beside the cellphone, the one who give you…the man also gave you four hundred US dollars. Is that…can you count…is that a compensation for you?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我想這筆錢是用來付旅館和我吃…食物的費用。

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	So…besides this four hundred US dollars, after you success…after you finished you job and get back to Thailand, will you receive another one thousand US dollars?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	對，我想應該是這樣子沒有錯。等我把袋子成功交給對方，然後在回代泰國之後，我就會再收到另外一千美金。 

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	So when the very beginning…when you take…took this job, do you understand…do you know that the thing you are carrying is heroine?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不不不不不…我完全…完全不知道在球袋裡面藏的是海洛因。

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Well…do you think the cost...if just bringing gold into Taiwan, this price, which means one thousand dollars, a little bit too high for this job

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我真的不知道這個代價是不是真的太高。但我就只是想賺點零用錢嘛。

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Did it ever cross your mind why the person don’t want to bring the thing by them…by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	Kent跟我說他很忙，就需要有人來幫他這個忙。

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Well…even if there is real gold in the golf bag, you should…you should know it might be illegal to bring gold into Taiwan, isn’t it?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我知道黃金在泰國是比較便宜，但我真的不知道帶黃金入境是不是在台灣是算是違法的事情。

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why did you think it won’t be a problem to bring gold into Taiwan?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金不就是黃金嘛，應該不會是甚麼大問題，不是嗎

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	When you bringing the bag, did you ever exam the thing inside it?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	沒有，我沒有檢查，因為袋子被封起來了。我覺得我可能不太應該把袋子打開。

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	So you were just that trust the other person? Don’t you ever thought the possibility of being de…deceived

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我和Kent在三月認識的時候，我本來是要幫他工作的，我就是有可能成為夥伴阿，所以我是可以…我當然願意幫他工作。他看起來人很好啊，是個好人，我沒有想過他會騙我。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	So do you mean the other person have…have indicated the work relationship with you, so you don’t ever doubt him?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對，我覺得…我以為我們會一起工作，這就是我這麼信任他的原因。

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	OK. So, beside the questions you just being asked, is there anything you want to add? Is there any evidence you wish the court will investigate…will make a further investigation?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我真的很抱歉發生這樣的事情，我真的不知道袋子裡裝的是甚麼。他告訴我袋子裡的是黃金，如果我知道裡面是海洛英的話，我是絕對不會把袋子帶進台灣來的。請原諒我。

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	Besides Kent, do you have any…Do you have more concrete information to help the police to track who is your…er…ask you help?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有那支他給我的手機。

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	So far, you are detained. Is there anyone you want…you want us to inform for you… to contact for you?

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
zh-TW	可以請你們幫我聯絡我在曼谷的家人，或者是在英國我的小孩嗎？他們應該蠻擔心我，因為我本來是回…因為我本來預計在十二月底回曼谷的。

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	Next court will be a trail procedure. You can choose your attorney. After you have your attorney, he or she can meet you and understand the case. Do you understand that? If it is necessary, your attorney can also help you to contact you family. Do you understand that?

en-US	Yes, I understand.
zh-TW	嗯我明白。

zh-TW	檢察官有沒有需要進一步調查的證據？
en-US	The prosecutor…Is there anything the prosecutor want to ask?

zh-TW	如卷所示。
en-US	Just as the record had said.

zh-TW	準備程序到此結束，訂中華民國103年4月9日早上10點40分進行審理程序。
en-US	OK. So today the procedure will end here. And we will hair…have the trail procedure in the 20…April 9th, 2013…10:40 in the morning.

zh-TW	我記得我的班次是在民國102年的12月5號，我不記得航班的班次號碼了，不過我記得是在早上六點半起飛的。我在香港轉機，那轉機的時間大概等了1小時20分。

zh-TW	你所帶的高爾夫球袋，是隨身行李還是託運行李？

en-US	It was my carry-on.
zh-TW	那是我的隨身行李

zh-TW	我不知道耶，我只知道我要把高爾夫球袋帶來台灣，裡面裝的是金塊

zh-TW	這高爾夫球袋是誰給你的？在哪裡給你的？

en-US	The name of the guy who gave me the bag was Kent. I met him in Bangkok and he hired me to work for him. I am a computer engineer. He gave me this one ball bag at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	這個帶子是一個叫肯特的人給我的，我在曼谷認識他的，他僱用我將袋子帶到台灣來，我是一個電腦工程師，他讓我把這個高爾夫球袋帶到台灣來，他是在曼谷的肯德基給我的。

zh-TW	給你高爾夫球袋、要你把它帶入台灣的人是誰？ 你認識他嗎？知道對方的姓名嗎?

en-US	Where did he give the golf bag?

en-US	He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	他跟我說約在曼谷的肯德基見面

zh-TW	你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
en-US	So why do you take the golf bag to Taiwan for him?

en-US	He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
zh-TW	他說如果我願意幫他把高爾夫球袋帶到台灣的話，他會給我一千美金做為報酬，我想要賺點小外快，所以我想應該這是件很簡單的工作。

zh-TW	你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
en-US	So you mean he promised you to give you 1000 US dollars as monetary compensation and you should bring the golf bag to Taiwan, right

en-US	Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
zh-TW	式的，他告訴我只要把袋子帶到台灣就好了，其他什麼都不用做

zh-TW	對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
en-US	Did he tell you that when you arrived Taiwan what will happen? I mean will somebody connect with you?

en-US	Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
zh-TW	肯特跟我說只要待在旅館裡面，靜靜等著會有人打電話給我

zh-TW	你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
en-US	The cell phone you just mentioned, is the one the police take from you from the Taoyuan National Airport.

en-US	Yes, a Nokia phone.
zh-TW	是的，他是一隻諾基亞的手機。

zh-TW	提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
en-US	I am going to show you the phone. Please check it is that the cell phone you bring that you mentioned.

en-US	Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	是的，這就是肯特給我的手機

zh-TW	請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
en-US	Is the cell phone your personal phone

en-US	No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
zh-TW	不，他並非我個人的手機，這支手機是肯特給我的，他將SIM卡放入後才給我。

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	So you mean the cell phone is the person who ask you to bring the golf bag to Taiwan gave you?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	是的，他在肯德基將這支手機交給我

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	Then when did he gave you the cell phone and what else did he give you?

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我那支手機。除了手機之外他給我400美元作為餐費還有旅館的費用

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	So what exact is his purpose to give you this cell phone?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他說他會透過這支手機跟我聯繫，而且那個要跟我拿球袋的人會打這支電話給我跟我聯絡

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	That is to say, when you arrived Taiwan, someone will call you through this cell phone and take the golf bag from you?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	對的，肯特告訴我當我到了台灣會有人打這支電話給我跟我拿高爾夫球袋

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	Do you know who will contact into you?

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不，我不知道誰會打給我

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	As you mentioned, the person who gave you the golf bag also gave you 400 US dollars, is it a kind of monetary compensation?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我想那筆錢只是用來支付我的餐費還有旅館的費用而已

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	So except the 400 US dollars, you mean after you go back to Bangkok, you get another 100 dollars? Rather, 1000 dollars.

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	我是這麼想的，我的理解是當我順利的將高爾夫球袋拿到台灣並且順利地交給那個人之後，回到泰國我可以拿到我的酬勞

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	So do you know what you broght to Taiwan is heroine

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不不不，我根本不知道海洛因藏在球桿裡面

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don’t you think if you just bring the gold to Taiwan, the monetary compensation for gold is too high?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我沒有特別去思考報酬是不是過高，我只是想賺錢而已

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Then have you think of that what did the person bring his bag to Taiwan by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	肯特跟我說他太忙碌了，所以需要一個人幫他帶過來

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Well, even if it is gold in the golf bag, you should know that bringing the golf to Taiwan may be violet the law, isn’t it?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我想說黃金在泰國沒有很值錢，我沒有想過帶來台灣會是違法的

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	What do you think bringing to Taiwan isn’t a problem?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金不就是黃金而已嗎? 會構成什麼大問題呢?

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	Have you checked what is inside the golf bag when you took it?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	沒有ㄟ我沒有檢查，因為袋子是密封的，我不覺得我可以擅自打開他

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	So you just easy trust the person and never thought you might be conned?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我在3月的時候讓是肯特的，你知道當時我準備跟他合作經營公司，所以我想我應該可以幫助他，他看起來是個好人，我不覺得他會騙我

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	So you men Kent want to cooperate with you to run a business so you think there is no problem with him?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對啊我想說我們會一起合作，所以就不疑有他

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	OK, beside what you have mentioned before, do you have anything else to say? Is there and evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我對於發生的一切感到很抱歉，我真的不知道袋子裡面裝了什麼，我當時真的以為袋子裡面裝的是黃金，如果我知道他是海洛因的話，我絕對不會貪心到把它帶來台灣的，請原諒我

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	Well. Besides Kent, do you have more concrete information that which can help the police to search the person or any other thing for you?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有他給我的那支手機而已

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	Now you are in detention, do you want to contact with anyone?

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
zh-TW	你可以幫我聯絡我在曼谷的家人嗎?或是我在英國的孩子們呢?他們一定很擔心我，我原本預計在12月底回到曼谷的

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	Next court will be the trial procedure. You can hire a lawyer. As you choose the lawyer, the lawyer can meet with you and understand what happened. Do you understand? Do you have further questions? If it is necessary, your lawyer can contact your family for you. Do you understand?

en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	檢察官有沒有需要進一步調查的證據？

zh-TW	這高爾夫球袋是誰給你的？在哪裡給你的？

zh-TW	他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？
en-US	Where did he give you the golf bag?

en-US	He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	他跟我說要在曼谷的一間肯德基見面。

zh-TW	你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
en-US	Why did you help him bring that golf bag to Taiwan?

en-US	He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
zh-TW	他說如果我願意帶這個到台灣的話，他會付給我一千塊美金的酬勞。我想要賺點錢，所以覺得這個工作還不錯。

zh-TW	你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
en-US	So did you say that that person is willing to pay you 1000 US dollars, and ask you to bring that bag to Taiwan, right?

en-US	Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
zh-TW	對，他跟我說只要把這個帶到台灣就好，其他什麼都不用做。

zh-TW	對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
en-US	Did that person tell you what will happen after you arrive at Taiwan? Will anyone meet you or something else

en-US	Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
zh-TW	他叫我待在一間旅館裡面，然後他有給我一隻電話，然後說有人會打給我。 

zh-TW	你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
en-US	 Is the cell phone you’re talking about the one which I confiscated in Taoyuan International Airport?

en-US	Yes, a Nokia phone.
zh-TW	對，是Nokia的手機。

zh-TW	提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
en-US	So please look at this page, and is the cell phone the one you were talking about?

en-US	Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	對，這就是Kent給我的那隻手機。

zh-TW	請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
en-US	Is this your own cell phone?

en-US	No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
zh-TW	不是，這不是我的啦。這隻手機是Kent的，他把sim卡放到手機來，然後給我的。

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	 You mean that this cell phone was from the person who gave you the golf bag?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	對，他是在肯德基給我的。

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	On which day did he give it to you? In addition to that phone, what else did he give you?

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他是在我離開曼谷的前一天給我的。除此之外，他還給了我四百塊，是要付旅館的費用還有食物….食物的費用。

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	What is the purpose of this cell phone he gave you?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他說他用這隻手機聯絡我。還有就是要跟我拿高爾夫球帶的人會打到這隻手機…會用這隻手機聯絡我。

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	So you mean that after you bring this cell phone into Taiwan, someone will call you and meet you to take the golf bag away?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	對，Kent跟我說我抵達台灣後會有人打電話給我，要拿這個高爾夫球袋。

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	So do you know who that person will be? The person who will contact you.

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	我不知道是誰耶。

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	You said that in addition to this cell phone, that person also gave you 400 US dollars, is that your pay or something else?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我覺得那應該是我飯店和吃飯的費用吧。 

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	 So after you…in addition to this 400 US dollars, after you successfully get back to Bangkok…get back to Thailand, you will get another 100 US dollars?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	我是這樣理解的。就是我把東西拿到台灣之後，回到泰國，我就會收到1000塊美金。

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	So did you know that you were trafficking heroine when that person ask you to do that?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	我完全不知道球竿裡面是海洛因。

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	 Well, don’t you think that if that person is simply asking you to bring gold to Taiwan, this price, 1000 US dollars, is a bit high?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我不知道這個價格算不算高，我只是要一點…就是只是想賺錢而已。

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Did you think about why that person…was not willing to bring that by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	Kent是跟我說他很忙，需要人家幫忙。

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even if…in the…there is…even if you know that it is gold in the golf bag, you should know that bringing gold into Taiwan may be against the law…isn’t that true?...Is that true?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我知道黃金在泰國是比較便宜，但我沒有想過說帶進台灣是不是違法的。

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why do you think that there will be no problem if you bring gold into Taiwan?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就是黃金啊，應該沒有什麼問題吧。

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	When you get…got the bag, did you take a look at what is inside?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	沒有啊，因為包包就是被封起來的。我覺得我不應該把它打開

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	 So you…you believe that person, you didn’t think that you might be cheated?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我是在三月的時候遇到Kent的，他那個時候就僱用我，我就覺得我們是合作夥伴啊，我覺得我們可以合作這樣。他看起來人很好，我不覺得他會騙我啊。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	You said that that person was willing to work with you, so you didn’t doubt anything?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對啊，我覺得我們應該是合作夥伴，所以我就相信他了。

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	OK, so in addition to what you have just said, what…do you want to say anything else? Anything to add? Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我真的很抱歉發生了這樣的事情，我真的不知道裡面放的是什麼。我真的以為是黃金，如果我知道是海洛因的話，我絕對不會因為那個前把它帶到台灣。拜託原諒我。

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	Well, in addition to Kent…the name Kent, do you have any concrete information for the police to find who that person is?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有他給我的那隻手機。

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	So far you are in detention, is there anyone you want us to inform that you are here?

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
zh-TW	你可以聯絡我在曼谷的朋友嗎？或者我在英國的小孩。他們應該很擔心我，因為我本來是十二月底就要回去的。

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	 The next time we will be doing the…investigatory procedure. You can have a legal assistance, and after that, that person will meet you and understand your case, is that OK with you? If it’s necessary, your legal assistance will help you to contact your family as well. Do you understand?

en-US	Yes, I understand.
zh-TW	了解。

zh-TW	檢察官有沒有需要進一步調查的證據？
en-US	Prosecutor, would you like to investigate any further evidence?

zh-TW	如卷所示。
en-US	It’s the same as the document.

zh-TW	準備程序到此結束，訂中華民國103年4月9日早上10點40分進行審理程序。

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對我以為我們會一起工作所以我相信他。

en-US	…Does this cellphone belong to you?

en-US	No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
zh-TW	不是，不是屬於「我」的。這隻手機是Kent給我的，他把SIM卡放進去後，交給我的。

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	You mean that this cellphone belongs to the person who gave you the golf bag?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	對，他在肯德基給我的。

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	On what date did he give it to you? Besides the cellphone, did he give you anything else

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我手機的。除此之外，他給我了400塊美金，是為了飯店的錢，還有….食物的錢。

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	So what is the purpose of him giving you the cellphone?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他跟我說他會透過這隻手機和我聯絡。還有會…會到台灣和我領這個包包的人會透過這隻手機聯絡我。

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	Which means, when you arrive in Taiwan with this cellphone, somebody will call you through this phone and meet with you to receive the golf bag?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	是。Kent有跟我說有人會在我抵達台灣之後聯絡我，和我領取這個包包。

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	So do you know who will get into contact with you?

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不，我不知道誰會打給我。

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	…You mentioned 400 dollars and the cellphone. Does this count as the monetary compensation?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我想，那四百塊應該是我飯店跟伙食的支出。

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	So, besides that 400 US dollars, you will receive more money once you get back to Thailand successfully? 

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	我是這麼以為的。在我到台灣交付這個高爾夫球袋之後，就可以回到泰國，然後領取那1000塊美金。

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	So when you accepted this offer, you knew what you were bringing was heroine?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不不不不，我完全沒有想到球桿裡面會藏有海洛因。

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don’t you think that to bring gold into Taiwan, 1000 dollars, this is a bit high?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我不知道這樣的價格是不是太高，我只是想要賺更多錢。

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Haven’t you ever questioned why he didn’t bring it himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	Kent和我說他太忙了，而需要人來幫助他。

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even if in the golf bag, it was gold, you should know that bringing gold into the country could be against the law, isn’t that right?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我知道在泰國黃金的價錢會更便宜，但我不知道帶到台灣這是違法..或是不違法。

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why did you think that bringing gold would be okay

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就只是黃金吧，他並不會造成什麼大問題的啊

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	When you were carrying the golf bag, did you check what it held inside?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	我沒有，因為袋子被封起來了。我不覺得我可以打開它。

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	You have that much faith in him, you don’t think you were being conned?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我在三月的時候認識Kent，而那時候我覺得可以為他工作，或成為夥伴你知道嗎..或著是為他工作。他感覺像是一個好人，感覺不會騙我。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	So you thought he wanted to work with you as business partners, so you didn’t question him at all?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對，我以為我們會一起工作。這也是為什麼我會這麼信任他。

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	Okay, beside your replies from before, is there anything you wish to say? Is there any evidence that you wish for the court to investigate?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我對此感到很抱歉，我不知道袋子裡面裝了什麼東西。我以為裡面是黃金，要是有人和我說裡面是海洛因的話，我絕對不會答應要帶到台灣的。請原諒我。

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	Besides Kent, do you have any more concrete information to help the police to find who the person who… asked to bring the bag is?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我就只有他給我的那隻手機。

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the cell phone was give by the person who asked you to bring the golf bag to Taiwan?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	對，他在肯德基給我的。

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	Then on what date did that person hand you the cell phone, and did he gave you anything else?

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我手機。除了手機以外，他還給我四百美金，讓我住飯店，提供食宿費。

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	Then what is the main purpose of him handling the phone to you? 

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他告訴我他能透過這支手機與我聯絡。還有，要拿這個高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這支電話打給我。

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	Okay, so do you mean that after you brought this cell phone to Taiwan, someone will contact you and ask you to hand him the golf bag?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	對，坎特告訴我，會有人打電話給我，到達台灣之後。

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	Then, do you know who will be your contact? 

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不知道，完全不知道誰會打給我。

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	You’ve just said that besides giving you the cell phone, he actually gave you USD 400, does this mean a monetary compensation? 

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我覺得那是我的飯店食宿費阿。

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	So, in addition to this USD 400, if you successfully returned to Thailand, he will still hand you the rest of the money?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	據我所知，對。我在台灣給了那個人高爾夫球袋以後，我將會回到泰國，然後就會拿到1000元美金了。

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	So the time you accepted this offer, did you know that the bag was filled with heroin?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	噢，完全不知道，完全不知道海洛因會藏在球竿裡面。

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Didn’t you think that if it were just gold, then the USD 1000 monetary compensation would be a little bit too high?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我並不知道這樣算很高阿，我只是想要賺點錢而已。

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Didn’t you ever wonder that why that person won’t bring that thing by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	坎特告訴我他很忙，所以需要有人幫他帶阿。

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even if it were gold in the golf bag, you should’ve had the clear idea that bringing gold to our country is against the law. 

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我是知道泰國的黃金比較便宜啦，我並不知道帶黃金入境會違法。

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why would you think that it isn’t against the law? 

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	就只是黃金而已阿，有甚麼問題阿?

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	When you got the bag, did you examine the things in the bag?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	沒有，因為那個袋子就被扣得緊緊的了。而且我覺得打開它並不適當。

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	Why did you trust that person so easily? Weren’t you afraid of being conned?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我在三月的時候，遇到了坎特阿，我要跟他一起工作，所以我們會變同事。他看來人很好阿，不像是會騙我的人。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	Do you mean to say that that person wished to collaborate with you, so you just trusted him?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	是，我認為我們以後會變同事，一起工作，所以我就信任他了。

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	 Okay, so after these questions, do you have anything to add? Is there any evidence the court wishes to further investigate?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我為我的行為感到非常抱歉。我不知道袋子裡有甚麼東西。對方就告訴我裡面是黃金，如果我知道裡面是海洛因，我才不會幫助他帶回台灣呢。請原諒我。

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	In addition to Kent, do you have any further evidence of who asked you to bring the golf bag to Taiwan?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有他給我的那支手機。

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	Now you’re being detained, do you have any person that you need to inform? 

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
zh-TW	你可以幫我通知我在泰國的家人或是在英國的朋友嗎?他一定擔心死了，因為我在12底的時候，會再回泰國呢。

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	Next time will be the trial procedure, and you have the right to a lawyer, and the lawyer will meet you to understand the case, do you understand? If it is necessary, the lawyer can also help you contact your family. Is it clear?

en-US	Yes, I understand.
zh-TW	恩，明白。

zh-TW	檢察官有沒有需要進一步調查的證據？
en-US	Does the investigator wish to search for further evidence?

zh-TW	如卷所示。
en-US	Same as the investigatory record.

zh-TW	準備程序到此結束，訂中華民國103年4月9日早上10點40分進行審理程序。

en-US	So, is your golf bag carry-on or checked-in luggage?

en-US	It was my carry-on.
zh-TW	是我的隨身行李。

zh-TW	我不知道我的高爾夫球桿裡有毒品，我……

zh-TW	這高爾夫球袋是誰給你的？在哪裡給你的？

en-US	The name of the guy who gave me the bag was Kent. I met him in Bangkok and he hired me to work for him. I am a computer engineer. He gave me this one ball bag at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	是個叫做肯特人給我的。我在Bangkok遇到他，然後他僱用我。我是個電腦工程師，他在Bangkok時要我把這帶去台灣。

zh-TW	給你高爾夫球袋、要你把它帶入台灣的人是誰？ 你認識他嗎？知道對方的姓名嗎?

zh-TW	他是在Bangkok的肯德基給我的。

zh-TW	你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
en-US	Why did you bring this golf bag to Tawian for him?

zh-TW	他說如果我把這個帶到台灣會付我美金1000元。我想賺錢，所以認為這是的滿簡單的工作。

zh-TW	你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that the person will pay you 1,000 US dollars to let you bring this bag to Taiwan?

en-US	Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
zh-TW	對，他是這樣跟我說的，他說我只要把這個帶過來，也不用作其他事情。

zh-TW	對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
en-US	So, can you tell me that, before you came to Taiwan, whether he told you what happened after you arrived at Taiwan or who will get into contact with you?

en-US	Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
zh-TW	Kent叫我待在一間旅館，然後會有人接洽我。

zh-TW	你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
en-US	Can you tell me that the cell phone is the same as the one found in Taoyuan International Airport by the police?

en-US	Yes, a Nokia phone.
zh-TW	對，那牌子是Nokia的。

zh-TW	提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。

zh-TW	請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
en-US	Was that cell phone yours?

en-US	No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
zh-TW	不，這並不是我的手機。那是肯特給我的手機，他還把SIM卡放在這個手機裡面。

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that this cell phone was given by the person that asked you to bring the golf bag to Taiwan?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	對，他也在那家肯德基給我這隻手機。

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	Could you tell me the date that he gave you the cell phone? Besides, did he give you other things?

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開Bangkok前給我這隻手機。除了手機之外，他還有給我400美金供我住宿還有伙食。

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	Could you tell me what is this for?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他說他會藉由這個手機來聯絡我。它還跟我說，要拿這個高爾夫球袋的人也會用遮手機來聯絡我。

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	That is to say, did you say that after you arrived at Taiwan, there is a person that will call you and will meet up with you for this bag?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	對，肯特說當我到台灣之後，會有人聯絡我來拿這一個高爾夫球袋。

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	Do you know the person that will get into contact with you?

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不，我不知道他是誰。

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	Before, you have mentioned beside the cell phone, he also gave you 400 hundred dollars, is that classified as monetary compensation?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我認為那是我支付飯店以及伙食的款項。

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that after you arrive at Thailand, you will further get 1,000 US dollars in addition to this 400 hundred dollars?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	我是這麼認為的。在我把高爾夫球袋帶去台灣之後，我會回泰國，就可拿到那1,000元美金。

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	So, did you mean that you have known the bag contained heroin before you get the case?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不不不，我不知道裡面有海洛因。

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don’t you know that the paying in Taiwan for bringing gold is very high?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我不知道那代價是否太高，我只是想賺點外快。

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Have you ever thought that the reason that the person did not bring the bag by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	特有跟我說過他很忙，他需要有個人幫她。

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even though you knew that there was gold in the bag, did you know that bring gold is the violation against the law in Taiwan?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我知道在泰國黃金比較便宜，但我不知道把黃金帶到台灣是否違法。 

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why did you think that bring gold into Taiwan will not constitute the violation of law?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就是黃金，應該不會造成什麼問題。

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	Did you check the items inside the bag when you received it?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	不，我沒有去檢查，因為這個高爾夫球袋是封著的。我認為我不太恰當去打開他

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	You just trusted the person. And, are you not afraid of being conned?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	就像我前面說的，我在3月時見過他，我認為他是我的工作夥伴。他似乎是個不錯的人，我覺得他不會騙我。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that the person shows his willing to cooperate with you as the partners in business, so you did not doubt him?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對，我認為我們是可以一起合作的，所以我相信他。

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	So, beside the statements you have made before, did you want to add anything? Is there any evidence that you hope to ask the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我對這件事情真的感到很抱歉。我不知道在那個包包裡面的是什麼。我不知道在裡面的不是黃金，如果是海洛因，我就不會引起貪念把這個高爾夫球袋帶來台灣。請原諒我。

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	In addition to Kent, can you provide more concrete information for the police to find who is the client asked you to bring the golf bag and more details?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有他給我的那隻手機。

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？

zh-TW	可以跟我在Bangkok的家人以及在英國的孩子嗎?他們應該很擔心我，因為我跟他們說好我在12月底就會回Bangkok。

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	The next court is the trail procedure. You have the right to a lawyer. After you hire a lawyer, the lawyer will plan to meet up with you o understand what happened. Do you understand? It can be necessary that the lawyer can help you to contact with your family. Do you understand?

zh-TW	這高爾夫球袋是誰給你的？在哪裡給你的？

zh-TW	是一個叫做肯特的人給我的，我在曼谷遇到他，他雇用我我是一個電腦工程師，他在曼谷的肯德基給我這個高爾夫球袋

zh-TW	給你高爾夫球袋、要你把它帶入台灣的人是誰？ 你認識他嗎？知道對方的姓名嗎? 
en-US	Who gave you this bag and asked you to bring to Taiwan? Do you really know him? What's his name?

en-US	I only know him as Kent, we met earlier in March 2013.
zh-TW	我只知道他叫做肯特，我們在2013年3月認識的

zh-TW	Kent是對方的姓、還是名？這是他的真名嗎？
en-US	Kent is his first name? or last name? Is this his real name?

en-US	I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.
zh-TW	我想那是他的真名阿，只是我不知道他的姓

zh-TW	他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？
en-US	Where did this person give you the golf bag?

en-US	He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	他叫我在曼谷的某間肯德基與他碰面

zh-TW	你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
en-US	Why did you help this person to bring the golf bag to Taiwan?

en-US	He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
zh-TW	他答應我要付我1000塊美金的酬勞，要是我把高爾夫球袋帶到台灣的話，我很想要賺錢阿，而且這對我來說是很簡單的事

zh-TW	你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
en-US	You said that this person promised to give you US1000 dollars as monetary compensation if you bring this bag to Taiwan, right?

en-US	Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
zh-TW	是阿他告訴我就只要把這袋子帶到台灣就好了，不用做其他事

zh-TW	對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
en-US	Did this person tell you whether there will be a person to get into contact with you when you arrive at Taiwan?

en-US	Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
zh-TW	他叫我待在一間旅館還給我一隻手機，說有人會打來

zh-TW	你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
en-US	The cell phone you told was the one which was confiscated by the poice in Taoyuan International Airport?

en-US	Yes, a Nokia phone.
zh-TW	是的，是隻諾基亞的手機

zh-TW	提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
en-US	Then I'll show.......Is this cell phone you mentioned before?

en-US	Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	是，就是這支手機，是肯特給我的

zh-TW	請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
en-US	 This cell phone belongs to

en-US	No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
zh-TW	不，不是我個人的手機，這是肯特給我的，他把sim卡放到手機

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	So you mean that this cell phone was given by the person who gave you this bag?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	是的，他在肯德基給我這隻手機

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	When did Kent give you this cell phone? Did he give you anything else

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷前一天給我這隻手機，除了手機外他還給我400元美金當住宿費和伙食費

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	What's the purpose of him?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他告訴我他會用這隻手機聯絡我，另外要找我拿這高爾夫球袋的人也會用這隻手機聯絡我

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	 So if you take this cell phone, someone will call you and meet you to take this bag?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	是的，肯特告訴我，當我到台灣，會有人用這手機打給我來拿高爾夫球袋

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	Do you know who will call you?

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不，我不知道誰會聯絡我

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	You have said that the person who gave you the golf bag also gave you US400 dollars. Is this money regarded as monetary compensation?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我想那只是要當我的住宿費跟伙食費而已

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	So besides US400 dollars, you will get another US1000 dollars after you go back to Thailand?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	據我所知是這樣的，只要我把高爾夫球袋交給那個人，在我回泰國時，就能拿到1000塊美金

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	So you have known that you bring the heroin to Taiwan?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不，不是這樣，我並不知道有海洛因藏在球桿裡

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don't you think that if the person just ask you to bring the gold to Taiwan, he will not give you such a big amount of compensation?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我並不覺得這酬勞是否過高，我只是想要賺錢阿

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Have you ever thought that why the person don't bring this bag by himself

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	肯特說他很忙，需要有人幫他

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	 Even if the things in the club is gold, it also violates the law.

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我只知道黃金在泰國算是便宜的，我並不知道帶黃金回台灣是違法的

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why do you think it was okay to bring gold to Taiwan?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就只是黃金阿，會有什麼大問題嗎?

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	Did you check what was in the bag when you took it

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	沒有，因為這包包被封起來了，我不覺得我可以打開

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	 Don't you ever think that that person will conceive you?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我在三月就認識肯特了，我們可以說是夥伴，我想我是可以為他做事的，我覺得他是好人阿，他應該不會騙我

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	You mean that the person has the willing to work with you, so you just trust him?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對阿，我們會一起工作，這就是我相信他的原因

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	Okay, in addition to the questions you have answered, do you have any further explanation?Do you want to the court to investigate any other evidence?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我很遺憾發生這樣的事，我真的不知道袋子裡是什麼，我一直以為在袋子裡的是黃金，如果知道是黃金，我絕對不會帶來台灣，請原諒我吧

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	Besides Kent, do you have more concrete details to help the police to found the person who gave you this bag?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有那隻他給我的手機

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	So far you have been in detaintion, do you want to call someone?

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
zh-TW	可以聯絡我在曼谷的家人和在英國的孩子嗎?他們一定很擔心我，我本來預計在12月底就能回去的

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	The next court will be the trial procedure. You have the right to a lawyer. After you have a lawyer, you can meet him and know what is going on. Do you understand?If necessary, the lawyer can help you to contact with your family. Understand?

en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	So you mean when you brought this cell phone into Taiwan, there will be someone calling you and meeting you to take the golf bag

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	是的，坎特告訴我當我抵達台灣時，會有人打給我並來拿高爾夫球袋。

zh-TW	不不不不，我並不知道海洛因藏在高爾夫球袋裡面。

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don't you think that if the person just asked you to bring the gold to Taiwan, the monetary compensation, that is, 1000 dollars, is a little too hight?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我不知道這代價到底高不高，我只是想賺點錢而已。

en-US	You trust the person so much and don't think you may be conned?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我和坎特在3月碰面的，我覺得我跟他可以成為很好的工作夥伴啊。我覺得他是個很好的人啊，我不覺得他會欺騙我。

zh-TW	他跟我說他會給我一千美金，如果我幫他把這個袋子帶到台灣，我想要賺一點錢，想說這是個好差事

zh-TW	你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？

zh-TW	肯特叫我待在某一間飯店,然後到時候會有一個人打電話給我

zh-TW	你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
en-US	The cellphone you just answered at Taoyuan international airport. Was that the cellphone the police confiscated at the Taoyuan International Airport?

en-US	Yes, a Nokia phone.
zh-TW	對是一隻Nokia手機

en-US	Please look at the investigatory evidence 1 and defendant prove this is the cellphone you just mentioned.

zh-TW	對這就是肯特給我的手機

zh-TW	請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
en-US	Is this your personal cellphone?

en-US	No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
zh-TW	不這不是我的手機, 這是肯特給我的,他把sim卡插入這支手機裡

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	You mean that this cellphone belong to the person who gave you the golf bag?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	對他在肯德基給我袋子

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	So when did he gave you the bag? Other than the cellphone did he give you anything else?

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我手機, 除了手機之外他還給我四百美金讓我讓我住飯店還有食物需求

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	So what’s the purpose he gave you this cellphone?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	還有要領取高爾夫球袋的人也會利用這支手機連絡我他說他會利用這支手機來聯絡我

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	So with this cellphone, someone will contact you and meet up with you to take the golf bag right?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	對肯特說會有人跟我聯絡,在我入境之後來拿高爾夫球袋

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	Do you know who will contact you?

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不我不知道誰會打給我

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that other than the cellphone, he also gave you 400 USD. Is this some kind of compensation.

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我覺得那是支付我飯店和食物的費用

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	So, other than the 400 USD, after you successfully arrive to Thailand, you will get an extra 1000 USD right?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	這就是我的認知, 在我在台灣把這個袋子交給別人之後,我在泰國就會拿到一千美金酬勞

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	So before you take this offer, did you know you were going to take heroin?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不不不不, 我完全不知道海洛因藏在這些高爾夫球桿裡

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don’t you think that to ask you bring gold into Taiwan with this price 1000 USD, isn’t it a bit too high?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我是不知道代價是不是太高, 但我覺得錢很好賺

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Haven’t you thought for yourself why didn’t that guy bring it himself? 

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	肯特說他很忙需要有人幫他

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even if it’s not heroin but gold, aren’t you supposed to know that bringing certain amount of gold is illegal?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我知道黃金在泰國價格不高, 但是我不知道在台灣違不違法

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why do you think there will be no problem to bring gold into Taiwan?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金也只是黃金, 這不會是太大的問題不是嗎?

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	Did you check the bag before you get the bag?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	我沒有, 因為袋子是封起來的, 我不覺得我有權利把它打開

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	How can you trust someone so easily? Don’t you think you’ll get conned?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我在三月遇到肯特所以未來有可能替他工作, 肯特人感覺很好我沒想到他會騙我

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	You mean he wanted to be in business cooperation with you, so you trusted him right

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對我以為我們會一起工作所以才會相信他

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	Okay so on top of the questions you answered, is there any other statements you want to state? Is there other concrete information or evidence you want the court to investigate?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我對這件事情感到抱歉, 我不知道袋子裡裝得是什麼, 那時候他說是黃金, 我如果知道是海洛因的話, 我絕對不會帶的, 請原諒我拜託

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	Other than Kent, is there someone more specific you can assist the police to investigate who wants you to bring the bag?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有他給我的那支手機

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	You’re currently in detention, do you have anyone to inform?

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
zh-TW	可以連絡我在曼谷的家人或我在英國的小孩嗎? 他們應該很擔心我, 我應該在去年12月底就回到曼谷了

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	Next court trial will be the investigatory procedure, you can choose an attorney you can meet up with the attorney and clarify what happened. If necessary, you can ask the attorney to contact your family. Do you understand

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	是的，他在肯德基裡面給我這支手機。

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	So what is the date he gave you that cellphone? 

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷的前一天給我這支手機。除了手機之外，他還給我四百美金，以支付飯店費用和餐費。

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	So what is the purpose that he gave you that cellphone?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他告訴我，他會透過這支手機跟我聯絡。此外，要來拿高爾夫球袋的人也會透過這支手機跟我聯繫。

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	So do you mean that somebody will call you via this phone and pick up the bag?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	是的，肯特告訴我，有人會跟我聯繫，並且跟我碰面拿走這個球袋。

zh-TW	不，我不知道誰會打電話給我。

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	You just talked about the 400 US dollars, so what is it for, or is it your monetary compensation?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我覺得這是付我的飯店費用和餐費而已。

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	So when you successfully brought this golf bag into Taiwan and returned to Bangkok, you will get another 100 US dollars apart from these 400 US dollars, right?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	對，這是我瞭解到的。對，當我把球袋帶進台灣之後，再回到曼谷，我會拿到另外的一千美金。

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	Did you know at the beginning that what you brought was actually heroine?

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不，我真的不知道海洛因藏在球桿裡面。

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	Don't you think that if he only asked you to bring gold into Taiwan, the monetary compensation, which is 1000 US dollars, is too high?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我不知道這個酬勞算不算太高，我只是想賺一點額外的錢。

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	Have you ever thought that that person would not like to bring this bag into Taiwan on his own? 

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	肯特告訴我他很忙，想找個人幫他。

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	Even if it was gold hidden inside that bag, it would still violate the law set by Taiwan.

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我只知道黃金在泰國比較便宜，我不知道把黃金帶進台灣是不是違法的。

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why do you think that it would be no problem for you to bring gold into Taiwan?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就是黃金，不會有什麼大問題，不是嗎？

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	When you receive the bag, did you check what was inside in that bag? 

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	不，我沒有，因為那個袋子已經被密封住了。我不覺得我可以打開?個袋子。

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	Do you really trust that person that much and do not think that you will be conned? 

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	當我在三月遇到肯特的時候，那個時候我們有可能之後變成工作夥伴。 所以我覺得可以幫他工作，他是一個好人，不會騙我。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	Did he ever say that he would like to work with you as a partner, so you believe in him?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對，所以這就是為什麼我那麼信任他。

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	Apart from the statements you made, do you have anything to add? Is there any evidence that you would like the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我真的所發生的事很抱歉，我不知道袋子裡子藏了什麼東西，他告訴我袋子裡面是黃金，如果我知道袋子裡面是海洛因的話，我真的不會帶這個袋子來台灣。請原諒我。

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	Besides Kent, do you have more concrete information to help the police find the person who asked you to bring the bag?

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有肯特給我的手機而已。

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	Now, you are in detention. Do you have anyone that you would like us to have contact with?

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
zh-TW	你可以幫我聯絡我在曼谷的家人，或是我在英國的小孩嗎? 他們一定很擔心我，我原來應該要在十二月底回到曼谷的。

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	So, the next court will be the trial procedure, and you have the right to a lawyer. After hiring a lawyer, you can meet the lawyer and help him understand the case. Do you understand?If necessary, you can ask the lawyer to have a contact with your family. Do you understand?

en-US	Yes, I understand.
zh-TW	 是的，我明白。

zh-TW	檢察官有沒有需要進一步調查的證據？
en-US	So, the prosecutor, is there any further evidence that you would like to investigate

zh-TW	如卷所示。
en-US	The same as the indictment.

zh-TW	準備程序到此結束，訂中華民國103年4月9日早上10點40分進行審理程序。

en-US	The defendant Julio Johansen on December 5th, 2013 when he came into Taoyuan International Airport was found a bag of narcotics in his golf bag in the check-in luggage. After being checked, the narcotics is actually heroine. It weighs up to 1380 grams and heroine is now regarded as Level 1 Narcotics in Republic of China. The prosecutor accuses you of drug trafficking. For this crime, what’s your plea?

en-US	I plead no guilty.
zh-TW	無罪辯答

zh-TW	請問你此行出發地為何？
en-US	Can I ask where did you take the flight?

en-US	I departed from Bangkok, Thailand.
zh-TW	我從泰國的曼谷出發

zh-TW	你在幾月幾日搭乘飛機？飛機航班為何？途中有無轉機?
en-US	Which date did you take the flight? What is the flight number? Do you have to transfer during the trip?

en-US	I don’t remember my flight number. I took the plane about six thirty AM.
zh-TW	我記得我的飛機是12月5號2013年，我不記得飛機的航班號碼，但是我記得我搭乘的是國泰航空，在早上七點半時起飛。我需要在香港轉機，等候轉機的時間大概是一小時又20分鐘。

zh-TW	你所帶的高爾夫球袋，是隨身行李還是託運行李？
en-US	So was your golf bag a carry-on or check-in luggage?

en-US	It was my carry-on.
zh-TW	那是我的隨身行李

zh-TW	你知道高爾夫球袋中，有幾根桿子嗎？
en-US	Did you know that how many golf sticks were there in your bag?

en-US	I don’t know a few, maybe.
zh-TW	我不知道，大概就…幾根吧!

zh-TW	那你知道球桿中藏有毒品嗎？
en-US	And did you know that in one of your golf sticks, there were actually narcotics inside?

en-US	No, I don't.
zh-TW	我不知道你面藏有毒品耶，我來之前只有人跟我說裡面有黃金

zh-TW	這高爾夫球袋是誰給你的？在哪裡給你的？
en-US	So who gave you this golf bag and where?

en-US	The name of the guy who gave me the bag was Kent. I met him in Bangkok and he hired me to work for him. I am a computer engineer. He gave me this one ball bag at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	是一個名叫肯特的人給我的。我在曼谷遇到他，他僱用我為他工作。我是一個電腦工程師，他請我幫他把袋子帶到台灣，他跟我約在曼谷的肯德基見面。

zh-TW	給你高爾夫球袋、要你把它帶入台灣的人是誰？ 你認識他嗎？知道對方的姓名嗎? 
en-US	Who gave you this golf bag and told you to bring it to Taiwan? Did you know him? Did you know his name?          

en-US	I only know him as Kent, we met earlier in March 2013.
zh-TW	我之知道他的名字叫肯特，我們是2013年的三月見面的

zh-TW	Kent是對方的姓、還是名？這是他的真名嗎？
en-US	Is Kent his surname or given name? Is it his real name?

en-US	I think that should be his real name, but I don't know what his last name is.
zh-TW	我想這是他的真名，但我不知道他姓什麼。

zh-TW	他是在哪裡把高爾夫球袋給你的？
en-US	Where did he give you the gold bag?

en-US	He asked me to meet him at a KFC in Bangkok.
zh-TW	他只跟我說我們在曼谷的一家肯德基碰面

zh-TW	你為什麼要幫他帶高爾夫球袋到台灣呢？
en-US	Why did you want to take the golf bag to Taiwan for him?

en-US	He told me that he would pay me one thousand dollars if I would bring the bag to Taiwan. I just want to make a little money and I think it's an easy job.
zh-TW	他說他要付我1000塊美元，如果我幫他把高爾夫球袋帶到台灣的話，我想要賺錢，所以覺得這是個不錯的差事。

zh-TW	你是說，對方答應要付你1000美金為酬，代價是請你把這個高爾夫球袋帶進台灣，對嗎？
en-US	Did you say that he asked to pay you 1000 US dollars as monetary compensation and you have to take the gold bag to Taiwan for him? Is that right?

en-US	Yes, he told me, I just need to bring this golf bag into Taiwan and nothing else.
zh-TW	對啊，他說我只要把高爾夫球袋帶到台灣就可以了，其他事都不用做。

zh-TW	對方有沒有告訴你，當你到了台灣之後，會怎麼樣呢？我的意思是，會有人跟你接洽嗎？
en-US	Did he ever tell you that when you arrive at Taiwan what will happen? What do you have to do next? I mean, will there be anyone to get into contact with you?

en-US	Kent told me to stay at a designated hotel and someone would call the cell phone number he had given me.
zh-TW	肯特告訴我，就待在某間飯店裡，會有人打電話跟我接洽，手機是他給我的。

zh-TW	你剛剛回答的那個手機，就是警方在桃園國際機場，扣案的那隻手機嗎？
en-US	Is this cell phone you just mentioned the one that the police officer found at Taoyuan International Airport? I mean is this the confiscated cell phone?

en-US	Yes, a Nokia phone.
zh-TW	對，就是那隻nokia的手機。

zh-TW	提示證物1，請被告確認，這支手機是不是就是你剛剛提及的那隻手機。
en-US	Now, here I’m going to show you the evidence one. Please the defendant confirm that is this cell phone you just mentioned?

en-US	Yes, this is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	對，這就是肯特給我的那支手機。

zh-TW	請問這支手機是你個人的嗎？
en-US	Is this cell phone your personal belonging?

en-US	No, this is not my own phone. This is the mobile phone Kent gave me. Kent put the SIM card into the mobile phone and gave it to me.
zh-TW	不，這不是我的手機。這是肯特給我的，他把sim 卡裝在裡面，然後給了我。

zh-TW	你是說，這支手機是委託你帶高爾夫球袋的那個人給你的嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that this cell phone was given by the one that gave you the golf bag?

en-US	Yes, he gave me this phone in KFC.
zh-TW	對，他在肯德基給我的…

zh-TW	是哪一天給你的？除了手機外，他還有給你其他東西嗎？
en-US	On which day did he give you the cell phone? In addition to the cell phone, did he give you any other things else?

en-US	He gave me this phone the day before I left Bangkok. In addition to the cell phone, he gave me $400 to cover restaurant bills and meals.
zh-TW	他在我離開曼谷前一天給我那支手機的，除了手機，他還給我400美金供我吃住。

zh-TW	那他給你手機的目的或用途為何？
en-US	So what is his intention to give you this cell phone?

en-US	He told me that he would contact me through this mobile phone. In addition, people who want to pick up golf bags will also contact me through this mobile phone.
zh-TW	他告訴我他會用這支手機連絡我，還有那個要跟我拿包包的人也會用這支手機跟我聯絡

zh-TW	也就是說，當你拿這支手機進入台灣，會有人打電話跟你聯絡，再跟你碰面拿高爾夫球袋嗎？
en-US	which means that when you took this cell phone into Taiwan, someone will call you, meet you up and take the golf bag?

en-US	Yes, Kent told me, someone was going to contact me and meet me to take the bag.
zh-TW	對，肯特跟我說當我到台灣的時候，就會有人打電話給我跟我拿高爾夫球袋

zh-TW	那你知道跟你聯絡的人會是誰嗎？
en-US	Do you know that who will get into contact with you?

en-US	No, I don't know who's going to call me.
zh-TW	不，我不知道誰會打給我

zh-TW	你剛剛還回答到，委託你的人除了手機之外，也給了你美金400元，這算是酬勞嗎？
en-US	You just answered that the one gave you the cell phone will also give you 400 US dollars. Will this count as monetary compensation?

en-US	I figured it was just paying my hotel bills and meals.
zh-TW	我想這筆錢應該就是提供我吃住吧

zh-TW	所以，除了這400元之外，當你成功的回到泰國後，你還會再拿到1000美金的意思嗎？
en-US	so besides these 400 dollars, when you get back to Thailand successfully, you will get another 1000 US dollars. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, that's what I learned. Yes, when I bring the bag into Taiwan, and then come back to Bangkok, I will get another thousand dollars.
zh-TW	對我是這麼想的。在我把高爾夫球袋給指定的人之後，可以回到泰國，並且拿到1000塊美金。

zh-TW	所以當初你接受這份委託時，就知道帶的是海洛因嗎?
en-US	So when you accepted this case, did you know that what you brought is actually heroine? 

en-US	No, I really didn't know that heroin was hidden inside the club.
zh-TW	不不不不不，我根本就不知道裡面是海洛因

zh-TW	你不覺得，如果只是請你帶黃金入台灣，這個代價，也就是1000美金，有點高嗎？
en-US	don’t you think that if he just wants you to bring gold into Taiwan, this price, I mean 1000 US dollars is a bit too high?

en-US	I don't know if that's too much, I just want to make a little extra money.
zh-TW	我不管他給我多少錢，我只是想要賺錢而已

zh-TW	你有沒有想過，為什麼那個人不要自己帶來呢？
en-US	 Have you ever thought about why didn’t the person just bring the gold by himself?

en-US	Kent told me he was busy and wanted someone to help him.
zh-TW	肯特只是告訴我他很忙，他需要有人幫他

zh-TW	就算高爾夫球袋裡面，真的是黃金，你也應該知道，攜帶黃金入境，也可能是違法的，不是嗎？
en-US	even though you know that in the golf bag was actually gold, you should have known that bringing gold into Taiwan it may be against the law, isn’t it?

en-US	I only know that gold is cheaper in Thailand, I don't know if it is illegal to bring gold into Taiwan.
zh-TW	我只知道黃金在泰國的確是比較便宜，但我不知道戴黃金進入台灣是不是違法的

zh-TW	你為什麼會覺得，帶黃金不會有問題呢？
en-US	Why do you think that bringing gold into Taiwan won’t have any problem?

en-US	Gold is gold, no big deal, no?
zh-TW	黃金就是黃金，應該沒什麼大問題吧，不是嗎?

zh-TW	你在拿袋子的時候，有檢查過裡面的貨品嗎？
en-US	When you took the bag, did you check what is inside?

en-US	No, I didn't because that bag was sealed. I don't think I can open a bag.
zh-TW	我沒有查，因為袋子封起來了，我不覺得我應該打開它

zh-TW	你就這麼信任對方，不覺得有可能受騙嗎？ 
en-US	You trusted him so deeply, didn’t you think that you might be conned?

en-US	When I met Kent in March, there was a possibility that we would become work mates later on. So I think I can work for him, he is a good guy and won't lie to me.
zh-TW	我和肯特是在三月見面的，所以我們可能成為夥伴啊，之後可能還需要替他工作呢。我覺得他看起來人蠻好的，我不覺得他會騙我啊

zh-TW	你的意思是說，對方有表達想要跟你一起合作生意，所以你才不疑有他嗎？
en-US	so do you mean that he said that he wanted to cooperate with you so that’s why you didn’t suspect him, right?

en-US	Yeah, so that's why I trust him so much.
zh-TW	對，我覺得我們之後會一起工作，所以我才這麼信任他

zh-TW	除了剛剛所回答的問題之外，你還有什麼想要追加陳述的嗎？有沒有希望法院進一步調查的證據？
en-US	in addition to the questions you had answered, do you have any other thing to add? Do you have anything that want the court to further investigate?

en-US	I'm really sorry for what happened, I don't know what was hidden in the bag, he told me it was gold, if I knew it was heroin, I really wouldn't bring this bag to Taiwan. Please forgive me.
zh-TW	我真的對這件事情深感懊悔，我真的不知道袋子裡有什麼。我只知道裡面是黃金，如果我知道裡面裝的是海洛因，我就不會把他帶到台灣了，請你原諒我

zh-TW	除了Kent之外，你有比較具體、可幫助警方查到委託你的人是誰的細節嗎？ 
en-US	So besides Kent, do you have any other concrete or more helpful evidence to help the police to find the one who asked you for this job? 

en-US	All I have is the cell phone Kent gave me.
zh-TW	我只有他給我的那支手機

zh-TW	目前你在羈押中，有沒有希望我們代為通知的人？
en-US	Now you are in detention, do you have anyone that you want us to notify for you?

en-US	Can you help me contact my family in Bangkok, or my kids in England? They must be worried about me, I was supposed to go back to Bangkok at the end of December.
zh-TW	你可以幫我聯絡我在曼谷的家人嗎? 還有我在英國的孩子們。他們現在一定很擔心我，我本來預計在十二月底時會到曼谷的

zh-TW	下一次出庭會是審理程序，你可以選任辯護人，選任之後，辯護人可以跟你進行會面、了解案情，明白嗎？如有必要的話，辯護人可以代為連絡你的家人。 
en-US	Our next court will be the trial procedure. You can choose your lawyer and when you decide the lawyer, the lawyer will meet you and understand the whole case. Do you understand?

en-US	Yes, I understand.
en-US	If it’s necessary, the lawyer can help you contact your family for you as well. 

zh-TW	檢察官有沒有需要進一步調查的證據？
en-US	And prosecutor, do you have any further evidence to investigate?

zh-TW	如卷所示。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	準備程序到此結束，訂中華民國103年4月9日早上10點40分進行審理程序。

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	I’m going to inform you your rights and obligations.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	First, you have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民或其他符合法律規定之資格，得請求法律服務。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	do you fully understand your 

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是我了解了

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for adultery. The plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case of today. It’s mainly because her husband John Anderson has an intimate relation with one of the teacher in the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. Plus, the defendant usually tends to go home late and has close relation with Tsai Yen Wang in the cram school and even had video telephoning. The plaintiff found that everything proves that her husband and his coworker are actually beyond coworker’s relationship. That’s why the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, your wife suspects you of committing adultery. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然無罪啊

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	For today’s preparatory procedure, we are mainly here for the contents of those intimate messages. In order to figure out whether the defendant really has adultery with his coworker. Do both parties understand the procedures?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	I have questions for the plaintiff. How long have you been married to your husband? Do you have any children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	My husband and I have married for four years and we don’t have any children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you and your husband get married in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met in Taiwan. Four years ago he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in the past few years, your husband’s work in Taiwan was teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	Well, when we just met he was an Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued to teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular foreign language to learn in Taiwan so his teaching hours were quite unstable. Sometimes he might have a period between jobs. This period can be long to a month. Afterwards, in order to make his income more stable, he started to teach English. But because his mother tongue is not English, he decides to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. Does this mean a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan so that degree must be related to English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California for teaching English. He doesn’t have to go to America but still can have the courses by on-line learning. In this case, after he finishes all the courses he can get a master degree. His plan is through this degree he got from the United States he can get a job in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s his relationship with this woman that he commits the adultery?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues in cram school. The cram school arranges he to partner with somebody, a Taiwanese, and that woman was his partner. 

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know that they have adultery?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first I just found out that my husband stayed quite long after work in the cram school. I have asked him several times that it’s just an English cram school, why did you need to stay so long after work in the cram school? He told me that because he had to partner with a Taiwanese so that they needed a lot of time to communicate and discuss about the course. At the very beginning, I really didn’t suspect him of anything. After I found out he got some phone calls quite often after work and when he received the call, he couldn’t speak in front of me. He always went to the study room. It started to make me curious so I began to check his phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything unusual in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I saw that in his phone book I saw a number quite often. Because of that, I was curious again and started to check his messages. After the checking I found that he had messages of the same woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	They are just some messages, or are there any problems with the messages?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If they are just some normal messages then it’s okay. But he’s a married man, how could he receive some intimate messages from others. Before, I did offer some contents of the messages to the court. They should already been included in the documents. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please show the evidence record, page number 13. There are few messages. Please the defendant have a look. Are these messages from your phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對，這是我手機裡的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	I have few questions concerning these messages for you. The first message was at 9:50 on the date 31st November in 2002 from the cellphone number 0958932xxx. The contents were “I really miss you my love.” What did that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	喔，這只是我一個同事傳給我的，我記得我那時候大概放了兩天假吧，她大概是有點擔心，這就是為什麼她傳給我這封簡訊啊。我的同事她在美國受教育所以她算是心胸鰻寬闊的，這就是她說話的方式還有自我表現的方式。至於「my love」這個字，只是用來稱呼一些我們關心的人

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that because this colleague has spent some time in the united states, her thought was kind of westernized and her way of expressing herself was quite open as well. So “my love” means nothing special, is that right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	不是，這只是一個很平常的稱呼而已，就是用來稱呼我們在乎的人。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	what about the sentence before

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	我剛剛講過了，她很擔心我，我們是工作上面的同事，當我沒去工作兩天，她當然會想我啊。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean she’s just because you hadn’t been to work for two days, that’s why she sent you this message; because without your assistance in the class so she misses you? Is that all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對，這就是簡訊的內容，這沒有什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second text was at 11:55pm on 13rd January in 2003. This message was from the same number as the first one. The content was “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together我希望你在我身邊 我們什麼時候才能真正在一起呢”. What does this message mean? Why is it possible to have this kind of contexts?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫給我這句話是因為想告訴我一個課本上面出現的句子。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Do you mean she send you this message because she wants you help from the text book? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	因為我太太幫我申請這個課程，所以我有一個線上教學的課程。在這個課程裡我需要修滿30個學分才可以拿到學位。當然我會需要完成一些練習啊，還有作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you please explain what’s your master degree about?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程是英語教學，這個課程裡爸都是跟英語教學有關的，但有些其他課程是跟文化還有語言能力相關。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So the master degree is mainly about English teaching but there are some courses about language competence and culture, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，我記得大概有三門課都和文化還有溝通相關吧。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So how do the courses related to communication? What kind of assignments they gave you?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	關於文化與溝通的作業呢，針對每個學生都是不一樣的，以我自己為例，我是一個在台灣想獲得英語教學資格的人，為了達成這個要求，我需要符合一些資格，必須要具備一定的中文能力，所以我有一些作業都是中文和英語之間的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan so you have to prove yourself with enough Chinese competence, is that right? Thus, you have to finish some assignments from the course and these assignments are translation between English and Chinese. Is that true?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對，就是這樣，我真的很想增進自己的寫作能力還有說的能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to what we discussed before that it’s your assignment right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我記得這個句子啊，當我拿到這個中文句子的時候，我實在不知道怎麼樣用英文表達，你們都知道吧，有些中文字對外國人來說真的很難。我需要一些幫助，所以像我同事求救，我請她翻譯這個句子然後用簡訊傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You meant that you sent her the Chinese sentence and she sent you back the English translation of that sentence. So this message was just the answer for your assignments?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，這封簡訊就只是我作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Again, let’s have a look at the record from page 14 to 16. Here are some contents of the messages. Please have a careful look at the contents. Were all of these the answers of your assignments so that she sent you these messages?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，全部的簡訊都是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	what’s your explanation for your wife’s suspect of you having adultery with your colleague Tsai yen Wang?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了啦，我知道她對我對這個家的貢獻不太滿意，我希望庭上了解，在我開始修這個遠距課程的時候，她就沒有提供我任何課業上的幫助，她根本一點都不想幫我完成這個學位，如果她當初願意多幫助我一些，我就不用像我同事尋求協助啦，我覺得他應該要為這一切、這個事件負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to you saying, it seems that you and your wife are not getting along too well, right?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們一開始結婚的時候，的確是處的蠻不錯的，但問題是在於我失業了，剛我想在台灣教葡萄牙語但工作時數很不穩定，所以我工作的問題就變成我們倆爭執的來源，我們常常為了這個問題吵架，她不相信我已經盡力了，我實在無法讓她了解我現在這個時期有多痛苦多難熬。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to the master degree we just discussed. When did you start the master degree? Has it ended already? When will you get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始上這個課，這個課程是兩年制，我應該要在2012年年底完成。我沒有辦法完成這個學位，因為我一邊上課一邊工作，沒有時間完成所有的作業。我剛剛前面有說過了，我太太完全不想幫忙，我覺得我好像一個人孤身奮戰想取得這個學位，我變得很累而且很沮喪。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean that it’s a two-year course but you didn’t finish it at the end. Why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When did you last register for the courses? When will it end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	上一次註冊的課程是在2012年秋季班。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	According to what you just mentioned, the last day of your course will be December 5th, 2012 so after that you shouldn’t have any more assignments right? But the messages were actually six months after the course ended. What’s your explanation?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我可能的確是沒有完成這個課程啦，但這不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。即使我沒有辦法取得學位，但我持續想精進我的中文能力，這就是為什麼我還是繼續練習啊

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You what you meant is that even you couldn’t get the degree, you still want to continue learning Chinese to make it become more fluent. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，這就是我向我同事尋求協助的原因

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleague is actually serving as a tutor for you right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是像一個家教還是一個真正的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	我曾經想付錢給她，但她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why did she need to send you messages that it’s the time that she should already fall into sleep? Wasn’t that beyond what a colleague should do?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個真的想幫忙我的朋友啊，她用她自己的時間來幫我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still at the same cram school teaching English?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對 我還在那裏工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	What about the colleague Tsai yen Wang? Is she still there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	對，她還在這家補習班任職，但是我們不再是搭檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any further evidence to investigate?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena Tsai yen Wang who teaches in Powen cram school to come to the court to give us some information. I would like her to clarify her relationship with the defendant and the background of writing all these messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Does the plaintiff have any evidence that want us to investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I’ve heard that the cram school had some actions according to the relation between my husband and that woman. In that discussion, they also mentioned the unemployment of tsai yen wang. I wander if I can ask evidences from the cram school. 

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you want the court to find any evidence for you? Now the fact is that your master course has already ended on December 5th in 2012. You have no right to blame all these messages on completing the assignments. Especially that all your messages were sent after 9pm. This is really doubting. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到任何可以請庭上幫我調查的證據，我剛剛說過了，我和我同事之間的關係真的非常的簡單，我真的只是想增進我的中文能力然後繼續學習中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court day will be 4:30pm on June 9th in 2014 for the inquiry procedure of witness. The plaintiff and the defendant both have to show up. If necessary, both parties can hire lawyers. 

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	 I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	This is the end of the court today. 

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	Today we are here for crime…for …….

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國103年5月27日。」

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your right?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是我了解

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are going to process the procedure of adultery case. The plaintiff Cheng Yu Hua suit the case.The reason why is that the Cheng Yu Hua’s husband has intimate with his colleague in the cram school. And plaintiff found some intimate message from her husband’s cell phone.Plus, her husband often makes up reason for working and using tele-conferencing with Wan Tsai Yian at night. The information gathered by the plaintiff prove that it has beyond co-worker relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed the case. Defendant, your wife sues you the adultery, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我做無罪答辯

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In  today preparation procedure, we will mainly focus on the message from the defendant and Wan Tsai Hua. The purpose of the procedure is to verified that there is any evidence to prove that the defendant and Wan Tsai Hua have adultery case. Do both  party understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you been married with your husband?Do you have a kid?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have married for four years, and we don’t have children

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	So you and your husband get married  in the foreign country or in Taiwan?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I meet my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he went to Taiwan because he want to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In past few year, is his job mainly focus on teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese. After we get married, he still teach the Portuguese.Since Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hour is not very stable. Sometimes there are a few months between the two cases.So he want to increase his income, he decided to teach English.However, his mother’s tongue is not English, so he decided to seek advance degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he decided to seek a advance degree.You mean he decided to get the degree?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He want to teach english in Taiwan, so he have to get the degree related to english teaching.He found a distance learning progress on internet, and it is in California. He can go to the class without going to America. After he get all the….. he can get the master degree.In his plan is that through this project, after he finished his degree, he can teach english in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What is the relationship between your husband and the person who he has affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleague in the cram school.That  cram school arrange partner for teaching, and his partner is….that girl.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know they have adultery?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	First I noticed that my husband always stayed at cram school, working late.I asked him for many time that it is only a english cram school, there is no necessary to do extra works.He told me that since he had partner with a chinese teacher, so he have to spend some time to do the teaching plan. At first time, I really didn’t doubt him. Then, I noticed that after he came back home, there are some strange phone calls. And when he picked up the phone, he will go to the room and talk on the phone instead of in front of me. It makes me suspect him, so I check his cell phone. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Do you see any unusual thing in the cell phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, there is a same number appeared oftenly. So I check his message box.After that I found that he almost have contact with a same woman almost everyday.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	 It is only some message. Is there any inappropriate information or context?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it is just a normal message, that is okay.But he is already a married man, how can he let another woman to send some intimate message?I have already filed some of the message to the court previously. It should be contained in the filed.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please show the investigation file on page thirteen.There are some of the message in the cell phone.Defendant, please check the message. Are these message in your cell phone.

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這些是我的簡訊內容。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	So I will ask some question based on these message. The first message is sent from nine fifty, november thirty first, 2011. And it’s from 0958-932xxx. The context is I really miss you, my love. What does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是同事寄給我的。我還記得那個時候我請兩天休假。她可能有點擔心，所以她就傳這個簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國接受教育的，所以她思想開放，這就是他說話的風格。至於愛人這個字，只不過是要表達對他人關心的意思。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that person have education in the foreign country, so she has much more western style mind, is that right?And her expression of feeling is much more open minded, right?Therefore the word my love have not any mean, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	當然沒有阿，這個字只是用來跟老朋友關心的用語。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the previous sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的，我們只不過是同事而已，我們在工作上是同事。我離開兩天，她自然會想我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean because you took two days off, so your colleague worried about you. Without your assistance in the class, so she missed you, is that truth?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對這就是簡訊內容阿，簡訊本身沒有什麼。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message is at eleven fifty five pm, january thirteen, 2012. It’s from the same cell phone.The detail of message is 「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」.Can you tell me what is the mean of the sentence?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這句話是因為說他想幫我表達這句中文的意思。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean she sent you this message because she want to help you with your assignment.Is that truth?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像他們說的，我現在正在完成一篇論文。因此我必須要完成十三個學分，我才能正式完成我的學位。那當然我必須要完成一些指定的作業...

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain what’s your graduated school’s degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程是英語教學。在這些課程裡面，有些是英語上的教學，有些是牽涉到文化的部份。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	You mean that your have TESOL for your master degree, and there are some cross..related …….is that what your mean?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	我至少有三個課程關於文化還有溝通的部份。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	In this course, what kind of assignment did this course provide you?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這堂課給每個學生的作業可能都不一樣。對我來說好了，我在台灣想要尋求一個英語教學的工作。為了要展現出我的足夠的能力可以勝任這個工作，因此我必須要有良好的中文能力。所以我有很多的作業都是中英翻譯的。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean that since you want to teach english in Taiwan, so you have to get the English degree. And this degree required you to have competence of english and chinese. Is that right? So you have to finished some of the assignment for the class, and the context of this work is to translate these sentence.

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	當然啦，我還被要求說要加強我的口說還有寫作。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So let’s back to the message, that is your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的我還記得那句話。當我看到那句中文時，我無法翻成英文。你也知道有些中文字對於外國人很難辨認。我需要一些幫助，所以我叫我的同事幫我。所以我請她翻完之後把答案傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean that you asked your colleague to translate that sentence and she will send the answer back to you, is that what you mean?In other word, this message is the answer of your assignment.

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊就只是我功課上的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	And now we’ll show you the investigatory file from page fourteen to sixteen,please see all the message on these pages. Please check these messages. Is these message that she want to help you with your assignment?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊都是她為了要幫我完成作業而傳給我的。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So for your wife, you have the affair with your colleague Wan Tsai Yian. What’s your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我的太太真的想太多了。我知道她可能不太滿意我在家中沒有扮演支持上的角色。我想到的是說在我剛開始念書的時候，她從來沒有表現出支持我的意思。她根本就不想要幫我完成這個學業。如果她肯幫助我的話，那我根本就不需要問我的同事阿！我覺得她要為這些誤會負所有的責任。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you said, there seem to be some trouble between you and your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在剛開始結婚的時候，我們的確有一段甜蜜的時光。可是問題是在於我的工作。我想要再台灣教葡萄牙文，但我的工時並不穩定。然後我們的工作就變成我們吵架的理由。我們常常為了這件事情不停的吵架。她不相信我已經全力以赴了。她根本也不了解我我面臨了多艱困的處境。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s back to the master degree course. When is your course begin? when do you graduate?Do you get your master degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年春天開始上課的。那是一個兩年的課程。我應該要在2012年的十二月就要完成了。我並沒有完成是因為說我還要工作，所以我沒有時間完成這些作業。就像我說的，我的太太並不支持我。我覺得我只能孤軍奮戰，自己去解決那些問題。我覺得我太受挫折，而且我也很累了。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean it’s a two year project program, and you didn’t finish it. Can you tell me why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有完成那些作業。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	So when is your last registration semester over?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後...是在2012年的秋天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So you mean that after 2011, december fifth, you should not have any assignment after your last registration date, is that right? But you and your colleague still send the message after six month.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	就算我已經完成了這些作業了，並不代表我不想繼續增進我的語文能力。就算我沒有拿到碩士學位，但是我還是想要繼續增進我的中文能力阿。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even though you didn’t finish that program, you still want to improve your language ability, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，這就是為什麼我找我的同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleague play the role of a teacher for you.

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是個助教，而且是個真心的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我想要付她錢，但是被她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why did her send you message at midnight for your work? Is that a little bit beyond the relationship between the colleague?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我就說她是一個一個很支持我的朋友。她都用她自己的時間來幫我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach english in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對我還在那邊工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So your colleague Wan Tsai Yian, did she still work there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她還在那邊工作，不過我們也不再是夥伴的關係。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any requirement for further investigation or the further evidence you want to investigate?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena Wan Tsai Yian, who works in Bo Yuan cram school as a witness. I want her to….. the relationship between her and defendant. And I want to ask her about the context in the message.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	For defendant, do you have any evidence which want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	 I’ve heard that cram school have do something for there relationship. And even the cram school asked Wan Tsai Yian to leave the job. I wonder we can ask the cram school about this thing.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate for you? The situation is that your course is already ended at december fifth, 2012.There is no reason that you still doing your assignment. Furthermore, you and Wan Tsai Yian send the message after nine o’clock pm, it makes people suspect.Do you have evidence that may help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我覺得我找不到任何證據可以讓法庭幫我。就像我說的，我跟我同事之間的關係就是這麼簡單，我只是想要繼續增進我的中文能力而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So the court set that at four thirty pm, june ninth 2012, we will arrange the court for questioning procedure. The plaintiff and defendant both have to come to the court at that day. If necessary, both side can have a lawyer, do you understand? 

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是我了解

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Today procedure dismissed

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

en-US	You have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you with your case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of adultery case. The plaintiff Chen Yu-Hua filed the case. It’s mainly because her husband John Anderson had close interaction with his colleague in cram school. The plaintiff discovered come intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. Also her husband would make up reasons for working late and had tele- conference with his colleague Wang Tsai-Yen. The evidence the plaintiff collected has beyond coworkers’ relationship. Therefore, she filed the case. The defendant, you are suspected of adultery, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
en-US	我沒有罪

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In the preparatory procedure today, we are mainly going to talk about the details of the interaction between the defendant and his coworker. And the purpose is to clarify whether the defendant and his colleague’s interaction constitutes of adultery. Do both parties understand the procedure? 

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	 I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you married your husband? Do you have kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have married for four years and we don’t have a kid.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met in Taiwan. Four years ago, he just got to Taiwan and wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in the past few years, his job is Taiwan was mainly teaching Portuguese, right?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a teacher who taught Portuguese. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hours was not stable. Sometime, the period between jobs may be one or two months. So in order to get a more stable job, he decided to teach English. However, English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree; you mean he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to get a degree about TESOL. He found a distance learning program online which was in California. Therefore, he didn’t have to go to the USA but could get a distant learning. So that after he finished all the courses, he could get the degree. His plain was that with this degree, he could get an English teaching job in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what kind of the relationship between your husband and the person he had an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in the cram school. The cram school arranges a partner-teaching system, which contains a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher. And she as her partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	Then how do you know they had affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I noticed that my husband often worked late in cram school. I’ve asked him many times, it was just an English cram school; why would he work so late? And he told me that he had to teach with his partner teacher so he has to cooperate with each other. At first, I trusted him. However, I discovered that he often got phone calls after he got home. And he never answered the phone in front of me; he would go to the study room to answer. This made me start to suspect him, so I checked his phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So did you see any unusual thing in his phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	There was one number that often showed on his dialed record. So I went to check hos text message. After that I found that he texted with a woman nearly every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	If it’s was text, then it not a big deal, right? Was the content suspectful? 

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	It’s okay if it was just normal text. However, he is a married man, how could he let a woman to send that kind of message to him. I have provided some of contents to the court. I think it’s in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Let’s see page thirteen of the file. Defendant, please check the text content. Are these the text message from your phone? 

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對這是我手機裡的簡

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Based on these messages, I will ask you some questions. The first one was sent on at 9:50pm on thirty first in November from number 0958-932xxx, the content was “I really miss you, my love,”…..

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	恩,她是我同事 我記得那個時候我休了兩天假 她很擔心我 所以她才會傳這封簡訊給我 我同事是在美國受教育的 她的思想很開放 這是她說話跟表達的方式  至於{我的愛}只是我們對關心的人的稱謂

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean the one who sent this was westernized because she studied in the United States, right? And she’s more opened in expressing her emotion? So the words ”my love” means nothing right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	這是對老朋友的一種表達方式而已

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the previous sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的 她擔心我啊 我們是工作夥伴 我兩天沒有去上班 她當然會想我

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean she sent this kind of message to you was just because you didn’t go to work for two days? Without your assistance in class, and she missed you? Is that all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對阿 就這樣啊 沒什麼大不了的

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Okay, then the second text was sent at 11:55pm on January 13th in 2013 from the same cellphone, the content was 「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」, can you tell me what this meant

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳這封簡訊給我是要教我中文作業要怎麼表達

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean the reason why she sent this to you was to help you with your assignment? What is that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太說的 我在進修 要得到學位的話我必須要休30個學分 而當然我就有一些作業跟練習

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain what you are studying in your master program?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我修的是英語教學 在這個學位中 有一部份是英語教學 也有文化語言能力的部分

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you are studying the degree of TESOL, and there are some courses about culture, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對阿我記得至少三堂課都跟文化溝通有關

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So the so-called culture communication course would give you what kind of assignments?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這種課所給的作業因學生而異 拿我自己來說 我現在在台灣而且想要找一個英語教學的工作 為了要達到我必須要證明我有足夠的語言能力 所以我的作業很多都是中英文句子的轉換

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean because you plan to teach in Taiwan, so have to show your Chinese competent, right? So you have to do some assignment in the course, which contains the translation between Chinese and English, right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對阿 我也需要加強我的口說及寫作能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So back to the previous sentence, this was your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對阿 我還記得這句 當我看到這個中文的時候 不知道英文怎麼多 你知道中文字對外國人來說很難辨別 我需要一點幫助 所以我才請我同事幫我 我叫他幫我翻譯然後把答案傳給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean the condition at that time was that you gave the Chinese sentence to your co-worker and asked her to tell you in English, right? That is, the content in the text was just the answer for your assignment, righ

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對 這封簡訊就只是我作業的答案而已

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	And now please check page 14 to 16, the evidence one. Please check the content. Were these all because of your assignment?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對 所有的簡訊都是為了幫助我完成作業才傳的

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So, about the law suit which accuse you of having an affair with Wang Tsai-Yen, what’s your explanation? 

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我老婆真的想太多了 我知道他對我負擔家計的程度感到不滿 我想讓法院知道的是 他對於我要進修沒有表示任何的支持 他不願意幫助我完成學業 如果他願意幫助我的話 我就不用請我同事來幫我了 我覺得他對於這些誤會應該要負全部的責任

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, there seems to be some unhappy things between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	剛結婚的時候 真的很開心 但是問題是我的工作 我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文 可是卻沒有辦法獲得足夠的工作時數 所以我的工作就變成我們兩個之間的問題 我們為此一直吵架 他不相信我有努力 而且他對於我的挫折還有困境完全不了解

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, then back to the master program. When did you start it? Are you done with it? Did you get the degree yet?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年春天開始修這個學位 這是一個兩年的課程 我本來應該要在2012年12月完成 可是我沒有完成因為我還有工作所以沒有足夠的時間寫作業  就像我剛剛說過的 我老婆從來不支持我 我覺得在追求學位的路上很孤單 我就變得很累也很挫折

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean the course was supposed to a two-year program, and you didn’t finish it, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	因為我沒有辦法完成所有的課程要求

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	So when was the last registered-semester ended?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一個註冊的學期是2101年秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you said, if the last day of the semester was 5th December, 2012, there shouldn’t be any further assignments, right? However, the text between you and your colleague proceeded for 6 month after that, why is that? 

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒有完成學位也不代表我不想增進我的語文能力阿 就算我沒有拿到學位我也想要增進我的中文 所以我還是自己繼續念

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean despite the failing of the course, you still wanted to improve your Chinese ability, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對阿 所以我請我同事幫忙

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleague was just like your tutor, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不只像我的家教 也是我真心的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有 我有跟他說過要付他錢 可是他拒絕

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, then why would she send text to you at night when it was supposed to sleep? Doesn’t that do beyond the relationship between coworker?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以這是為什麼我會說他是一個很好的朋友 他拿自己的時間來教我中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對我還在那工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So does she still work there, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	對阿 他也還在那邊工作 可是我們現在不是搭檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, does there any evidence you want to further investigate?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena Wang Tsai-Yen who works at Bo-Yuan cram school as witness. And ask her to elaborate the relationship between them, and the background of those texts.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there any evidence you want to course to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had taken some measures about the relationship between them. And I heard that the cram school tried to persuade her to quit the job. Is it possible to verify it to the cram school? 

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? The situation now is that your master program has ended, so it should not be taken as an excuse for the interaction between you and Wang Tsai-Yen. Especially, your interaction was always after 9pm, I think it suspectful. Do you have any evidence that may help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不出法院可以幫我偵查什麼耶 就像我之前說的 我們之間的互動是很單純的 我只是想要增進我的語言能力繼續學中文

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So the court will set the next court on June 9th in 2014 for witness procedure. Both of you have to be there. If it’s necessary, both of you can have lawyers. Do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的我知道了

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparing procedure of the adultery case. Yu-Hua Chen file the lawsuit for this case. Because of the intimate relationship between his husband Mr. Anderson and his co-worker. The plaintiff found some intimate messages from his co-worker in his cellphone. Also, Mr. Anderson sometimes has the tele-conferencing with his co-worker, and over-time work in the midnight. The evidence which the plaintiff research are beyond co-worker relationship. Therefore, she filed the lawsuit. Defendant, what’s your plea for your wife’s lawsuit against you?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
en-US	 我覺得我無罪，當然。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s procedure, we mainly discuss the details about the intimate messages. That is mainly for to investigate there is an affair or not, that constitute adultery case. Do both of you understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	 I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long do you marry to your husband? Do you have kid?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	I’ve married to my husband for 4 years but we don’t have kid.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you marry to your husband in Taiwan? Or other place?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	Is his job teaching Portuguese for past years?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	The time we just met, he was a Portuguese teacher. And he still kept teaching Portuguese when we just married. But there’s not many people want to learn Portuguese so his teaching hours was not stable. Sometime the period between jobs would be one or two months. To make the income more stable, he started to teach English. But English is not his mother tongue, he decided to take an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned he wanted to seek an advanced degree, is that mean he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he need to get a TESOL degree. He found a distance learning from California, U.S. so that he doesn’t need to go to California, U.S. but get the degree by the distance learning program. His plan is to get the English teacher job by the American degree.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in cram school. They are partner. One is foreign teacher, one is mandarin teacher. The person he has an affair with is the mandarin teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know that they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	In the beginning, I just noticed my husband stayed in cram school over-time. I asked him for several times why have to work over-time in English cram school? He told me that he had to communicate with his partner. I didn’t doubt him at the beginning. But I found that he sometimes had some call after he finish his job. He didn’t talk in front of me. He would talk in his study room. That made me start doubting so I went check his phone

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	What’s the unusual in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	There are usually the same number shows up in his phone book. I was so curious so I go check his messages. And I found out that he message with a woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	I don’t think text messages matter. Was there any unusual content?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If that just usual message, that is okay. But he is married, how can he have intimate messages with another woman? I’ve provided some text messages and I think it’s in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	In the file one, page thirteen. Here are some message content for the defendant. Are those the messages in your phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的這些都是我手機裡的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I’m going to ask you some questions for the messages. The first messages is 9:50 PM, November thirty-first, 2012, from number 0958932xxx to your cellphone. The content is “我真的很想你，我的愛。” What is that?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我同事傳給我的啊。我記得我那時候休了兩天假，她那時有點焦慮。所以她才發給我這樣的簡訊。我同事是在美國念過書所以她很開放，那是她表達的方式。至於我的愛這句話，這是我們稱呼我們所在乎的人的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean she text you because she was westernized for being educated in U.S.? She is more open minded to express, so “my love” doesn’t mean any special?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	沒啊這就只是好朋友老朋友之間互相表達我們很在乎對方。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about former sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我講的 她有點擔心，因為我們是工作上的搭檔啊。當我兩天沒上班她當然會想念我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean you text you that kind of message just because you had two days off? She missed you because of without you in the class? Just that

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊就只是這樣啊。對啊就跟內容講的一樣啊這根本就沒甚麼。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message is at 23:55 PM, January thirteenth, 2013, from the same number to your phone. The content is “我真的好希望你在我身邊，為什麼我們不能真正的在一起?” What does that mean? Why the content?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她之所以會傳給我這樣的簡訊主要是為了表達中文句子。這是我的作業。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean she text you the message just for helping you the assignment? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我老婆告訴庭上的。我開始了這個遠距教學程，在這遠距教學課程裡我得完成30個學分。自然，我需要完成一些功課與習題。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
zh-TW	Can you explain what is your master degree for?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
en-US	我的課程主要是英語教學。在課程裡，大部分是英語教學的部分，其他則是文化及語言能力相關。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you mean you get the TESOL degree, but there’re some courses about cross-culture communication?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	我記得大概有三棵是關於跨文化溝通課程。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What’s the assignment in cross-culture communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	每個學生的作業都不太一樣，拿我舉例來說，我人在台灣，尋求教師資格，為了顯示我有這個這個能力勝任教師，所以有很多是關於中英語句的翻譯轉換。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean to get the degree you have to prove that you have Chinese competence, so you have to complete the assignment in the course. And the assignment is to translate sentences? Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對啊當然，而且我還得加強我的說和寫的能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay let’s back to the former sentence, you said that is your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對啊我還記得那句，當我知道中文句子時，我不知道如何變成英文。你懂的，有些中文對外國人而言實在很難分辨差別。我實在需要幫忙所以我找了我的同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯並傳簡訊給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Your mean you told your colleague that Chinese sentence so she text it into English and send it to you? That’s only the answer to your assignment

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊就真的只是作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Messages in file one, page 14 to 16. Please have a look. Are those message also the help for your assignment?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的所有簡訊都是為了完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So what’s your explanation for your wife said that you have an affair with your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了。我知道她對於我對家計的幫助一直很不滿意。我必須告訴庭上，從一開始修這門課，她就沒表現任何想支持我的意思。她根本就不想幫助我完成這個學位，如果她表現出她有點想幫助我的樣子，我就不會想請我同事幫助我。我覺得這一切的誤會都得怪她。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	As you just said, there are some unhappy between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	一開始我們剛結婚時的確還滿快樂的，但問題在於我的工作。我試著在台灣交葡萄牙語但我的工時實在太不穩定了。所以我的工作成為我們的大問題，我們為了這個問題一直爭吵，她一直不相信我的努力。我也沒辦法讓她明白我的艱困處境及我的沮喪。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s back to the degree issue. When did your advanced degree start? Did that finished? Did you get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我大概是2010年春天開始的，這是兩年期的課程。我應該在2012年的12月完成這門課程。但我並沒有如期完成因為我有兼職要做而且我也沒有完成這門課的作業。就像我講的，我老婆一點都不想幫

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You said that program is for two years, but you didn’t complete, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成所有課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When does the last semester you registered complete?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊在學的最後一個學期事2012年的秋季。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	 If what you said is true, your semester finished on December fifth, 2012, that you would not have any assignment after that semester, right? But the text messages between 

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我雖然沒有完成這門課程，但不代表我就不想精進我的語言能力。就算我沒有得到我的學位，我還是想要我的中文能力進步，所以我持續自行學習。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean though you didn’t complete the degree, you still want to improve your language competence to make your Chinese more fluently?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	是的這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫我。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the position that your colleague is your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不僅是家教也是我的好朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有啊我原本想付錢給她但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her why she still text you in midnight the bed time for answering your questions? Don’t you think that is beyond the co-worker relationship

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	就像我剛剛講過的，她是一個非常支持我的好朋友。她用她自己的時間幫助我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still work in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是的我仍在那邊任教。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is the co-worker, Tsai-Yen Wang still working there, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她仍在那邊工作但我們不再是搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any person you want to subpoena or investigate any further evidence?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena Tsai-Yen Wang, who was the co-worker in BoYuan cram school to clarify the relationship between the defendant and those messages. 

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, do you want the court to investigate for you

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	 I’ve heard that cram school took some action for the relationship between my husband and her. Also I heard the cram school tried to persuade Tsai-Yen Wang to quit. Can we modify it from the cram school?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	 Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you? The situation is, your degree finished on December fifth, 2012. You don’t have any reason to explain the intimate messages between you and Miss Wang. Especially, the message communication is mainly after 9PM, it’s very doubtful. Do you have any evidence which can help you?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我覺得我的行為已經夠可以表現出我的清白了。就像我說的，我跟我同事間的簡訊來往是非常單純的。我只是想增進我的中文能力並持續的學中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next date will be set at 4:30PM June ninth, 2014, for the examination procedure. Plaintiff, defendant should show up. If it’s neccesarily, both of you can have a lawyer. Do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	 Do you fully understand your right?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我瞭解

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are her for the preparation of adultery case. The plaintiff, yu wha chen sued the case. The main reason is that her husband John Anderston has intimate messages with his colleague in cram school. The plaintiff checks her husband’ cell phone and found that there are some intimate messages. Moreover, her husband often makes up reasons for working and has tele-conferencing with his colleague chia en Wang. The information collected by the plaintiff is beyond the co-workers’ relationship. So she sued the case. Defendant, your wife sued you of adultery case, what‘s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然無罪

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	Today’s purpose of preparation procedure is that we will focus on the detail of messages between the defendant and his colleague. The purpose is to find that whether the defendant and his colleague constitute adultery. Do both parties understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我瞭解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long did you marry your husband? Do you have any child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	I have been married him for 4 years, we don’t have any child.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you and your husband marry in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	My husband and I have known each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan for the purpose of teaching Portuguese. 

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	For the past few years, is his job of teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we just met, he is a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he still teaches Portuguese. But there are few people learning Portuguese, his teaching hours are unstable. Sometimes, there is one or two months which is a period between jobs. In order to reach a stable financial status, he wants to start to teach English. But his mother tongue is not English, he decided to seek advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree, did you mean that he wants to further study in Taiwan? 

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he needs to get some degrees of teaching English. He found a distance learning program from California on internet.  He can finish his course requirement by distance learning and he doesn’t need to go to America. After he finished the entire course, he can get the master degree. His plan is to get this degree of American course, and he can teach English in Taiwan. 

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleague in cram school. The cram school arranges them to be the partner. My husband partner with her in teaching.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I just noticed that my husband often extra-work in cram school. I have asked him several times that if it is an English cram school, did you really need to extra-work. He told me that because he needs to partner with the Chinese teacher in English teaching, he has to stay in cram school late for extra work. At t he beginning, I didn’t suspect him. But later I found out that after he came back home, he often pick some phone calls. After he picks up phone call, he didn’t talk on the phone in front of me, and go to the study room to talk with somebody. That makes me suspect him of some affairs, so I check his phone book.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find any problems in cell phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his record, I saw the same number on the phone book. I am curious about who she or he is, I check his messages. After I check his messages, I found out that he send the messages with the same woman almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	If they are only sending messages, is that any problems or is the detail unusual?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If they are the normal messages, that is fine. He is married, how can he make her send some intimated messages. I provide the court some messages on the phone. It should be in the fold. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please show the page 13. There are some messages, defendant please check the messages. Are these the detail in your cell phone messages?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的,這些是我的手機簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I am going to ask you some questions based on these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50 p.m on November 31th ,2012. It was sent by 0958-932-***. The text is that I really fix your love. What does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	那是從我同事傳的,我記得我請兩天假,他有點擔心我.這就是為什麼他傳這簡訊給我.我的同事是在美國受教似的,所以他非常開放.這是他說話跟表達的方式,至於愛是他表達對我的關心而以.

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that the sender is educated in America, so she is westernized, right? She expresses the feelings open-minded right? So the meaning of my love is nothing, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	當然沒有阿,這是兩個很好的朋友表達關心的方式

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	What about the last two sentences she just mentioned?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的他只是很擔心我,我們是工作上的同事.我請假兩天.他當然會擔心我.

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean that because you are two day off, your colleague worry about you, she send the message, right? Because she didn’t partner with you in English teaching, she miss you, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對那就是內容阿,根本沒有什麼

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent at 11:55p.m January 13th .2012. it is sent by the same cell phone. The detail is that I want you by my side, when can we be truly together? Can you tell me why do you have that kind of message?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他寫這句話是想要我知道中文的意思

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Did you mean that she sent the messages for helping you finish your homework?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太剛剛說的,我正在上一些課。我必須要完成30哥學分才算是結束。當然我就必須要完成一些功課阿。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain that what did you learn in Master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程是英語教學，在那樣的課程裡，有些是英文教學的課程，有些是文化以及語言表達的課程。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you are getting the master degree of TESOL. There are some cultural and communication courses, right

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對阿，我記得至少有三堂課跟文化與溝通課程有關係的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What’s your assignment of this kind of course you mentioned?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這堂課的功課是根據每個學生不同而定的，拿我來說，我在台灣是想尋求一個應予教學的學位，為了拿到這個學位，跟足夠的語言能力，我必須知道如何表達。所以我有很多功課是中文英文之間的翻譯功課。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have get some courses to prove that you have the Chinese language competence, right? So you have to finish the assignment in the courses which is sentences translation, right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	當然阿，我有時後還必須要潤飾我的作文還有口說能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Then we go back to the sentence we just mention. Is this sentence your homework?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，我還記得這句話。當我拿到這句中文的時候，我不知怎麼翻。你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說項天書一樣。我需要一些幫忙，所以請我同事幫忙。我告訴他我需要幫忙，所以請他幫我翻譯然後回傳答案給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean that your colleague translated the sentence into Chinese and send it back to you, is that what you mean? That is to say, the detail of message is just assignment, right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊只是我的功課罷了。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now we are going to show you that the details on page14 to 16. Please check the content. Is that just because you need to finish your homework, you ask your colleague for help, right?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，所有的簡訊都是為了完成我的功課。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	For your wife suspect you of having affair with yu chia Wang, what’s your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的是想太多了，我知道他對我沒辦法養一個家不是很滿意。我想告訴法庭的是，在我開始想學課程的時候，他沒有給我任何支持。他並沒有給我任何幫助完成學業。如果他可以給我多一點支持或幫助的話，我就不需要問我同事拉。我覺得他需要為所有的誤會負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you just said, is there any quarrel between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在結婚一開始的時候，我們當然過得很開心阿。問題在於….。我試著想要在台灣交葡萄牙文，但教課十束真的很不穩定。我的工作問題就變成我們的大問題。我們常常為了這件事在吵架。他根本不相信我其實進了我最大的努力。我沒辦法讓他知道我所面臨的挫折跟處境。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Ok, let’s back to the master degree courses you just mentioned. When did you start your courses? Did you finish the course and get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年春天開始。他是兩年的課程。我應該是在2012年12月就要完成我的課程。我沒有修完課程，因為我還要打工兼職。而且我沒有時間作作業。就像我太太說的，我太太一直都不是很支持我做這件事，我覺得我是一個人為了學業在奮鬥。我覺得我很累而且很綽折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean that the course is two year period, and you didn’t finish the course, can you tell me why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有完成課業的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When did the semester end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一個學期是在2012年的秋天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	Based on what you just said, your semester ended on December 12th ,2012. You should not any assignment after the semester, right? But you and your colleague still send the messages to each other for six months after the semester ended. Can you tell me why?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我或許是沒有完成學業，但不代表我不想增進我的語言能力。就算我沒有完成學業，沒有拿到碩士學位，我還是想增進我的能力，所以我才繼續傳簡訊。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that even though you didn’t finish your master degree, you still want to improve your language ability, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
en-US	對，這就是為什麼要找我同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	Did you mean that your colleague is like your tutor, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不只是一個家教，而且他是一個很好的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her money?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	我本來要付錢給他，可是他拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you don’t pay her money, why did she still send the messages at midnight for helping you answer the question? Is that beyond the co-workers relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，他是一個非常支持我的朋友。他總會用他自己的時間教我中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是的，我還在那工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does your colleague cia uin Wang also serving as a teacher in the cram school?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	他還在那工作，但我們不再是伙伴的關係了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any evidence need to investigate or subpoena any witness?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to sopena the colleague, working for the bo yun cram school, cia yun Wang as witness to the court. I want to ask her why she sends these messages and the purpose of doing so.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school takes some actions to solve the relationship between them. They try to encourage the colleague to quit the job. I want to know if the court asks the cram school to prove that.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? The situation is that your master degree has ended on December 5th .2012. There is no reason for you to explain the interaction of you and your colleague; especially you often send the messages after 9 o’clock. That’s really wear. Do you have any evidence to prove your innocence

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我沒有任何希望法庭替我調查的證據。就像我說的，我跟我同事傳簡訊的理由非常簡單。我只想增進我的語言能力而且繼續學中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today, we are here for the preparation procedure for the case of adultery. The defendant, YuHua Chen filed this case. She filed this case mainly because her husband, John Anderston, has the intimate relationship with his co-worker in the cram school. She found some intimate message in her husband’s cell phone. Moreover, her husband often makes up reasons for working so he can have the time with his co-worker, Cai Yan Wang. The defendant searched the message between her husband and the colleague is not the normal relationship about friends. As a result, the defendant filed this case. Plaintiff, your wife sued you with the crime of adultery, what do you have to say?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In preparation procedure today, we mainly want to know the details of message between the husband and his co-worker, This action is mainly for finding out if this case constituted the crime of adultery or not. Do both parties understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, defendant, how long has you married with your husband? Do you have any kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years and we do not have children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or in other countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We knew each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and he mainly what to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the past few years, did the husband teach Portuguese in Taiwan, is this his job?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first knew each other, he was the Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not quite popular in Taiwan so the teaching hours of my husband is not very much. And there might be the period between two jobs in one to two months. Then, because he wanted to have the more concrete salaries so he started teaching English. However, he is not a native speaker of English so he seeks for advance degree in Taiwan.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he decided to have the advanced degree, do you mean that he want to have a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He wants to teach English in Taiwan so the advanced education is for the English teaching. He found the distance learning program which was provided from the California in America. In this way, he can finish the online program without going to the foreign country. In this way, after he finishes all the credits, he can get the master degree. He planned to find the English teach position after he gets the master degree of English teaching. 

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So, what is the relationship between your husband and the person he had an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are the co-worker in the cram school. In that cram school, they arranged a Chinese teacher to partner with the foreign teacher. And that woman is my husband’s partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know there is an affair between them? 

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I just noticed that my husband often stay in the cram school for extra working. I asked my husband many times why you have to work extra time because it is just an English cram school. He told me that because he had to partner with the Chinese teacher, they have to communicate many details. At first, I really didn’t suspect him; however, I found that he often got some calls after he returned home. When he got the phone call, he didn’t get it in front of me and he even went to the study room to pick the phone call. Then, I was doubtful for it so I check his cell phone. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So, did you find some unusual message in the cell phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In the records, I found the same number so I was very curious and I go to check his message box. After my checking, I found that my husband send message to the same woman almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	I think the message is acceptable, is there any unappropriated words? 

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it is just the normal language then I can just ignore it. However, my husband is married, how could he let that woman send some intimate to him? I provide some intimate records to the court, I think they are in the investigate file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please check the investigate file one page thirteen. Plaintiff, please read it, here are some messages from your cell phone. Are these messages from your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	沒錯，這是我手機上的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now, I want to ask you some questions about the message. The first message was sent from number 0958-932-XXX, and this message was sent at nine-fifty p.m. November twelve, 2012. And the content is “I really miss you, my love,” What does this mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	恩這是我一個同事傳給我的，我記得我那時請了兩天的假，她有點擔心我的狀況，所以她才傳給我這個簡訊。我同事在美國讀過書所以她也比較開放。她就是這樣子講話來表達自己的情感的。至於那句”my love”，那只是我們叫彼此之間的方式罷了。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because your co-work has ever received education in America so she might be westernized? So…she might be open-mind to express her thoughts? So, as to “my love”, there isn’t any meaning behind it?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	不是啊，那就只是一個詞來稱呼好朋友罷了。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the prior sentence? 

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我剛剛說的啊，她很擔心我，我們又是工作上的搭檔。當我請了兩天的假，她當然會很想我啊。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So the co-work sent to such a message only because you had two day off for the work? Without your assistance of teaching, she miss you? That’s all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊，就這樣子而已，那簡訊沒什麼啦。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Ok, let’s see the next text message, also sent from the same cell phone, sent at nine fifty p.m. January thirteenth 2013. The content is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” How about this message? Why did she send such message to you?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳這簡訊給我是要教我怎麼樣寫我中文課的一個作業。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Do you mean that your co-worker send you such a text message is to help your homework? 

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太剛剛說的，我正在接受碩士的進修課程。在那個課程中，我必須要修完30個學分才能得到這個學位，那當然啊，我必須要完成指定的作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you explain that what kind of education are you receiving now?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的學位是英語教學，這個課程一部分是在上英語教學，而其他部分主要是在上有關文化和溝通方面的事物。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you are receiving for the English teaching master degree but there is some culture communication programs in that case?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，我記得至少有3個學分和文化溝通有關吧。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What kinds of assignments are given for the culture and communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	文化溝通課程的作業是因人而異的，舉我的例子來說，我在台灣然後我又想當一位英文老師，為了成為英文老師，我必須有足夠的中文能力，因此我的作業大多是和中英文翻譯有關。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, this program ask you to show the good Chinese competence? As a result, you have to finish the assignments given by the program, and the assignments are about translations.

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	沒錯，我也被要求要訓練好我的口說和寫作的能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s go back to the words you said, is this your assignment? 

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對啊沒錯，我記得那句話，當我拿到這份英文作業時，我不知道怎樣用英文表達，你也知道，對外國人來說，中文字是很難的，我需要幫助所以我請我的同事來幫我。我請她幫我翻譯之後再傳簡訊告訴我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Because you ask your co-worker to translate, she sent you the Chinese answer. Is this what you mean? That is to say, the message is only the answer to the assignment, do you mean this? 

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對啦，那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now, we check the investigate file one page fourteen to sixteen, please read it. Did your co-worker send you all these messages only to help you with your assignment? 

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，所有簡訊都只是要完成我的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	How do you explain about your wife’s suing that there is the unusual relationship between you and your co-worker, Cai Yan Wang?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的是想太多了，我知道她一直對我沒辦法養這個家一直很不滿意，我希望法院知道的是，我太太在我開始進修的期間從來沒有支持過我，她根本不想幫助我，然後讓我得到這個學位，如果她願意幫助我的話，我就不會去找我的同事來幫我了，我覺得她才應該因為這些誤解來被譴責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you just say, it seems that there are some unpleasant relationship between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們剛結婚時，我們的確過得很愉快，但問題在於我的工作，我想在台灣教葡萄牙語但是工作卻不穩定，於是，我的工作問題成為我們兩個之間不佳關係的導火線，我們因為我工作的問題已經吵架很多次了。她不相信我已經盡力了，她也不能理解我所遇到的沮喪或是困難。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	So, let’s go back to the master degree you just mentioned. When did your master degree start, did your master degree finish, did you get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年春天開始上這個課，這是兩年的課程，我應該在2012年12月得到學位，我沒有得到學位是因為我必須兼職而我沒有時間好好寫我得作業。就像我剛剛說的，我太太對我沒有很支持，我覺得我修這個課的時侯都只是靠自己的努力。我覺得很累也很難過。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	Since the course is a two-year course, why didn’t you finish this course?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法完成課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When did the last registration finish? 

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一次註冊的時間是2012年秋天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If what you just said are true, then after your last semester of registration, which was on December twelve, 2012, so, after this date, you should not have any assignments, right? But the messages between you and your co-worker were keep send even after six months.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	雖然我沒有修完碩士課程但這並不代表說我不想要繼續增強我的中文能力。雖然我沒有修完課程，但是我還是想要繼續自學增強我的中文能力。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	Even though you didn’t finish the course, you still want to improve your Chinese competence and make your Chinese more fluently? Do you mean this?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	沒錯，所以我才請我同事幫我的。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your co-worker played as your tutor for you?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不僅是我的家教也是我的好朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我曾提議要付薪水給她但她婉拒了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why did she send you such a message at the midnight, the time people should be sleeping, why did she pay so much effort to help you? Is this kind of helping over the relationship between co-workers?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	就像我說的啊，她是很願意幫助我的人，她花盡所有的時間來教導我中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach at that cram school now?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對我還在那工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	How about your co-worker? Did she still work there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那工作和我們沒有再一起教課了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutors, is there any evidence you want to investigate or witness you want to subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena the co-worker who works at the 伯元cram school, whom is Cai Yan Wang, I want her to come here as the witness. I want to her to come here and explain the relationship between her and the plaintiff, also, I want to hear her explanations about the background of those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Defendant, do you have any further evidence that you want the court to help you investigate? 

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has some action about the relationship between my husband and the co-worker. The cram school also tried to persuade the woman to quit the job. I want to know if the court can confirm this issue or not.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Plaintiff, do you have anything you want the court to help you investigate? Your course has already finished on November fifth 2012. Actually, you do not have the reasons to have the action between you and your co-worker because your course has already finished. And the interactions between both parties’ messages are sent after nine p.m. and it is quite suspectful. Do you have any evidence which may help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我現在沒有想到任何法院可以幫助我調查的證據，就像我剛剛說的，我和同事之間的互動都沒什麼，我只是想要增進我的語言能力並且持續不斷的學中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court date will be set at four thirty p.m. June ninth 2014, we will meet here for the preparation for witness. Both parties please come here on at date. If it is necessary, you can have your lawyer.  

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	The court is finished. 

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	Now, I’m telling your rights and obligations.

en-US	You have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民或其他符合法律規定之資格，得請求法律服務。

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	You also have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you with your case. 

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的我瞭解

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today, here we are for the preparatory procedure for case of adultery. The plaintiff , Wu-Wha Chen, accused this case. The reason is that her husband, John Anderston, goes too close to his academic school co-worker. The plaintiff found some intimate messages in the defendant’s mobile phone. Further, the defendant will have more work after the job and he also had tele-conferencing with Cai Yan Wang after the work. The content that the plaintiff collected is beyond the co-worker’s relationship in this case. As a result, the plaintiff has this case. The defendant, what’s your plea that your wife thinks you have an affair.

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然沒有這回事阿

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	The main purpose of today’s preparatory procedure is that we want to know the details that the defendant connects with the woman. The purpose is that we want to know if the defendant has the adultery with his co-worker. Do both parties know the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I know.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是，我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	How long do you marry with your husband? Do you have kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have got married for four years and we don’t have kids.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Do you get married with your husband in Taiwan or in foreign countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met up in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan in order to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	Did he teach Portuguese as work in the past few years?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	In the beginning, he was a Portuguese teacher when we first met. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan so his teach hour is not stable. Sometimes, he has two months as a period between jobs. Later, in order to have a stable work, he tries to teach English. But his mother tongue is not English, so he wants to seek an advantage degree for English.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You said that he wants to seek an advantage degree. Is that mean he wants to have a degree in Taiwan? 

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he wants to get the degree about teaching English. He finds a distance learning program from California, America on the Internet. He can use the way of on-line learning instead of going to America to finish his learning. So that after he gets every credit, he can finish his graduate degree. His plan is: because his graduate degree, he can find some jobs about teaching English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship between the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-worker in cram school. The cram school has Chinese teachers and English teachers. So the woman partners with my husband. She is a Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	In the beginning, I found my husband often stayed in the cram school late. I asked for several times that why he needed work more because it is just a cram school. He told me that because he needed to partner with Chinese teacher so he needed to communicate with Chinese teacher frequently. I didn’t doubt him in the beginning. But later I found he had some phone calls after he came home. He never answers the phone in front of my face. He just went to the study room to answer the phone call. What I said made me feel confused and I try to check his phone. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you see something unusual in his mobile phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	His calling record showed a number that frequently shown on the phone. I was very curious and I tried to search his messages. After I searched, I found that he contacted with a woman almost everyday.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Just the text messages is ok I think. Is there any unusual message, unusual word in the message?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If the message is normal, that’s ok. But he is a person who got married, how can he deliver intimate messages. Previously I provided some contents of the messages. I think they are n the files of the court.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	The investigatory file, page thirteen. There are several contents of the messages. Defendant, please check them. Are they the messages from your mobile phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是，他們是我手機裡的簡訊內容。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now, I want to ask you some questions according to the messages. The first message is come from the phone number, 0958932xxx, and the date is 9:50 pm, November 31st in 2012. The context is that: 我真的很喜歡你，我的愛人。 What that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	那我一個同事傳的，我記得那天我兩天休假，她有點擔心，這就是為什麼她傳給我這個簡訊。我的同事是在美國受教育的，她的心胸比較開闊。那是她說話已集展現自我的方式。說「我的愛人」那是我們關心在乎的人的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You meant the person who sent you this message stayed in foreign country before so that she was westernized. And her expression for her feeling is more open so the words “my love” don’t mean other meaning, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	對阿，那在很重視彼此的平常的朋友裡是很常見的字。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the previous sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我所說的，她只是擔心我，我們是工作上的同事。我那兩天請假的時候她真的很想我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You meant the woman delivered this message is because you didn’t work for two days? Is that right? Because she didn’t have your cooperation in the class so she missed you? Is that? 

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	沒錯那就是整個內容阿，這簡訊沒什麼大不了。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message, which is delivered from the same mobile phone numbers, is delivered at 11:45 pm, on January thirteen in 2013. the message is that: 我真的很想跟你在一起，我們什麼時候才能做到呢?我們何時才能在一起呢? What the sentence mean? Why do you have such a message in your mobile phone? 

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她告訴我這個句子是因為她想告訴我怎麼樣在中文裡表達這個意思。因為這個是在我的作業裡面。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You said that the woman delivered this message to you is because she wants to help you with your assignment. What is that meant?  

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就是有一個英語教學的時候，我老婆在打這場官司的時候。在那個課程裡我需要得到三十學分，這樣我才能完成我的學程。所以我要完成一些作業和課業上的功課。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Please explain your graduate degree. What are doing in the program?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的計畫是英語教學。在那個課程裡有些部分事關於英語教學的部分，有些是有文化以及語言能力的課程

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So, your program is for English teaching graduate program and in that program it also has some culture learning courses. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三堂課關於文化與溝通的課。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What the assignment in this culture communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這文化溝通課程可能因每位學生狀況不同而因人而異。以我做為例子:我在台灣試著找一個教英文的工作。為了正明我有這個能力擔任這個職務，我必須在中文上有一定的語言能力。因此很多給我的作業是有關中英的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You said because you want to teach English in Taiwan, in the program, you need to prove that you have a certain Chinese competence. You need to finish some assignment in the program and the assignment is about translating Chinese. Is that right? 

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	沒錯阿，而且我還被要求要針對我的口說和寫作能力來磨練磨練。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Ok. Let’s come back the sentence before what I said. Is that your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對阿，我記得那句話。當我拿到一些中文句子的時候我不知道怎麼用英文表達。你知道的，有些中文字對外國人來說是很難辨認的，我需要一些幫助所以我請我的同事來幫我 我請她幫我翻譯那個句子並且寄簡訊來告訴我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You meant you asked your colleague to translate the Chinese into English. So she delivered that message to you. Is that the situation happened? You meant this message is just the answer of the assignment.

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那簡訊就真的只是我功課的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	The message in our investigatory file between the pages number 14 to 16. Please check these messages. Are those messages delivered by your colleague because you ask for help to your assignment? Are they right?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯，這些全部的簡訊都是為了完成我的作業這個目的所發送的。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What’s your explanation about your wife accused you that you have an affair with Cai Yan Wang? What’s your plea?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太對這件事真的想太多了。我知道她對我顧這個家的能力沒有很滿足，我希望庭上瞭解我老婆從我讀這個學位的最開始就沒有支持我。她根本沒有意願來幫助我完成這個學位。如果她能有一點點幫助我的意願的話，我根本不用請我的同事幫我。我覺得她應該要為這些所有的誤解道歉，我希望她理解。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your sentences, you and your wife do not have a satisfied marriage.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們最一開始的婚姻時，我們確實有一段不錯的時光。但問題在於我的工作。 我嘗試在台灣教葡萄牙語維生但我沒辦法得到穩定的教學時數。所以我工作的問題變成我與我老婆之間的問題。我們時常針對這個問題吵架。她不信我已經盡了我的全力，我沒棒法讓她知道我所受的挫折以及我所處的困境

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Ok. Let’s talk about your graduate degree program. When do your program begin? Is that finish? Do you finish the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在民國99年的春天開始這個課程。這是一個兩年的計畫。我應該再民國101年12月完成這個計畫的。我沒有完成這個學位因為我需要做我的兼職工作所以我沒有時間完成一些作業。就像我所說的，我的老婆沒有很支持我在這個學位上。這讓我覺得追求那個學位完全都是靠我個人，我太累了也太受挫。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You meant this program is for two-year long. Why you cannot get the degree? Why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我不能完成所有課程所要求的東西。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When is your registration over?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊在學最後的期限是民國102年的秋天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you said, you finish your degree program on December 5th in 2012. After that day, you don’t need to finish your assignment. Is that right? But you have messages delivered by your colleague after the course ended for six months. What’s your reason?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我雖然沒有完成這個學位但並不代表我不想讓我的語言能力進步阿。就算我的計畫失敗了，我仍然想要增進我的中文能力所以我靠自學來達成這個目標。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You meant although you didn’t finish the program, you want to learn Chinese by yourself in order to improve your Chinese ability?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	沒錯，這就是為什麼我請我同事幫忙的原因。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleague plays a role as your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她並不是我的家教而已，而且他是我真正的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我嘗試要付她錢但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	You didn’t pay her salary, why she still delivers some messages to you in the midnight although you didn’t pay her. Isn’t that beyond the co-worker’s responsibility for helping others?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說他是一個很支持我的朋友了。她用她自己的時間來協助我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	沒錯我仍然在那邊上班。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does Cia Yen Wang still work in the cram school, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她仍然在那邊上班，但我們不是搭擋了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you need to subpoena more witness or evidence?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena Cia Yen Wang in Bo Yuan cram school to the court. I want to ask her to explain the relationship between she and the defendant and ask her to explain the meaning of those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, do you need any help from the court to investigate any further evidence?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has some actions according to the relationship between my husband and his colleague. One of the actions is to persuade Cia Yen Wang to quit the job. Can we ask the court to prove that action?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you need the court to investigate any evidence for you? The situation is your degree finished on the December 5th in 2012. You don’t have a reason to act with your colleague Cia Yen Wang in the reason of finishing your assignment. Especially, your message activity is starting after 9pm. Your behavior is suspected by people. Do you have any evidence to help your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我沒有想到有任何庭上可以採取的行動來針對我的行為。就像我所說的，我的同事和我的行為的目的是非常簡單的。我只是想要增進我的語言能力和學習中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So we will have the witness asking court at 4:30 pm, June 9th 2014. The plaintiff and defendant need to come to the court. If that is necessary, both of you can have lawyers.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Ok. Today’s court ends here.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國103年5月27日。」

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	 Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery. The defendant , Yu-Hua Chen, file this case. The reason why she files this case is that her husband had an intention relationship with her colleague in the cram school. The defendant finds some intimate message in her husband cellphone message record. In addition to that, her husband have some and have tele-conference at the middle of night. The content which was found by defendant is beyond co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, she file this case. Your wife charge you of adultery. What’s your plead?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然是無罪答辯

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	  The procedure of today is to ask the defendant about the detail information of message. The purpose of this court is ask more information and confirm that whether it will constitute adultery. Do both sides understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes,I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白了

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Let me ask the defendant, how long did you married and di you have child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	My husband and I have married for four years. We don’t have child

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or on abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met in Taiwan. Four years ago he came to Taiwan and wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	Was his job is to teach Portuguese in Taiwan for several years ago?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	 In the beginning, he was the Portuguese teacher in Taiwan. After we get married, he continued to do that. But Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hour is not stable. Sometimes he did not any job for one month to two months. Because he tried to get stable job, he tried to teach English. But his mother tongue is not English, he decided to

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mention he want to get advanced degree?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	 No, he hopes to teach English in Taiwan and he tried to get degree about English teaching. He found distance learning program in California. Therefore, he does not have to come to America and finish his degree from online learning. After he finish his degree, he can get the master degree. His plan is that he can get this degree and found English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship between the person he had affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleague in cram school. The cram school arranges foreigner teacher and Chinese teacher. Therefore, the Chinese teacher was the person she had affair with, right?

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know that they have the affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	Initially, I found my husband stayed in cram school and worked for long time. I have asked him for long time that it was just English cram school and why did you work overtime. He told me that he had a partner of Chinese teacher and he had much communication with her. At first, I had no doubt on him. I found that he would pick up some phone after his works. When he picked up the phone, he would not tell in front of me and choose to talk in his study room. This action makes some doubts on him and I started to check on his phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you found something wrong in his cell phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I found that he usually made the same phone call to someone. I started get the curious in his phone book. After that, I found he had the message with woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	 It was just message, is there something wrong in the message?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it was just normal message, that’s fine. He is the person who get married, how could he send some strange message? I have the content of their message to the court, it should be concluded in this file. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please see file one on the page thirteen. There are several content of message, please look at it. Does the message come from your cellphone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這是我手機上的內容簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now, I have several questions about this. Does the first message comes from the number 0958932 in the time of 2012, November 31th at 9:50p.m.? the content”我很想念你的愛” 這是怎麼一回事.

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是從我一個同事發過來的，我記得他因為我休假想念我所以才發過來的。她有點擔心我，這就是為什麼他發簡訊給我。我同事在美國接受，她覺得這樣是很正常的，這就是她這樣表達自己想法。而這封簡訊”我很想念你的愛，這只是我們表達關心的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You just mention that she stayed in the States so her thought is more westernized, right? Her emotional expression is more deliberate, tight? So ,“My love” does not mean so much, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	這樣的表達方式在親密朋友是很常見的。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the meaning she just mentioned before?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我前面說的，她只是擔心我，而且我們只是工作上的同事。我這樣請假兩天，她擔然會擔心我啊。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	 Do you mean that you just leave for two days and she send this message to you? Without your assistance in class, so she missed you very much? Just that?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	內容就是這樣，沒什麼大不了的阿

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent from the same number in 2013, January 13th at 11:55 p.m. 簡訊內容”希望在身邊何時能達成” Can you tell me the mean and why she send this message to you

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這封簡訊是想問我說如何表達這樣情感在他的作業裡面。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You just mentioned sthat she sent this message for you just to help you with your assignment and when did she send that?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太剛剛所說的，我現在在遠距教學課程之中。在這個課程之中，我必須得修滿30學分才能拿到學位。那當然我得完成一些指定的作業

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you just explain what did you study in your degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的學位主要是有關英語教學。在這學位的課程之中，有些是關於英語教學，也有一部分文化有關，但是有些和語言能力有相關。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	You mean that your degree is about TESOL but there are some courses about culture communication, is that correct?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	式的，我記得課程裡有三門課和文化溝通有關。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	In this kind of course, what kind of assignment did the professor give to you?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	在這門課程中，每個學生拿到的作業都因人而異，就以我來說，我是一個在台灣尋求英語教學的人，為了證明我有能力達成這樣的事情，我必須得證明我有很好的中文能力，所以在我的作業裡，有很多描述中英之間翻譯的不同

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean that your plan is to teach English in Taiwan and you have to have good Chinese ability. You have to complete some assignment in this course. The content of assignments is to translate Chinese sentences

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對，除了這樣之外，我必須得精進我的中文口說和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Ok, let’s come back to the sentence you just mentioned. Is those content about your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，我還記得這個句子，當我拿這樣的中文句子，我不知道要怎樣翻成英文，你也知道，有些中文字對外國人來說很難辨認。我需要幫助，所以我找我的同事幫忙，所以我請她翻譯，把答案傳給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean the situation is that you type Chinese to her and she sent English sentence to you, is that correct? In other words, the message is about the answer of your assignment.

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊就只不過是我作業上的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Please look at file one from thirteen to sixteen. Please see all content. Are all message the answer of your assignment? which get help from your colleague

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，所有簡訊就只是為了完成我作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Please explain that your wife just mentioned you have very close relationship with your colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang.

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太實在想太多了，我知道她對於我無法支撐家庭，養家活口很不滿意。我想讓法院知道，當我在修這門課的時候，她沒有給我太大的幫助。她並不想幫助我完成這個學位，如果她願意幫忙我，我就不要請教我的同事了，她才是為這些誤解負責

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your saying, there is some unsatisfactory between you and your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	剛結婚的時候，我們過得很愉快，但問題在於我有沒有工作，我想在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是工作一直很不穩定，所以工作就成了我們兩個之間的問題，為了工作這件事，我們已經吵了很多次了，她不相信我已經盡力了，她都不了解我遇到的挫折和很大困境

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	OK, let’s come back to the degree we just mentioned. Can you tell me that when did you start and did you finish and get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	這課程在2010年春季開始的，他是一個兩年期的課程，我應該在2012年12月會完成這個學位。但我沒有完成是因為我中途有許多工作，所以沒有把時數補滿，就像我之前講的，我太太沒有支持我這樣做。所以覺得只有我一個人在為這個學位而奮鬥，所以我感到疲倦而且挫折

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean that this degree is a two-year program and you did not finish it. Could you explain that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有完成所有必修課程

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	The last semester you register in this course, when did you end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後註冊的學期是2012秋季

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If everything was going through like you said, the last semester would end in 2012, December 5th and you wouldn’t have any assignment after that. But you still have message for six months after the course ended.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	 雖然我沒有完成我的學位，但不代表我不能增進我的語言能力阿，雖然我沒辦法完成學位，但我還是想增進我的中文能力，所以決定自己研讀

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean even though you failed to finish this degree, you still want to learn Chinese and improve yourself.

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	那也就是為什麼我持續問我同事問題

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So, your colleague play role with tutor in your learning.

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他扮演不僅是家教而且要是很要好的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her money?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我想付錢但她不要了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you did pay her money, why did she answer you at midnight which she was supposed to? This relationship is not normal between colleagues.

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	 就像之前說得，她是一個非常好的人。他願意花她的時間來幫我增進中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach in the cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對，我仍在那邊

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Did your co-worker, Tsai-Yen Wang work in this cram school?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她仍在那邊工作，但我們沒有再一起教書了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there more evidence you want the court to investigate or subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena his colleague , Tsai-Yen Wang, in Po-Yuan cram school which was the witness in this case. Please ask her why did she send those message and the content of messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	 Plaintiff, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had taken some actions to their relationship. I heard that the cram school had persuaded his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang, to leave the job. Is it possible that I want the cram school to confirm this.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you want ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you? The situation is that your case had finished in 2012. There is no reason that you can explain message for your assignment. Especially, your message comes from after 9 p.m. and those casue some doubts for people. Is there any evidence which may help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我覺得庭上好像沒辦法查到任何幫助我案情的證據。就像我剛才說的，我們之間傳簡訊的目的是非常單純的。這樣做只是為了完成語言能力和完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court will be set at 4:30, 2013, June 9th, for the procedure of witness. Both sides have to come to this court on time. If necessary, both sides could have lawyer, understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	了解了

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	That’s the court for today.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	Today we’re here for the criminal court, for the adultery case, case number 2887.And today is the preparation procedure.

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國103年5月27日。」

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民或其他符合法律規定之資格，得請求法律服務。
en-US	You have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low income family, a medium-and-low income family, or you are an aborigine or meet other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	You have the right to ask the court to investigate evidence which may help you with your case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解了。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	 Today is the preparation procedure for adultery case. The plaintiff, Chen Yu Hua, filed this case. The main reason the plaintiff file this case is that her husband has intimate relationships with his colleagues. The plaintiff found out some intimate message in her husband’s cellphone. In addition, her husband would find some reasons for working late and he would tele-conference with his colleague, Wang Chai Yu. The contents between her husband and his colleague collected by the plaintiff was too intimate, and it’s beyond the normal colleague relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. Defendant, your wife doubt you that you have adultery with other women. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然無罪。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	 Today is the preparation procedure. And the main goal is to clarify the contents between the defendant and his colleague. We would like to know this case in detail and to know if it constitutes adultery. Do both of the parties understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	 I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you two been married and do you have any children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We’ve been married for four years and we don’t have any kids.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Do you two get married in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met in Taiwan. He came to Taiwan four years ago. And at that time, he came to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	Has he taught Portuguese in the last (few) years?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not really popular in Taiwan, so my husband’s working situation is not really stable. Further, sometimes he would have a period between jobs (which) lasts for month. Then, he wants to have a stable income. He started to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he wants to pursue advanced study

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just said that that he wants to pursue advanced study, so does he want to get another degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he needs to get a degree for English teaching. He found a distance program online from California. Consequently he doesn’t have to go to the United States. He can complete the program at home. After he finish(es) all the courses, he can get the degree. If he receives the degree from California, the US, then he would find a job of English teaching in Taiwan

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s his relationship with his colleague

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues in the cram school. At that cram school, they assign a foreign teacher to match with another local teacher and that person is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know they two have intimate relationship?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I just noticed that my husband usually worked really late at cram school. I’ve asked him for many times. “It’s only a small cram school. Why would you need to work so late?” he told me that because we need to teach with another teacher at the same time, so we need to cooperate and need to discuss something. I didn’t doubt him at first. Later, he would receive some calls even when he arrived home. Further, he would answer the call not in front of me and he would go(es) back to his room to answer the call. This aroused my curiosity, so I checked his cellphone

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Do you see any abnormal message in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I saw the same number calls him or he calls that number in his cellphone. So I checked his text messages. After that, I found out that, he sent messages with a woman almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	I think frequently texting with another person is quite normal. Is the message content abnormal ?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	 If the content is normal, I would not doubt him. However, he’s already married, how could he make others send him some intimate messages? I provided the contents of the text messages. I think all of them is (are) in the documents.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please see the Document One, page13. Defendant, here are some pieces of your text massages. Please check it. Are they the same (as) the ones in your cellphone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，它們和我手機裡的一樣。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Then I would like to ask you some questions according to these messages. The first one is sent from the number 0958932*** at nine fifty p.m. on November 31st 2012. The content is I really miss you…(what do you mean by this sentence?)

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	我記得我那時候休假了兩天。她有點擔心我。所以她才會發這則簡訊。我的同事是在美國受教育的所以她待人比較隨和， 所以她講話比較直接就像簡訊上那樣。「親愛的」只是我們稱呼自己在乎的人的方法。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the person who sent you this message was educated in America, so she’s quite open-minded and westernized? Then she’s quite open to express her emotions and affections. Therefore, “my love” means nothing. Do you mean that?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	對阿，這就只是認識很久朋友互相的稱呼或是互相關心的人會這樣稱呼。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about another sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	我說過了，她很擔心我。但我們就只是同事的關係。當我有兩天沒去上班的時候，她當然會想到我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that she sent you this message just because you were two day off from work? Without your assistance and cooperation, so she missed you? Is that this simple?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對阿就只是這樣而已，並沒有甚麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Then, please check the second message. It’s from the same number at 11:55 p.m. on January 13th 2013. The content is something intimate, what does that mean? What does that mean by these lines?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這樣的訊息給我只是想要教我中文。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she sent you this kind of messages to help you with your Chinese assignment?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太先前說的，我正在唸一個學位。要完成學位我要在畢業前修完30個學分，那當然我需要做一些作業來拿到學分阿。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain further for your master degree? What do you study for?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的學位是有關英語教學的。要完成這個學位，裡面有些關於教學的課程也有些關於中英語文能力的訓練。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you pursue for the English teaching mater degree; however there are still some further culture courses in that degree?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，至少有三門課是跟文化和溝通相關的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	You used the tem culture, so what would the teacher give you as assignments in the course?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這門課的功課可能會因學生而異。像我自己的話，我來台灣然後想要找一個英語教學的教師職位，為了要達成這個目標然後顯現這個能力，所以我必須要有足夠的中文能力。因此我很多作業都是關於中英句子的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean that your goal is to teach English in Taiwan, so the course would ask you to proof your Chinese competence? Therefore, you had to complete some assignments and these assignments are about English and Chinese translation?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	當然阿，而且我還需要磨練我的口說和寫作技巧

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay, so you said that this message content was your assignment right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對阿，我還記得那個句子是甚麼。當我看到一個中文句子的時候我可能會不知道如何用英文來表達。你也知道吧，中文字有些時候對於外國人來說很難辨認阿，所以我需要別人的幫助，所以我就問我同事，我請她幫我翻譯然後請她把答案以簡訊寫給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean that you ask your colleague this sentence in Chinese and she sent it back in English? Is this the situation? You mean that this message was just all about assignment?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那則簡訊真的就只是作業答案而已啦。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Then, how about the contents in Document One from page 14 to 16? Please check these messages. Are they all for your assignments? Just because you want your colleague to answer you in English?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，它們的目的都相同，就只是要幫我完成作業而已。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then how about the adultery between you and 王彩燕 from you wife?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	對於這件事我太太真的是想太多了。我知道她對於我可以照顧家庭的能力不滿意。我想讓您知道的是，從我開始念學位開始，她都很不支持，她甚至一點都不想要幫助我完成學位。如果她多幫我一點忙的話，我也不用問我同事啦，我想她應該要為這樣的誤解負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, you two don’t get along quite well?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在婚姻初期我們是相處得滿愉快的。但她一直對我的工作有微詞。我也嘗試要教葡萄牙語來維生，但工作不穩定。所以我們有時候會為了這件事有口角，我們常為了這件事情不合，她都不相信我有努力找工作，我也很難讓她理解我有多沮喪和挫折。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to the mater degree you mentioned. When did you start your master degree? When did you end it? Did you receive the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2010的春季開始上課。它是一個兩年的課程，我應該要在2012的12月完成這個學業，但是我並沒如期完成，因為我有一些兼職，還要寫作業，這樣有點困難。就想我先前說的，我太太不太支持我，所以我會覺得我自己在念書的時候好像只有一個人在奮鬥，所以我相當疲憊跟挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean that it’s two-year-long program and you didn’t finish it, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法達成每堂課的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When was(did) the last semester you registered end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋季班。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If what you said I is true, and the last semester of your registration ended on December 5th 2012; then after that you would not have to contact your colleague for the assignment right? However, you two, you and your colleague, had been contacting with each other for over six months after that.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我可能真的無法完成學業，但並不代表我不想學習阿。雖然我無法完成學業，但我想持續精進中文，所以才會繼續和她聯絡。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even that you didn’t complete your degree, you still want to sharpen your Chinese by your own?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	是的，這就是我繼續和我同事尋求協助的原因。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	Your colleague is just like your tutor right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是家教的角色她還是我真心的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我曾經有提過，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why would she like to teach you Chinese so late at night, even it’s time for bed? Is it beyond the normal relationships between colleagues?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	我說過啦，她是一個很好的朋友，很支持我。她用她自己私人的時間來教我中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach at that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是的，我還在那裏工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does 王彩燕 also work there till now?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那裏工作，但我們沒有再搭檔合作了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Is there any person you want to subpoena or is there any evidence you want to investigate more?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena 王彩燕 as a witness from 伯元cram school. I want her to describe their relationships and why she wrote that kind of messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that cram school has taken some actions for their relationships. Further, the cram school had tried to make 王彩燕 off. I don’t know if there is any possibility to proof this.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? Now the situation is that your program should end on December 5th 2012, and you should not use completing assignments as an excuse to contact 王彩燕. The text messages between you two almost happened after 9 p.m. It’s really easily to rouse people’s curiosity. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我實在想不到有甚麼其他的證據了，誠如我之前所說的，我和我同事之間的簡訊互動真的很普通，我真的只是想要增進中文能力然後繼續學中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	Then we set next court at 4:30 p.m. on June 9th 2014 for the witness procedure. Please both of you show up at that time. If it’s necessary, you two have the right to lawyer.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Today’s court is adjourned.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we’re here for the preparation of adultery case.The plaintiff, Ms. Chen, sued the case.The main reason is that her husband is too intimate with his colleague at the cram school.The plaintiff found some messages from his colleague.besides, her husband always makes up reasons for staying late and even have conferencing with Wang zhia yen at night.The plaintiff thinks that the contents of her husband with his colleague Ms. Wang has over beyond colleagues relationship. As a result, she sued the case. Defendant, you wife sued you adultery. What’s your explanation?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我無罪

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparation procedure, we would like to clarify the details of the defendant and Ms.Wang. We are to find whether their relationship can constitute adultery. Do both parties understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	yes I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	how long have you been married? You have kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	we have been married for four years. We don’t have children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you two marry in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan and he wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	in the past few years, he worked at Taiwan as a Portuguese teacher?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language to learn, his teaching hours was unstable.sometimes he did not have to work for a month.Later he wanted to teach English, in order to have stable teaching hours.But his mother tongue is not English, so he decides to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned he seek an advanced degree, you mean he want to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get the degree of English- teaching.He found a online learning program from California in the USA on the internet.He can learn English on the internet without going to the USA.After he finishes the program, he can get a master degree.His original plan is that after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan as a professor.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship between he and the person he has affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues at the cram school.The cram school has an arrangement of a foreigner with a Chinese teacher. She’s his partner as a Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How come do you find out they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	First, I noticed that my husband always stayed late at the cram school and worked.I asked him several times, it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so many extra work?He told me that because he has to discuss many details with his partner.At first, I did not suspect him.But later I found that he always gets some calls after he came back.And, when he gets the calls, he talks in the study room. He never talks on the phone in front of me.So I checked his phone and I started to suspect him. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, there is always the same number.I was very curious and I checked his text message.After I checked, I found that she text the message with the woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	It’s just text messages, I think it’s okay, is there any weird content inside?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If these are just usual messages, that’s okay. But he’s a married man, how can he let the other people to send him those intimate messages? I’ve already provided some messages to the court, they should be on the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Document number 1 page number 13. Defendant, please check the content of the text messages.Are these from your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對 這些都是我手機裡的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I would like to ask you some questions about these messages.The first message is sent at 9:50 pm. November, thirty-one, 2012.from the number 0958932.The content is: I really miss you, my love, what’s the meaning of this?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我同事傳的，我記得那時我請了兩天假，她有點擔心,所以她寄了那封簡訊給我她是在美國讀書的，所以思想很開放那就是她表答自己的方法，她平常都這樣講話，至於my love那個地方只是要表答我們在乎的人

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean the sender was educated in the USA, so she’s more opened?She’s more open-minded about expressing herself, so there’s nothing with the two words, my love?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	那就是只是彼此是好朋友會這樣說而已，沒什麼啊

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	What about the last sentence she mentioned?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我剛剛說的，因為我請假所以她有點擔心，畢竟我們是搭檔, 她當然會擔心

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that she sent those two messages because you took two days off?Because without your assistance, she missed you, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對呀 就是這樣，沒什麼大不了

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Okay, then the second message which is sent at 11:55 at night, January thirteenth 2013, sent by the same person.The content is, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” Can you tell me what does it mean? Why she sends such a message? 

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這句話來告訴我要怎麼寫我一個中文的作業

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she sent you such a message is to help you with your homework? IWhat does it mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太剛剛告訴法官的，我之前想修碩士學位在課程中，我需要得到30個學分才能得到那個學位，當然我就會有一些作業

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain the details about your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我是在修英語課，在那些課程中有些是關於英語教學，有些則是關於文化與語言能力方面的

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you want to get the TESOL and there’s some cultural related program, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	我記得至少有三門課都跟語言文化有關係

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What’s the assignment in the program?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	語言文化的作業每個人不同我的話，因為我在台灣想要學習英文來當英文老師為了要達到這個目的，我必須要證明我對英文中文有足夠的了解所以很多的作業都是中英的翻譯句子

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to understand Chinese as to be the teacher in Taiwan?As a result, you have to finish your assignment including the translation of some Chinese and English? 

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的就是這樣, 而且我還需要增強我的寫作技巧以及口說

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay let’s go back to the sentence we just mentioned, is that your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	有 我還記得這個句子，當我拿到這個句子並不知道它的英文要怎麼講 你也知道有時候中文字對外國人來說真的很難，我需要別人幫忙所以我就請我的同事幫我我請她幫我翻譯那個句子然後再寄簡訊給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean that you asked your colleague to send you the answer with the text messages?Is that right?The content of the text message is just the answer of your assignment?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那些內容就只是我作業的答案而已

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Then let’s check the page number 14 to 16, the text messages content in the document, please check the content, are these text messages sent from the other party was because you have to deal with your homework?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What’s your explanation of your wife accused you of having adultery with you colleague?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太對這件事真的是想太多了，我知道她不滿意我在經濟能力可能無法養這個家我希望法官知道的是，在我剛開始要求學位的時候，她都沒有給我任何一點支持她根本不願意幫忙我完成我的學業, 如果她能稍微給我點支持，那我也不用找我的同事幫忙啊，我覺得會有這些誤會,都是因為他一開始不支持

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your explanation, it seems that there’s some trouble between you and your wife

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	結婚剛開始我們的確很開心，不過問題在我的工作，我想臺灣教葡萄牙語, 可是沒有辦法得到穩定的授課時數結果工作變成我們兩個吵架的原因，我們總是因為這件事情吵架，她不相信我已經在這方面盡力了，沒有辦法讓她了解我其實真的非常挫敗

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s get back to the master degree you just mentioned. When did you master degree begin, does it end? Did you get your degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的, 這是一個兩年的課程, 我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的但因為我兼職的關係所以我沒有辦法在時間內修完學分像我剛剛說的，我的老婆並沒有很支持我，我覺得好像只有我自己一個人努力在追求那個學位, 我覺得很累而且很受挫

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean that the program is for 2 years and you didn’t finish at the end, what’s the reason?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒修完全部的必修

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	Then when did your last semester you’ve registered end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是在2010的秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If that’s true, just as you’ve mentioned, then your last semester should be ended on fifth December in 2012There should be no more assignment, right? But the messages you text with your colleague last for 6 months after your program has ended, what’s the reason?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒有完成我的學業但不代表我不想要增進我的語言能力啊！即使我沒有成功地拿到那個學位，但我還是想要增進我的中文能力所以我還是繼續努力

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對, 這就是我還找我同事幫忙的原因

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So, your colleague served as your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的中文家教, 她也是一個真心好朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她不收

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why did she still send you the text messages on midnight, when she has to go to sleep? Is this beyond one’s colleague should do?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個非常支持朋友的人，她用了自己的時間來幫助我學習中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still work in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對 我還有在那邊工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is your colleague, zhia-yen, Wang, still works there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那邊工作, 但我們已經不是搭檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there any detail or any other information or people you want to subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena Ms.Wang who worked in the cram school. I would like her to explain her relation with the defendant and explain the content and the reason that she texted those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had do something to deal with their relationships. They asked Ms. Wang to leave that cram school, I would like to know if it’s possible to clarify this fact?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?The situation is that your master degree, the program has ended on fifth December, 2012. There’s no excuse to say that you and Ms. Wang text message to deal with your assignment.Especially, you always send messages to each other after 9 o’clock at night, and that is very suspicious. Is there evidence can help you with your case？

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法想到任何其他的證據法院可以幫我調查就像我剛才說的，我們兩個通簡訊的原因就是這麼簡單而已，我只是想要進步我的語言能力然後繼續學中文而已

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The court will set at 4:30 p.m., ninth June, 2014, to cross question the witness, the defendant and the plaintiff should be there as well, if it’s needed, both parties can have your lawyer with you.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的我知道了

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we’re going to proceed the preparatory procedure of adultery case. The plaintiff, yu-hua, Chen, sued the case. The main reason is that… his…her husband is so intimate with his colleague at the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages from his colleague. In addition, her husband always makes up reasons for staying late and even have conferencing with Wang zhia…yen… at night. The plaintiff thinks that the contents of her husband with his colleague Wang zhia yen has over…beyond co-worker relationship. As a result, she sued the case. Defendant, you wife sued you…adultery, what’s your plead?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然沒有罪啊!

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, we mainly want to clarify the details of the defendant and zhia yen Wang. We aim at……to find whether their relationship can constitute adultery. Do both parties understand… know the process?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you married with your husband? Do you have any child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have married for 4 years and we don’t have a child.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	And did you two marry in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan, and he wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	During the past years, was his job teaching Portuguese…in Taiwan?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he’s a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still teach Portuguese. However, since there were no many people … not many people want to learn Portuguese, his teaching hours was unstable. Even for one or two months, there’s a period between jobs. After……. After that, he changed to teach English, in order to have a better job. But his mother tongue is not English, so he decides to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned he seek an advanced degree, did he want to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get the degree of English- teaching. He found a distance learning program from California in the USA on the internet. He can have the online learning without going to the USA … and learn English. After he gets all the credits, he can get a master degree. His original plan is that after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan as a professor.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship between he and the person he has affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues at the cram school. The cram school has arranged.. arranged a foreigner and a Chinese teacher together, and she’s the one who he partnered with.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How come do you think they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	First, I noticed that my husband always stayed late at the cram school and worked. I asked him several times, it’s only a/ it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so many extra work? He told me that because he has to partner with the Chinese teacher… they have to discuss many details. At first, I did not suspect him. But later on I found that he always gets some calls after he came back. And, when he gets the calls... picks up the phone, he always talks in the study room. He never talks on the phone in front of me. As a result, …I suspect,

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, there is always a… the same number, I’m very curious and then I checked his text message. After I checked, I found that she text the message with the woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	It’s just text messages, I think it’s okay, is there any unproper content inside?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If these are just usual messages, that’s okay. But he has… he’s a married man, how can he let the other party to text him with so many… text messages. I’ve already presented some text messages to the court, I think it is in the file… it should be on the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Document number… page number 13. Defendant, please check the content of the text messages. Are these from your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是 這些都是我手機裡的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	So I will ask you some questions about these messages. The first message is … was sent from…at 9:50 pm. November, 31th, 2012, from phone number 0958932…. The content is, I really miss you, my love, what’s the meaning of this?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我同事傳的, 我記得那天我請了兩天假, 她有點擔心, 所以她才寄了那封簡訊給我, 我同事是在美國讀書的, 所以她的思想很開放, 那就是她表答自己的方法, 她都是這樣說話, 至於my love那個地方只是要表答我們在乎的人

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean by … do you mean that…the sender was educated in the USA, so she’s more westernized? And she’s more open-minded about her feeling? So there’s nothing, or any meaningful/ meaning of the two words, my love?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	那就是只是彼此是好朋友會這樣說而已, 並沒有什麼

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	What about… how about the last sentence she mentioned?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我剛剛說的, 因為我請假, 她有點擔心, 我們就只是同事啊, 畢竟我們是搭檔, 她當然會擔心

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that she sent those two messages because you took 2 days-off? Because there’s no your assistance, she missed you, is that so?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對呀 就只是這樣的內容, 就沒有什麼大不了的

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Okay, then the second message which is sent at 11:55 at night, January 13th, 2013, and was sent from the same person. The content is, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” Can you tell me what does it mean? Why she sends such a message?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這句話來告訴我要怎麼寫我一個中文的專案

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she sent you such a message, is that she wants to help you with your homework? Is that right? What does it mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太剛剛告訴法官的, 我之前在…想得到碩士學位, 在那個課程中, 我需要得到30個學分才能得到那個學位, 當然我就會有一些作業要寫

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain… the details…about your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我是在修英語教學, 在那些課程中有些是關於英語教學, 有些則是關於文化與語言能力方面的

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you want to get the TESOL … you study for the TESOL program, and there’s some cultural related program, is that so?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	我記得至少有三門課都跟語言文化有關係

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	Then what’s the assignment/ what are the assignments provided from these program?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	語言文化的作業… 因人而異, 像我的呢, 就是, 我在台灣想要學習英文並且當英文老師, 為了要達到這個目的, 我必須要證明我對英文中文有很大…足夠的了解. 所以我很多的作業都是中英的翻譯句子

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to understand Chinese as to be the teacher in Taiwan? As a result, you have to finish your assignment and the homework includes the translation of  some Chinese and English?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的就是這樣, 而且我還需要增強我的寫作技巧以及口說技巧

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s… go back to the sentence we just mentioned, is that your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對啊 我還記得這個句子, 當我拿到這個句子並不知道它的英文要怎麼講, 你也知道有時候中文字對外國人來說真的很難, 我需要別人幫忙, 所以我就請我的同事幫我, 我請她幫我翻譯那個句子然後再寄簡訊給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean that you asked your colleague to send you the answer with the text messages? Is that the case? The content of the text message is just the answer of your assignment

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那些內容就只是我作業的答案而已

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Then let’s check the page number 14 to 16, the text messages content in the document, please check the content, are these text messages sent from the other party was because you have to deal with your homework?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對, 所有的這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What’s your explanation of your wife accused you of having adultery with you colleague?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太對這件事真的是想太多了, 我知道她不滿意我在經濟方面支持這個家庭的情況, 我希望法官知道的是, 在我剛開始要求學位的時候, 她都沒有給我任何一點支持, 她根本不願意幫忙我完成我的學業, 如果她能稍稍支持我一點, 那我也不用找我的同事幫忙啊, 我覺得會有這些誤會, 她才應該是要被責貴的人吧!

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your explanation, it seems that there’s some trouble between you and your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在一開始, 結婚前我們的確有一段很美好的時光, 但…問題在我的工作, 我想臺灣教葡萄牙語, 卻沒有辦法得到比較多的授課時數, 結果工作變成我們兩個吵架的原因, 我們總是因為這件事情吵架, 她不相信我已經在這方面盡力了, 我沒有辦法讓她了解我其實真的非常沮喪, 而且遇到很多困難

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s get back to the master degree you’ve just mentioned. When did you master degree begin, does it end? Did you get your degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的, 這是一個兩年的課程, 我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的, 但因為我兼職的關係, 所以我沒有辦法在時間內修習所有我要的學分, 像我剛剛說的, 我的老婆並沒有很支持我, 我覺得好像只有我自己一個人孤獨的在追求那個學位, 我覺得很累而且很受挫

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean that the program is for 2 years and you didn’t finish at the end, what’s the reason?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法修完全部的必修

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	Then when did your last semester you’ve registered end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是在2010的秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If that’s the case, just as you’ve mentioned, then your last… the last semester should be ended on 5th December in 2012, there should be no more assignment, right? But the messages you text with your colleague last for 6 months after your program has ended, what’s the reason?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我的確沒有完成我的學業, 但這也不代表我不想要增進我的語言能力啊! 即使我沒有成功地拿到那個學位, 但我還是想要增進我的中文能力, 所以我還是繼續研讀

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability and be fluently speaking Chinese, is that so?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對, 這就是我還找我同事幫忙的原因

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So, your colleague can be said as… served as your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的中文家教, 她也是一個真的好朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有, 我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why did she still send you the text messages on midnight, when she has to go to sleep? Is this beyond one’s colleague should do?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個非常支持朋友的人, 她用了自己的時間來幫助我學習中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still work in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對, 我還有在那邊工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is your colleague, zhia-yen, Wang, still works there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那邊工作, 但我們已經不是搭檔了!

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there any detail or any other information or people you want to subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena the…to subpoena zhia-yen, Wang who worked in po-yun cram school… as a witness. I would like her to explain her relation with the defendant and explain the content and the reason that she texted those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had do something to deal with … their relationships. One of that thing is that they … asked zhia-yen, Wang to leave that cram school, I would like to know if it’s possible to clarify this fact?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you? The situation is that your master degree, the program has ended on 5th December, 2012. There’s no excuse to say that you and zhia-yen, Wang text message to deal with your assignment. Especially, you always, you texted messages to each other after 9 o’clock at night, and that is very suspicious. Is there evidence can help you with your case？

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法想到任何其他的證據法院可以幫我調查的, 就像是我說的, 我們兩個通簡訊的原因就是這麼簡單而已.我只是想要進步我的語言能力然後繼續學中文而已

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So, the court will set at 4:30 p.m., 9th June, 2014, to cross question the witness, the defendant and the plaintiff should be there as well, if it’s necessary, both parties can have your lawyer with you.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的我知道了

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	So the court is adjourned.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case.The plaintiff, Yu Hua Chen filed this case.The reason why she filed the case is because her husband … had too imitate relationship with his colleague.The plaintiff found some very intimate massage in her husband’s cell phone.Plaintiff husband usually make up reasons for going home late … and have teleconference with his colleague彩燕王The … information that plaintiff had collected proved that her husband and his colleague has beyond co-workers’ relationship. As a result, the plaintiff filed the case.Defendant, your wife stated that you have committed adultery. In this case, what’s your plea? 

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯，當然

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the court is mainly to … know the details in those intimate massages.The purpose of today’s court is to find out whether the defendant does have committed adultery with defendant’s colleagueDo both parties understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long…have you married your husband? And do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years. And we don’t have children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or in the foreign country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the past years, his job is teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	At first we met, he worked as a teacher who was teaching Portuguese.After he got married, he is still teaching PortugueseHowever, the Portuguese is … always not a popular language in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hours are always not very long.Sometimes … the period between jobs might be one month or two months.Later on, he hopes to have stable income. Therefore, he started to want to teach English.But English is not his mother tongue; he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Did you mean that he wanted to study a diploma in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	NoBecause he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he needed to have a degree relating to English teaching.He found a program provided from the California online.  He didn’t have to go to America to learn the course. Instead, he can learn the course through on-line learning.If he finished all the courses required, he can have the degree.His plan is once he has the degree, he can apply for the jobs to teach English through this degree.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What is the relationship between him and his colleague?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in the cram school.The cram school will have a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher in the same class. And the woman is the Chinese teacher in his class.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know he had an affair with her?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I’m only aware of that he often stayed late in the cram school.I have asked him for many times that why you have to stay late in the cram school.He told me that because he has to work with the Chinese teacher, they have many things to discuss.At first, I didn’t doubt him.However, I found that he would receive some phone calls after he came home.And when he got the phone call, he will talk to the phone in his study instead of in front of me.This behavior made me doubt him. That is the reason why I started to check his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	In the cell phone, did you find anything special?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, there is a phone number called him often.I became curious so I checked his texts.After I checked, I found that he almost texted with another woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Texting messages is fine, right? Is the content inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If that is a normal text, that is OK.However, he is married, how could he text with another woman in such an intimate tone?I have provided some messages to the court. I believe you can see them in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please see the page 13 of investigatory file.Here are some messages. Defendant, please take a look.Are they the messages on your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是，這些是我手機上的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	According these messages, I want to ask you some questions.The first message was texted at nine fifty pm on thirty first, November, 2012 from 0958-932*** The content is 我真的很想你，我的愛 What does it mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我一個同事發的我記得那時候我休了兩天的假 她有點擔心我這也就是為什麼他會傳這封簡訊給我我的同事是在美國受教育，所以她的思想比較開放這是她說話的方式至於她稱呼我為我的愛，那只是一種我們之間的稱呼而已

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that because the person who text you is educated in the United States, she is westernized.And the way she expressed herself is more openSo “my love” doesn’t mean anything special, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	當然，這只是一種表達關心的方式而已，只代表我們很關心彼此

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the previous statement?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就如同我之前說的，她非常擔心我，我們是工作上的同事 當我不在工作崗位上兩天，她當然會想我啊

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean the person texts you because you have two days off.Because she didn’t have your help in the class, she missed you?That’s all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對，當時的背景就是這樣，這封簡訊沒什麼

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message sent at eleven fifty fife p.m. on thirteenth, January, 2013 from the same phone number mentioned above.The content of the message is 我希望你可以在我身邊，什麼時候我們才可以在一起呢?What does this message mean? What did she send you this kind if message?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	 她寫給我這封簡訊的原因是教我在作業裡怎麼用中文講這句話

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she texted you this message to help you with your assignment?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我之前講的，我正在進修碩士學程在這個學程，我被要求要修滿三十學分，才可以取得這個學位很自然地，我就有一些作業和練習要做啊

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain what exactly you studied for your Master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的學位名稱是英語教學在這個學程裡面，主要的課程有關於英語教學，其他則關於文化還有語言能力方面的課程

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you are seeking a degree about English teaching, but there are some courses about culture and language competence.

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是，我記得至少有三個課程和文化與溝通有關

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	In this kind of courses, what kind of assignments would you have?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	語言與文化課程的作業可能會因同學而異就舉我為例子我是一個希望在台灣能取得教師資格的人為了要達成這個目的，我必須要證明我在使用中文上很有能力因此，大部分我的作業是有關中英的翻譯

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Because you planned to teach English in Taiwan, the course required you to prove that you have the competence in dominating Chinese.So you have to complete the assignments given by the course and they are about translating sentences

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，而且我還被要求加強我的口說以及寫作能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So back to the message. You said that it is your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我還記得這個句子當我拿這個中文句子的時候，我不知道怎麼把它翻成英文你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說總是比較難了解我需要一些幫助，所以我向我的同事請求幫助我請她幫我翻這個句子，然後將答案用簡訊傳給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean you asked how to translate the sentence to your colleague and she sent the answer to you through texts, right?That is to say, the text is only an answer for an assignment.

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，那封簡訊只是我一份作業的答案而已

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	 Now, please look at the page 14 to 16 of the investigatory file.Please look at them. They are the content of the messages. Are these messages all sent for doing the homework?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，這些簡訊的功用都是為了幫助我完成作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then the wife suspected that you have an affair with your colleague 彩燕王. What is your opinion?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太對這件事情真的是想太多了我知道她對我的養家能力非常不滿我希望庭上可以知道，在我在進修的時候，她從來沒有提供任何幫助給我她很不願意幫助我完成我的進修學業如果她有願意幫忙的話，我就沒有必要我問同事了我認為她要為這些誤解負責

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your responses, it seems that there are some problems between you and your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	 我們剛結婚的時候，我們的確過得很開心但我的就業卻是個問題我嘗試在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是卻沒有辦法有很穩定的工作時數所以我的工作就變成我們兩個之間很大的問題我們常常為這件事情吵架她並不相信我已經盡力了 她完全沒辦法理解我遇到的困難和挫折

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to the Master degree course you just mentioned.When did you begin the course of the Master degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年春季的時候開始上課的她是一個兩年的課程我應該要在2012年12月的時候完成這課程但是我並沒有完成這個學業，因為我有兼職工作，造成我沒有時間完成我的作業如同我之前所說的，我老婆並不很支持我我覺我是一個人孤軍奮戰地追求這個學業我感到很累而且很挫折

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You said the degree is a two-year program and you failed to finish it.

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我當時沒有辦法完成要求的課程

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	Then, when did the last semester you registered end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一個學期結束在2012年的秋季

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you said, since your course ended on fifth, December, 2012, after that, you shouldn’t have any assignment, should you? However, the messages you texted with your co-worker continued six months after you finished the course.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我雖然沒有完成那個學業，但這並不代表我不想增進我自己的語言能力啊雖然我沒有完成這個學業，我還是想要增進我的語言能力，所以我就開始自修

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	Even that you didn't finished the degree, you still wanted to improve your Chinese, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，就是為什麼我會尋求我同事的幫忙

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the character of your co-worker is more like a tutor, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她並不只是一個家教，她是我真正的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her money?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我曾經想付她錢，但她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn't pay her, why did she text you back in such a midnight? Does it already beyond co-woker's relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	這也就是為什麼我說她是一個很支持我的朋友嘛她願意犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學習中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是，我仍然在那裡任職

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does the co-worker, 彩燕王, still work there, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她還那裡任職，但是我們並沒有一起搭檔教學了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there any further witness to subpoena or investigation?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want subpoena the co-worker, 彩燕王, form the伯元cram school as a witness. I want her to explain the relationship between the defendant and her. I also want her to explain the context of these messages and the purpose.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintill, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school did take some actions about their relationship.They even did try to persuade 彩燕王 to resign. I don't know if there is a posibility to confirm this thing.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendent, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?Now the situation is that your course already ended on fifth, December, 2012.There is no reson that you texted each other for helping you with your assignments.Especially, the messages you texted each other are after nine p.m. It is very doubtfull.Do you have any evidence that may help for your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不出任何可以幫助我的證據就如同我之前說的，我和我同事之間的溝通很簡單 我只是想要增進我的語言能力並加強中文

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So we set the next cout date at four thirty p.m. on ninth, June, 2014 to ask questions to the witness.Plaintiff and defendant, please show your attendence at that day.If necessary, you can have your own lawyers. Do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Today's court ends here.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的我了解

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we’re here for the adultery case, preparatory procedure. the plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case.it is mainly because she thinks that her husband, John Anderson, has an intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school.the plaintiff also found some intimate messages in the defendant’s cell phone.in addition, the defendant also made up reasons for extra working hours, and held tele-conferencing very often.What the plaintiff has found is beyond co-workers’ relationship.Therefore, she filed the case.the defendant, your wife filed you with adultery case. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the main focus is to find out details about your communication. another focus would be seeing if the behavior that you both had done constitute adultery or not.

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you been married?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We’ve been married for four years, and we don’t have any child.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you marry in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	i met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in the past few years, he works as a Portuguese teacher in Taiwan. Is that right?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	He was a Portuguese teacher when we met. After our marriage, he kept on being a Portuguese teacher. But since Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so he stopped teaching. Sometimes he didn’t work for one or two months. Later on, because he wanted to have a stable income, he started to teach English. Because his mother tongue is not English, he seeked an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned he’s seeking an advanced degree, so he decided to study in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. he hopes to teach English in Taiwan. What he really wants to obtain is an TESOL degree. He found a distance learning program in California online. So that he wouldn’t have to go to the states in order to get the degree. He only has to get it through distance online learning. After the program, he will obtain the master degree. His plan is through this program of TESOL, he could find a job as an English teacher.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what’s the relationship between him and the person he has affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They’re colleague in the same cram school. The school arranged a system. They require a Chinese teacher to work with a foreign teacher, and she is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know their affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At the very beginning, I noticed that he usually worked extra hours. I’ve asked him about this several times. It is a cram school. Why did he work that late? He told me that because he has a Chinese partner, he needs to negotiate some issues with her. At the very beginning, I trust him. Later on, I found that he often got some phone calls. He wouldn’t take them until he is away from me. Then I started to doubt everything, so I checked his phone book. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Is there anything weird you found?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his calling history, I usually saw the same number. Then I was curious about his messages. After that, I found he texted a girl almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Even if they texted each other every day, is that really wrong? Or you found something wrong in their message content?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If they were normal messages, I’ll just get through it. But he’s a married person, how can he receive intimate messages from a girl? Previously I have provided the court with some messages. They should be in the file. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please see page 13 on document 1. There are some messages. Defendant, please check. Are they the messages in your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的它們是

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	I would like to ask some questions about the messages. The first one was sent on 9:50 PM, November, 31 in 2012, and it is from the number 0958-932. It wrote 我真的很想你 I really miss you. What’s your explanation?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	是我同事傳來的。我記得那時候我請了兩天假，他有點擔心。也就是為甚麼他傳這封簡訊給我，他在美國接受教育，所以她比較開放。這就是他講話的方式，至於我所說的「愛」，這就是我們關心別人的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the message sender was educated in the states, so her ideas were quite westernized. Then she was quite open-minded about expressing her love. So the word “our love” doesn’t mean too much. Is that right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	當然啊，這在好朋友之間很平常，我們都是這麼說的。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the last sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的，他有點擔心我，我們是工作上的搭檔耶。當我離開工作兩天，他當然會想我啊

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So do you mean that because you had two days off and away from work. So she’s worried. Without your assistance at work, so she misses you. That’s all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊，那就是當時的情境，整個簡訊並沒有甚麼大不了

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Then the second message that we’re showing is sent at 11:55 PM on 13, January on 2013. It’s also from the same number. The content is “I want to..我想要你在我身邊，我們甚麼時候可以真正在一起？” can you tell me why she wrote like this?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他寫這封簡訊給我因為他想要問我這個句子的…

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So she wrote the message to you because you asked her to help you with a project?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太先前所說的，我正在進修碩士。在那個學程之中，我要修三十學分才能取的學位。很自然地，我就要寫作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you make it clear that what is your master degree about?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	是英語教學。在這個課程中，大部分的課程都跟英語教學有關，然後其中一部分是跟語言及文化的能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you’re seeking a master degree on English teaching, and there’s some courses about cultures and languages. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，至少有三門課跟文化還有語言相關。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	And this kind of cultural courses, what’s the assignment like?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	文化及溝通課程的作業每個人都不一樣。以我自己為例，我目前人在台灣，然後正在攻讀英語教學的碩士學位。為了要達成這個目標而且證明我的能力，我必須要證明我有中文的能力。所以很多我的作業是翻成中文的句子。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan. So the exercise in the courses ask you to show… that’s the reason why you need to finish some homework. And the homework is mainly about Chinese and English translation.

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對，我要磨練自己的口說還有寫作技巧。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So let’s go back to the message. This is your homework, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這個句子的時候，我不知道怎麼用英文表達。因為有些中文字對外國來講，很難去辨認。我需要幫助，所以我就請我同事幫我。我請他幫我翻譯這個句子，然後用訊息傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean that because you had an assignment, and you turned to her for help, so she sent the message for you. Is that right? In other words, the message is the answer of the homework, right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，那只是作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Then we’re going to see on page 14 to page 16. All the messages. Please verify the content. Are they all the answers of your homework?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，他們都是我的作業，全部都只有一個目的，就是為了完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	For the point of your wife saying you have an affair with your colleague 彩燕王. What’s your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	她想太多了，我知道他對我支持家庭並不滿意。我想讓庭上了解的是，在我碩士課程的剛開始，他就沒有提供任何協助。她不想要幫我完成學位。如果他願意幫一點點忙的話，我就不用請我同事幫忙。關於這一切的誤解，他要負最大的責任。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, the relationship between both of you doesn’t seem good.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	剛結婚的時候，我們的確有段開心的日子。但我的就業造成了一些問題。我想要在台灣交葡萄牙文，但是授課時數並不穩定。所以我的工作便造就了一切問題。我們常為這件事吵架。他不相信我已經盡了全力，我也不知道怎麼讓他了解我的挫折還有困難。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	So let’s go back to the master degree program. When did the program start?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始的。是兩年的課程。我在2012的十二月應該要結束。因為我那時候有兼職的工作，沒有足夠的時間完成作業，所以沒有準時畢業。如我先前所說的，我太太不願意幫忙。我覺得我是獨自一人追求那個學位。我很累也很挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean it is a two-year degree, and you didn’t finish it in time. Why is that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成課堂作業。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	So when was the last semester you registered?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	是在2012年的秋天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If what you have said is true, the last day of your semester should be on December 15th, 2012. So after the program, you won’t have any assignment. Is that right? But the intimate messages continued even six months later after your program. 

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	就算我沒有作業了，我也想要精進我的中文。雖然我沒有辦法取得那個學位了，我還是想要持續進修，成為獨立學習中文的人。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even if you don’t have the courses, you still want to improve your Chinese, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，這就是為甚麼我請我同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So she is like a tutor for you? 

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不只是像一個家教，他也像一個真正的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	我想要付錢，可是他拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why does she want to send the messages at midnight when most people are asleep. Isn’t it beyond what a co-worker would do?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我說他非常支持我啊。他用他自己的時間幫我學中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Did you still work in the same cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So your colleague 彩燕王also work there now?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	他還是在那邊上班，可是我們不是夥伴了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there anything that you want the court to investigate? Or any person to subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena his colleague 彩燕王 who is working at 伯元 cram school as a witness. I would like to ask her to explain the messages and her relationship between the defendant.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there anything that you want the court to investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has taken some action for the affair of them. And I also heard that they persuaded the woman 彩燕王 to resign. Is there the possibility to ask the cram school to explain about that?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate? The thing is the program ended on December 15, 2012. You can’t just explain your relationship with 彩燕王 through the purpose of finishing the homework. Especially your messages were usually sent during 9 to 12 PM. That is really doubtful. Do you have any evident that may help you in the case.

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到法庭能替我調查的事情。如我所說的，我和我同事的通訊，理由都很簡單。我只想要精進我的中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court date would be on 4:30 PM, June, 9th, 2014 for the inquiry procedure. Please make sure that you will be here. If necessary, you can have a lawyer with you.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解了。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for preparatory procedure of adultery. The plaintiff files this case. The main reason that she files this case is because her husband has intimate relationship with his colleague. The plaintiff found some message in her husband’s cell phone. And her husband will use some excuse to chat with his colleague on the internet by tele-conferencing way. The message found by plaintiff showed that the relationship between her husband and his colleague is beyond colleague relationship. So, she files this case. Defendant, for what your wife said, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	For today’s preparatory procedure, we will understand the details of intimate message between defendant and his colleague. The main purpose is to make clear that the defendant and his colleague is adultery. Do both parties know the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我明白了。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long you got married with your husband? Do both of you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We got married for four years, and we don’t have children. 

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or other country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We got known each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan, and the main purpose is teaching Portugese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	For these years, did your husband just teach Portugese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we just meet each other, he was teaching Portugese. After we got married, he was still teaching Portugese. However, the Portugese class is not very common in Taiwan, so his teaching hours is not very stable. Sometimes, a period between the class will be 1~2 month. For fixed income, he started want to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he wanted to get an advanced degree. 

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	The advanced degree that you just mentioned means that he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he tried to get a degree of teaching English. He found a learning program on the internet from California. This program makes him can have on-line learning, and he didn’t need to go to Unite States for these classes. After the classes, he can get the degree. For this plan, he tried to get the degree and find a related job.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship that he has an affair with? 

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues in the cram school. The cram school set the Chinese teacher and foreign teacher program. And that woman is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	In the beginning, I just know that my husband would stay in the school for more hours. I asked him so many times: why he should stay in the school for more hours. It’s just a cram school. He told me that he has a partner, and he has to communicate with his partner for long time. In the beginning, I didn’t think too much. After that, I found he would get some calls in home. And he would avoid get the phone call around me, and he would get the phone call in study room. It made me very suspicious, and I started to check his cell phone. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find any evidence in his cell phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I used to see the same number in his cell phone. I am so suspicious, so I started to check his message. After that, I found that he almost sent the message to same woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	What’s inappropriate thing in the message?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If that’s a common message, it’s alright. But he got married, how can he have intimate message with others? I just provided some message to the court, and it supposed to be in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please see the investigatory file one of page13. There are some messages. Defendant, please see these pages. Is from your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這是我手機裡面的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now, I have some questions about these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50PM on November 31, 2012. And it’s from the cell phone number 0958-932… And the content is “我非常想你，我的愛” what that means?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	恩，那是由我同事傳給我的簡訊。我記得那時候我有兩天的休假，他非常擔心我，這就是為什麼他傳這個簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國接受教育，她非常開放。那就是她說話的方式。關於簡訊裡面的字眼，那只是我們稱呼對方的一種方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that because she stayed in the foreign country, her thinking way is westernized. And the way she showed the feeling is open-minded. So, there is no further explanation for “my love,” is that right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	並沒有甚麼其他的意思，那只是好朋友之間的一種稱呼，就僅只於這樣而已。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the sentence before that?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就如同我之前所說，她很擔心我，而且我們只是同事當我連續休了兩天假後，她只是很擔心我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that because you had two days off, she was worried about you and sent that message for you? Because she didn’t have your assistance, she missed you. That’s all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	沒錯，就是這樣。簡訊的內容並不是甚麼大問題。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was from the same person. It was sent at 11:55 PM, in January 13 2013. 訊息內容是〝我好希望你在我身邊，我們甚麼時候才能有正當的關係呢?〞What that sentence means?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她發這樣的簡訊給我只是想要讓我知道，這樣的句子如何用另外一個語言來表達。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you mean that the purpose of message just want to help you to do the assignment, what’s that mean? 

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我之前所說的，我有一個遠距教學的課程。在那個課程中我需要修習三十個學分才能完成那個課程。當然在課程中，我必須要完成一些作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you just explain about your degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我修習的課程是英語教學。課程主要的內容是英語教學、文化以及語言能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So, the degree that you got is TESOL, and there are some culture classes in that degree, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	沒錯，我記得大概有三個課程是有關於文化和溝通的部分。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What’s the assignment about these classes? 

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	在課程中，指派的作業對於每個人來說都不太一樣。舉我的例子來說，我是一個在台灣想要教英文的人。為了這個目的我必須在課程中展現我有能力表達好中文。因此，我的作業中有很多是關於中文翻譯的部分。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to have the competence of … For that purpose, you had to complete the assignment about translation, is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	沒錯，我必須增進我的說和寫能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So, we just go back to that sentence. You mean that the sentence is just for your assignment, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	沒錯我記得那個句子。當我看到那個中文句子後，我並不知道那句子的中文意思是甚麼意思，你知道的阿!有些中文句子對於外國人來說是非常困難的，我需要一些幫助，所以我請我同事幫忙，我請我的同事幫忙翻譯並以簡訊方式寄給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that you just asked her to translate. And she just translated it and sent it to you, is that right? This message is just the answer for the assignment, is that right? 

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊只是作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now, we are going to show you the investigatory file one page14~16. Please see the content of these pages. So, the main purpose of these messages just for the assignment, so she sent that messages for you, is that right, is that right?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯，所有的簡訊內容都只是為了要完成我的作業而已。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What’s your explanation of adultery between your colleague and you filed by your wife?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我的太太對於這件事情非常感冒，我知道她對於這件事情危害家庭有很大的不悅。我想要告訴庭上的是，她其實對於我的這個並沒有甚麼太大的幫助，他並不希望我得到學位，要是如果她有一點意願幫助我，我也不用去請我的同事幫忙，我覺得她應該因為這件事情遭到譴責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you said, both of you didn’t get along with each other …

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們剛結婚不久時，我們過得很開心。但問題就出在我的工作，我只是想要在台灣教葡萄牙文。但我的授課時數真的很少，所以我的工作成為我們相處之間的問題，我們為了這件事情一直爭吵，他不相信我已經盡了最大努力，我不知道要怎麼跟她說我的挫折。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	We just go back to the degree that you mentioned. When did you start you your program? Did you get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在102的春季課程開始的，那是一個為期兩年的課程。我必須在103年的12月完成課程。我並沒有完成我的課程，因為我有一個兼職工作，所以我時間不夠去做那些作業。就如同我之前所說，我的老婆並不支持我，我覺得我一直在靠我自己的能力去追求那些課程，我開始感到很疲倦而且挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So, you mean that the program is for two years. And you didn’t finish that program, what’s the reason?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我不能完成課程中的所有作業。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	What is the last registration semester of your program?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一個註冊學期是在103年。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If all you said is true, it supposed that you would not have any assignment after December 5 2012. The message sent between your colleague and you last six months after the semester, what’s the reason?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	恩，我沒有完成那個課程並不代表我想要停止精進我的語言能力。即使我沒有完成那個課程，我還是想要精進我的中文能力

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So, you meant that even if you failed to get that degree, you want to make your Chinese more fluent by yourself, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	沒錯，那就是我為什麼要請我同事幫忙的原因。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	You mean that your colleague is just a role of tutor, is that right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她並不只是一個家教而已，她也是我的好朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay for her? 

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我曾經試圖給她錢，但是她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay to her, why would she send that message for you even if in the mid-night. Is that beyond co-worker relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	就像我之前所說，她只是一個熱心助人的朋友。她運用很多時間來幫助我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	沒錯，我還在那裡教書。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is that colleague still in that cram school?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	沒錯，她仍然在那裏工作，但我們已經不再搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Does the prosecutor want to have more any evidence or witness?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena the witness of defendant’s colleague, Tsai Yan Wang. We want her to explain the background and purpose of that message.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Does the defendant want the court to find some evidences for you? 

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I just heard that the cram school took some steps for them. And they tried to persuade his colleague to leave the cram school. Can we check this? 

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you want the court to find some evidences for you? The situation is that you finished the program on December 5 2012. You should not have the excuses of doing homework for sending the message. Particularly, both of you sent the message for each other after 9:00 PM, it’s very doubted. Do you have any evidence for your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我無法想到有甚麼證據可以幫助我的案子，就如同我之前所說，我和我同事之間的簡訊只是平凡的簡訊而已。我只是想精進我的中文能力而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So, the next court day will be set at 4:30, in June 9 2014, and it will be the witness inquiry procedure. Please both of you should make it. If it’s necessary, both of you can have lawyers, is that clear?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白了。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	We just dismiss here. 

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	Today we are here for the preparation of adultery case, case number 2887.

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國103年5月27日。」
en-US	Today I am here for adultery case, case number 2887. As an interpreter, I promise to faithfully and honestly translate what is stated in this court. In the case of deliberately making false interpretation, the violation of perjury will apply.

zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparation procedure of adultery. The plaintiff, Yu Hua Chen, filed this case. The plaintiff suspect her husband, John Anderston, has a beyond co-worker’s relation with his co-worker of the cram school, and the plaintiff found some intimate messages in the defendant’s cell phone. In addition, the defendant will always make up reasons for going out in the with Wang Cai Yan and also has the tele-conference with her in the midnight. According to the information found by the plaintiff, she found that their relationship is beyond co-worker’s relationship. Therefore, she filed for this case. Defendant, your wife suspected you are having an affair with another, and she filed for the case of adultery.

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然是無罪的啊!

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the main purpose of this procedure is to seek out the detail information to find out whether the defendant is having an affaire with Cai Yan Wang and it might constitute the adultery, do you understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	 I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, I want to ask the plaintiff, how long have you married, and do you kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have already married for four years, and we do not have kid.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Do you marry your husband in Taiwan or in other country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan as a Portuguese teacher.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	During those years, did he teach Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we met, he was a Portuguese teacher, and after we married, he still taught Portuguese. But Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan; therefore his teaching hours are not stable. Sometimes he might did not have any class between one or two months. Because he wanted to make our financial status more stable, therefore he started to taught English. But his mother tongue is not English; therefore, he sought an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mention before that he sought an advanced degree, do you mean he studies a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Because he hoped to teach English in Taiwan, therefore, he have to get the degree of the TESOL. On the Internet, he found a distance learning program provided by California school. He did not have to go to the US, and can learn on-line. After he finishes the classes, he can get the degree. His plan is to find an English teacher job in Taiwan by getting an US degree.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Can you explain the relationship between your husband and the woman in this case?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in cram school. In the cram school, they have the system of a foreigner teacher partner with a Chinese teacher, and they are partners.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they are having an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I found that my husband started to stay at the cram school for a long time. I asked him many times “It is just a cram school, why did you have to stay there so long?” He told me that because he had to partner with a Chinese teacher, and they had to cooperate with each other. At first, I did not suspect he is having an affair with her. But after a while, I noticed that, my husband would get some phone calls after he came home. When he received those phone calls, he did not speak the phone directly in front of me, instead going to the study room. That is the reason why I checked the information in his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything strange in his cell phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	 I saw his phone calls always from one number, so I was curious about the text messages and I checked them. After I checked the messages, I found that he almost chatted with a woman everyday.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	I think it is okay to text messages, is anything wrong in the content?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If those messages’ content are normal, that will be okay. But he is a married man, how could he let a girl to text him some intimate messages? I have provided some content of the messages, I think they might in the investigation file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please check page 13, file one. There are some messages content, please check them. Are these your messages from your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對，這些是我電話中的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I have some question about the message content. The first message is from the cell phone 0958-932xxx at 9:50 p.m., on December thirty first, 2012. The content is 我非常想你 可以請你解釋一下嗎?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我同事發來的。我記得那陣子，我休了兩天的假。她可能有點擔心吧。這就是她發給我這封簡訊的原因。我同事在美國受過教育，他非常開放，這是她的講話方式啊!至於她稱呼我是她的愛人，這只是她的一個稱呼罷了。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that because the people was educated in the USA, and she is westernized, and she is open minded to express her feeling, so the name, my love, does not mean a lot?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	這只是普通朋友間很常見的稱呼，或者是表達你對你很親密朋友的關心罷了

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the previous line?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	我說啦，她很擔心我，我們是夥伴啊!當我請了兩天的假以後，她當然會開始想我阿。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You are saying that because of your two days off, she texted you this kind of message. Without your help in the work, she missed you a lot. Is that all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	這封簡訊就沒甚麼大不了的，內容是很普遍的， 這只是很單純的簡訊。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The next message was from the same cell phone at 11:55 p.m., on January thirteenth, in 2013.內容是我想要你在我身逼，甚麼時候才能在一起呢? Can you explain the content?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她發簡訊給我，只是為了告訴我功課的中文該如何表達的一句話

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Do you mean that she sent this message to you just to help you with your homework can you explain that?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	我太太之前有跟庭上報告過，我正在上遠距離教學。為了得到學位，我必須完成30學分，當然啦，我就必需完成一些功課或者是作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain that what is your master degree for?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是有關英語教學的。這個學位的課程內容有些是有關英語語言能力的、有些是有關文化跟英語教學。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you are saying that in your master degree, the main program is for English competence, but there are some culture classes?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，我記得課程裡有3門課程是有關文化溝通的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	Can you tell me the homework of the culture communication classes?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這門課裡，每個學生的作業都是因人而異的。以我自己為例的話，我在台灣想要當一名英文老師，為了達到這個目的，我需要證明我有足夠的語言能力，尤其是對中文的掌握。所以我的功課內容很多是有關中英語間的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Your plan is to teach in Taiwan. Therefore, you have to prove you have the Chinese competence. So you have to finish some assignments, and that is about translation between Chinese and English, is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	我還必須加強我的寫作和口語能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s go back to the next point. You said that is your homework, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	我記得這句話。當我拿到這句話的中文時，我不知道要怎麼把它翻成英文。你知道的，中文對外國人來說是很難辨識的，它們都長得一樣。我需要一些幫助，所以我就請我的同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯這句話，再把這句話寄給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You are saying that you gave your college the Chinese sentence, and she translated it into English and sent it back to you. Is that right? In other words, the content of this message is just a part of your assignment, is that right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	這封簡訊的內容，就只是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now, please check page 14 to 15 of file one, the content of all messages. Please check those messages. Are they all your assignments, and you ask your co-workers to help you?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	這些簡訊都只有一個目的，就是為了幫助我完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So, as for the accuse from you wife that you are having affair with Cai Yan Wang, what is your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了。我知道她覺得我對家庭的付出不夠。我想要強調，再我求學的這段過程，我太太一開始完成沒有支持我。她不希望幫助我完成我的學業，如果她願意幫助我的話，我根本就不需要請我的同事幫我。我覺得她應該為造成這種誤解負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you said, I think there might be some misunderstanding between you and your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們剛結婚時真的很甜蜜。但我的工作造成我們之間的問題，我試著在台灣教葡萄牙，但我的授課時數一直很不穩定，所以我的工作問題就造成我們兩個之間的不和，我們為了我的工作常常吵架。她不相信我已經近全力在工作了，我也不知道我要怎麼表達我己經…我的沮喪、我的難過

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s back to your master degree. When did you start your master degree? Did you finish? ….When was it?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始課程的。這是一個兩年的課程。我本來應該在2012年的12月拿到學位。可是我並沒有拿到學位，因為我必須在台灣做兼職工作，而我沒有很多時間來做我的作業。像我之前說的，我太太並不支持我。我覺得我在追求學位的時候是一個很孤單的過程，我覺得太疲累、太沮喪。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	Did you mean the program is a two-year program but you did not finish the course? Why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When was your last semester registration? 

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If you are telling the truth, the last day of your registration was December fifth, 2012. So after the day, basically you do no have any homework, is that right? Can you explain why you kept contacting with your co-worker after the last day of your registration for six months?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	恩..我沒有拿到學位，但不代表我不想增進我的中文能力。雖然我沒有拿到學位，我也想要練習我的中文，所以我一直自學。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even though you fail to finish the degree, but you still want to improve your Chinese and make you speak Chinese fluently?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，所以我才請我的同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So, the role of your co-worker is as your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，還是我一個貼心的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我有試著付她錢但是她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	So, if you did not pay her, why did she need to text you in the midnight when everyone is sleeping? Does that far beyond co-worker’s relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我才說他是一個很支持我的朋友。她用她自己私人的時間來幫助我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對，我還在那家補習班工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	And, does the co-worker, Cai Yan Wang, still work there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那家補習班工作，但我們現在已經不是夥伴的關係了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there any evidence you need to investigate or any witness to subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena Cai Yan Wang, who is still working at the Bo Yuan cram school, as a witness. We want her to explain the reason why she texted those messages, and explain the relationship between she and the defendant.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there any evidence you want the court to investing for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	 I heard that the cram school has do some action because of their relationship. And there even someone was trying to persuade Cai Yan Wang to leave the cram school. Is it possible to verify the truth?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there any evidence you want to court to investigate for you? The situation is your program was ended on December fifteenth, 2012. There is still no reason for you to keep texting messages with Cai Yan Wang for helping the homework. Especially, most of your messages are after nine o’clock, it is very suspicious. Do you have any evidence to prove your innocence?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我現在想不到有任何證據可以提供給法院來證明我的行為。我說過了，我和我同事間的簡訊互動是非常平常。我只是想要繼續學中文，並且增進我的中文能力。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So the next court will be at four o’clock p.m., on July ninth, 2014. The main purpose of the court is to examine the witness’s statements. Plaintiff and defendant please show up on that day. If necessary both of you can have your lawyers. Do you understand? 

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Okay, so the procedure ends here.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are going to discuss the adultery case. The plaintiff filed this case. The reason is that the plaintiff’s husband had the intimate messages with colleague in the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate massages in her husband’s phone. Moreover, her husband often made up reasons for additional working in the cram school, and sometimes in the in the night………The plaintiff found the content in the messages and the behavior between them is beyond co-worker’s relationship. Defendant, your wife doubts that you have adultery, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我無罪答辯阿當然

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparing procedure, the main course is to ask the defendant and his colleague about the intimate messages. The aim is to find out if they constitute the adultery. Do both party understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long is your marriage?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	Our marriage last four years, we don’t have child.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you marry in Taiwan? Or abroad? 

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I acquainted with my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So I the past years, your husband’s job is teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we know each other at the very first time, he is a teacher who teaching Portuguese. After we married, he still teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hour is not very regular. Sometimes, there….will….are 1or2 months between jobs. to make the income more regularly, he changes to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he seeks an advanced degree. 

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	As you said, he want to seek a advanced degree. Is it mean he want to get the degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he want to teach in Taiwan, he wants to get the English teaching degree. And he found a distance learning program on the internet which is from the California. This program enable him to not to go to the America and still can get the learning program from distance learning. And after he…complete this program, he can get the degree. His plan is after he get the degree from the program, he can teach English in Taiwan. 

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what’s the relationship between the person he has the affair with

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleague in cram school. The cram school schedule a program which combine the Chinese teacher and foreigner teacher. And the woman is the Chinese teacher who partner with him. 

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did know they are in the adultery?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I found my husband usually stay in cram school for additional work. I had ask him many time:”it just a cram school, how could he stay there so long?” he told me that, he has to teach English …………………. At beginning, I didn’t doubt him. However, I found that after he went home, sometimes he will got the phonecall in night. When he got the phone call, he won’t talk in front of me; however, he went into the study room. It made me become doubtable ……….. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So what did you find in his telephone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, it appears a same number many times. So I am very curious about that, so I check his phone book. After I check her telephone. He sent the messages every day. 

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Even if he sent the messages every day. It’s normal, or if there any……………

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If these are common messages, it’s ok with me. However, he is married, how could that woman sent the intimate messages. I had provide their messages I the court. I think they are in the file. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	I am going to show you a file……….there are some contents of the message. Please check. Are these your messages?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是這是我手機的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	And now I will ask you some questions about the messages. The first one is in 9:30 pm, on 2012, Nonmember 31, from 0958932***. The content is “I really, my love.” What does it mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	喔那是從我同是那傳來的阿,我記得那天我休假了兩天,而他很擔心我發生什麼事了,這也就是為什麼他要傳簡訊給我,我同事是接受美國教育的,他是個很開放的人,這就是他講話的方式,他表達自己情感的方式,致於我們通常都稱對方…..

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	As you said, the one who sent the message was educated in America, so she is very open mined or westernized. So the way she express herself is more open minded. So the term “My Love” do not mean anything, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	當然阿,對我們來講,這就是對於好朋友之間的稱呼阿……………..

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	What about the message before that?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的阿,他就是很擔心我阿,我們是課程上的搭檔,當我休假兩天的時候他是真的很想我阿

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the woman sent these messages just because you didn’t go to work in these two days? Because without your help, she was very miss you. Is that all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對阿,這就是整個簡訊的重點,所以簡訊內容根本就不是什麼了的是

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	So the second message is from in 11:55 pm, on 2013, January 13. And this is from the same sender. The content …………….  What does this message mean? Why did she sent this to you?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他傳這封簡訊是教我怎麼用中文表達自己的情感

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Do you mean that the sender sent this message just because she wants to help you with your assignment?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太告訴你們的,我參加了一個碩士課程,在那個課程中,我必須完成三十個學分才能的到學位,所以當然我必須完成許多作業跟研究報告

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain what’s your degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我所受的課程是英語教學課程,那課程包括一些英語教學還有文化,語言能力相關的一些課

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So the degree you are going to get is about TESOL and about the culture communication, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對阿,救我記憶所及,我記得有三個課程都跟文化溝通有關

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what’s the assignment from culture communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這個課程作業會根據每個學生的不同有不一樣的作業,以我為例,我是一個想在台灣獲得英語教學碩士的人,在這個課程中我必須證明我自己的語言能力,而且我必須向這個課程證明我的中文能力,所以在這個課程中我所做的作業都跟中英翻譯有官

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the English degree you want to get ask you to prove your Chinese competence? So you have to complete the assignment about the culture communication, right? 

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對阿當然,同時我也必須精進我的說跟寫

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So let’s go back, so do you mean that these are your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對阿當我看到這些中文句子的時候我還不知道我要怎麼把它翻成英文,我想你們應該知道這些句子對外國人來講是很難去記得的,我需要別人的幫助,所以我請我的搭檔協助我,我請他幫我翻譯這些句子,然後請他寄給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	As you said, you ask the colleague to help with your assignment, so she translated the sentences to English and sent these to you, right? So in other saying, the messages are the answers from the assignments?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	這些簡訊都只是我作業的答案而已

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now we are going to show you the file one, the page 14-16, there are all the content of your messages. Please, check the content. Is that all the answer of your assignments which you ask your colleague to help you?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的這些簡訊內容全部都是為了協助我完成我的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So according to your wife’s ……………what’s your explanation? 

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得我太太想太多了,我知道他對於我養這個家有很多的疑問,我希望庭上可以了解,在我尋求我的碩士學位時,他從來都不曾幫助過我也不曾支持過我,他根本就不願意幫助我去完成我的學業,如果他有那麼易點院易幫助我的心的話,我今天就不用我同事幫我了,我覺得這一切都是因他而起

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, is there any unhappy thing between you both?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	一開始我們結婚的時候,我們的確有一段快樂的時光,但是問題是……我試著在台灣教葡萄牙語,但是我的授課時數真的一點都不夠,所以我的工作漸漸變成我們兩個之間最大的問題,我們為了這件事情爭吵不休,他不相信我,我為了這件是已經盡的最大的努力了,他真的不了解我有多麼挫折,而且我有多麼想要完成這件事情]

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	So let’s go back to the master degree program. When did your master program start? Is it finished? Or you are in program now?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年春天開始的,他是一個兩年的課程,我必須在12月12號之前完成他,但是我並沒有完成這個課程,是因為我同時我還有兼職工作,我並沒有時間去完成這個課程需要的作業跟報告,就像我說的我老婆從來就沒有支持過我,我認為我在追求我的碩士學位期間我很孤單,我覺得很累也很挫折

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So you mean that the program is a two years program? Why didn’t you complete this program?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	因為我無法完成每個課要求的

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	So what is the finished day of your last registration?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我這個註冊學期是2012年的秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	According to your statement, the finished day of your program is 2012.Dec 5. So after that day, you should not have any statement after that day, right? But the messages between Wang and you is last 6 months after you finished your master degree program. Why?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒有完成我的碩士學位並不代表我不想要精進我的中文能力阿,就算我沒有完成我的碩士學位,我還是想要精進我的中文能力,所以我還是請我的同事協助我

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that even you failed the master program, you still want to polish cjinese competence, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對阿,所以這就是我為什麼要請我同事幫我的原因

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So do you mean that your colleague is like you tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不只是我的家教也是我的好朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Do you pay?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有阿,但是我曾經說要付錢給他但他說不用

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	So if you didn’t pay her, why did she send you messages? Is she a diligent girl? Is that go beyond co-worker’s relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	就像我說的,他是我非常好的朋友,他用他所有的時間來幫助我,幫助我學習中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	So do you still teach English in that cram school? 

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對我還在教書

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is Wang still teaching there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	他也還在那教書阿,只是我們不是搭檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any further investigation? Or do you have to subpoena anyone?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena Wang in the 伯元cram school in the next court as the witness. I want her to explain the function of the messages and the relationship between the defendant. 

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, do you have any evidence that your want the court to investigate for this case?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard about that the cram school had take some actions to handle the relationship between them, And they had pursued the woman, Wang, to drop the job. Would the court check this?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate? The situation is that your master degree was finished in 2012, Dec 5. It is not the reason to explain the behavior between you and Wang. Particularly, your communication was ….at 9 pm. It was very strange. Do you have any evidence which can help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我不認為法庭可以為我找到什麼證據幫助我,就像我說的我跟我同事之間的溝通是非常正常的,我只是想要精進我的中文能力而且持續的學習

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court is set to……….4:30 pm, on Jane 9, 2014 as the………… plaintiff and defendant, both of you have to come. If you need…..according to your needs, you can hire the lawyer. 

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白了

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	The court is adjourned here.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your right?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the investigatory procedure for the adultery. The… the plaintiff, Yu-Huwa Chen, has press…press the case. The reason why he filed this case is because she think his…her husband have too… have a very… um… have a very intimate relationship with his crime…crime-school (cram school, 發音不對) co-worker. And plaintiff have found some very intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. And plus, the defendant… her husband is always, er, usually will find some reason for staying in the workplace, or find some excuse go out… go out with this…co-worker? Or use…or use teleconference. And all these information that the plaintiff has collected is…has proved that the relationship between her husband and his co-worker is beyond the average coworker relationship. So, she filed the case. Defendant, your wife think you have a affair with someone else, so she’s want to press a charge for you…press a charge of the adultery. What do you think?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然是無罪開釋。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s court, we are… we will mainly focus on… asking the…asking the communication details between the husband and this co-worker. The purpose of this… of today’s court is to try to find out whether or not that the… that the defendant had a real… had a real adultery with…with this, his co-worker. Both of you understand… what we are going to happen today?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you been married with your husband? And did you have any child… did you have any kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We’ve been married for four years, and we have no children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	 Did you get married… did you got married in Taiwan? Or in the foreign country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, when he first arrived Taiwan, he wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So then in the past few years, is what he did for living? …….teach, teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he keep doing that, he kept doing that……teaching Portuguese. But the Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hour is not very stable. Sometimes the period between jobs will be one or two months. So…after that, he want to have a regular income, so he started to teach… so he started to teach English……he wanted to start teach English. But the English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he wants to… he wants… he wants an advanced degree? Is that he… is that means… is that mean he tried to study a degree in Taiwan

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he needed is something related to English teaching. He find a distance learning program on the net. So he don’t… he didn’t have to go to American, America to learn the thing. He can get this degree through distance online learning. So after all the program subject he had learn, he can get his degree. His plan was that through this American degree that he can found a job in Taiwan to teach English.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So, what is the relationship between your husband and this co-worker he’s having affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-worker in the cram school. The cram school had the teaching style that the Chinese teacher will partner with a foreign teacher, and that co-worker was… is Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	So how did you know about this affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	 At first, I just noticed that my husband always stay in the cram school to do over-work, I think. I had asked him so many times: it’s just a cram school, how did you have so many works to do? He told me that because this partner teaching, he has to discuss with his partner a lot. At first, I had no doubt. But after a while, I found that he would always get some phones after he got home. And when he got these phones, he won’t talk… he would not talk in front of me, he would go to our study room to take these calls. That’s why I started to doubt the situation. That’s why I checked his phone book.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	 In the phone book, is there anything unusual? 

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	His record, there’s a number keep showing… kept showing up. So I got curious, so I checked his messages. After that, that’s when I found that he almost have these text messages with this girl, co-worker, everyday.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	It’s just the message, is that serious? Is there improper in these messages? 

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it’s just a normal message, then nothing will matter. But he’s a married man! How could he let the other sent these so intimate message… intimate sentence to him? I had provided some messages in my evidence to the court. I think it’s all in there.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please see the record p.13. Here are several messages from your cellphone, please look at it, defendant. Is this from your smartphone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對，這是從我手機裡拿出來的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I’m going to focus on these messages and have several questions for you. The first message is… was dated back to 2011, Nov. 31st, in the… 9:15 in the evening, and it’s from 0958932xxx. (後面翻成中文了囧)

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是一個我的同事傳給我的。我記得那個時候我請了兩天假。她有點擔心。這就是為什麼他要傳這封簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，她的思想非常開放。那就是她講話和表達感情的方式。那至於”我的愛”，我們就是這麼稱呼所在意的人。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean this message sender… because she was… was in the United State, so she’s more westernized? So he…so her way to show her express… to express his emotions is more… open? So, “my love” didn’t mean anything, is that right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	當然沒有啊。這就只是兩個感情很好的朋友，或者是很關心彼此的朋友之間的表達方式阿。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	So the former sentence she said?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的，她很擔心我，我們是工作上的夥伴。我請假兩天，她當然會想我啊。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean, she sent these messages just because you took two days off? Without your help in the class, she missed you a lot, is that so?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對，最主要就是那個概念，簡訊內容並不重要。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message, is sent in 2012, Jan. 13th, and is in evening 11:15…11:55, and is from the same person. (後面又翻成中文了orz) Can you tell me what these means? Why would she say something like this?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這封簡訊給我，主要是為了表示…主要是為了表達……怎麼用中文的方式表達。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she sent you these messages to help you on your assignment?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太曾經跟庭上所講過，我正在學習一個美國學位…一個碩士學位。在這個學程裡面，我被要求要完成三十個

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you just explain what exactly you’re study for you master program? For you master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的學位是英語教學。在這個學位裡面，主要是教有關英語教學，但是也會參雜著有關英語能力的學習，以及文化。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you mean you’re getting a TESOL degree, but that can include some English competence, is that right? ……some course about the culture, not English competence.

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，我記得至少有三門課是有關於文化和溝通。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	In these culture and communication courses, what assignments did you have?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	對每個學生來說，文化與溝通功課可能…對每個學生來說，都不一樣啊。就以我自己來舉例，我是一個在台灣試圖教…取得英語教學證明的外國人。為了證明我的能力，我必須證明我的中文能力。所以我有很多中英互翻譯的作業。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean because you wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so this degree ask you to prove your ability to use… Chinese? So you have to finished the assignment, and this assignment included sentence translation, is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對。而且我還被要求要加強我的口說和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So back to the former sentence… the former line, you said this is your assignment, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我記得這個句子。當我拿到這個中文句子的時候，我不知道怎麼把他翻成英文。你知道，有些中國字對外國人來說是很難認的。我需要一些幫助，所以我請我同事幫忙。我請她幫我翻譯這個句子，然後傳簡訊給我…傳答案給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean because you asked her how the sentence was said in…you send her the sentence in Chinese, and she translated it into English for you, and send you the answer, is that right? So this message is an answer for your assignment?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	And now please see the p.14 to 16 in the record. Please see the content. Are these all because you ask for help to your assignment, so the other person sent these to you?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，這些簡訊全都是為了我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So back to the point that you wife said you have an affair with your co-worker, Tsai-yian Wang, what’s your saying?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的事對這件事想太多了。我知道她對於支撐這個家的能力並不是非常滿意。但我希望法院…我希望庭上知道，在我的學習過程中，她從來沒有支持過我。她根本就不願意幫我完成我的學位。如果她能多支持我一點的話，我就不用向我同事求助了。我覺得她才是這整起誤會需要被…最需要…最主要負責的人。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	So according to you, I think…it seems that there are some friction… friction… fraction between you and your wife

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們剛結婚的時候，確實是一段好時光。但工作是我…是一個很大的問題。我想在台灣教葡萄牙文，但沒辦有有固定的授課時數，所以我的工作就變成了我們兩個之間的問題。我們為了這件事不知道已經吵了幾次架了。她不相信我已經盡了我最大的努力。她完全沒有辦法理解我所遇到的挫折以及我所遇到的問題。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	OK. Back to the master degree, the program you just mentioned. Can you tell me when your program begin? Is it end?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2010年的春天開始課程。那是個兩年的課程。我應該要在……2012年的12月之前完成課程。但是我並沒有如期完成，因為我…因為我一直在工作，所以我沒有辦法完成我的作業。就像我所說的，我的太太不怎麼支持我。我覺得我只有一個人在為學位奮鬥。我太累而且也太挫折了。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean you… you used to be a two-year program, and you failed to finish it. Why was that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法上完所有必需…要求的課程。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	 So your last registration semester, when did it end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一個註冊的學期是…2012的秋季班。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So if what you said was true… everything you said is true, your last course should be end at 2012, Nov. 15th. After that, you should not have any assignment, is that right? But your assignment text between you and your co-worker, kept… continued six months after your courses ended, how is that so?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒有完成那個課程，並不代表我不想增進我的中文能力…我的語言能力呀。雖然我沒有完成指定課程，但我還是想增進我的中文能力，所以我決定自修。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even you failed to finish that master degree program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，這就是為什麼我請我同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So this co-worker is playing a role that can call…can be called your…mentor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是個家教，她還是個真誠的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有。我曾經提供過這個想法，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	So, if you didn’t pay her, then why would she still send these message at the hour, at this late hour that she supposed to be rest, to be sleeped, to you? Is that beyond the co-worker obligation?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	就像我說的阿，她是一個非常真誠、非常支持的朋友。她利用她自己的私人時間來幫助我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teaching English at that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對，我還在那裏工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	And this co-worker, Tsai-yian Wang, still work here?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	對，她還在那裏教書，但我們現在不是搭檔。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Is there any person or investi…investi… evidence that the prosecutor want to do a further investigation? 

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope the court can call this Tsai-yian Wang as the witness to the court. Let her explain the true message behind these texts and why… and why she write…she wrote these messages to him.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there anything the court to do the further investigation for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had some action because of their relationship because of…because both of them. And they even try to persuade Tsai-yian Wang to leave the work. Is it possible to confirm this information to…to that cram school?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there anything you want to court to do the further investigation for you? Now here’s the thing, your degree, your program has already end at 20…2012, Dec. There is really no reason for you to say that your message is because she’s helping you to do your assignment. Especially your message usually were sent after 9 pm. And this is something normal people won’t… wouldn’t do. Do you have any evidence can help this case.

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我覺得庭上沒有甚麼可以為我調查的證據了。就像我說的，我和我同事之間的關係非常簡單，只想增進我的語文能力，學習中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So, we will dated at 2014, June 9th and in afternoon 4:30 to start to ask the witness. …to starting the procedure asking witness. Plaintiff and the defendant, please be here. If it is necessary, you can have your attorney here, do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	So today’s court is adjourned.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	Today we are here for the preparation procedure of case number 2887, adultery.

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國103年5月27日。」

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民或其他符合法律規定之資格，得請求法律服務。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are her for the preparation procedure for adultery. The plaintiff sued up for the case. It is because her husband John Anderston is in a relation with a teacher from his colleague. The plaintiff found some intimate messages from her husband’s phone. Plus, her husband, the defendant, usually have some excuses to stay in the cram school with his colleague王彩燕, and sometimes has some tele-conferencing. What the plaintiff has collected of the information are actually beyond the colleagues’ relationship. As a result, the plaintiff sued up. Defendant, your wife thinks you have affairs with you colleague. What’s your plead?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
en-US	當然沒有阿

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’ preparatory procedure, we are here for asking the messages between the defendant and his colleague. The purpose is to understand the defendant and his colleague really have intimate messages and even adultery. Do both parties of you fully understand your rights?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long do you marry your husband. Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have married for 4 years, and we have no kids.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you marry you husband in Taiwan or foreign countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the past a few years, did he only work for teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he is a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued his teaching. However, in Taiwan, Portuguese is not a famous English language, which is like English, so his teaching hours is not stable. Sometimes he will have even a period between jobs about two months. Afterwards, in order to make stable income, he started to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English. As a result, he seeks an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean he want to study a program in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he has to have a degree of English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California on the internet. So he don’t have to go to school but can have an on-line learning at home. After he finished all he course, he can got the master degree. His plan is that if he got the master degree in Taiwan, then he can also teach English. So what is the relationship between him and the person he has affair with?

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	They are colleagues of cram school.

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	The cram school plans a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher working together for a program, and the woman is his partner. 

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know they have some affairs?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I just noticed that my husband usually stayed at cram school for over work. I have asked him for many times. It is just a cram school. How could he work so much? He told me because he needs to partner with the Chinese teacher, so they need a lot of time to communicate and discuss. At first, I really didn’t think too much. But later I found he usually got some phone calls after he was home. And he usually picked up his phone in the study room rather with me. It seems like he wants to hide something, so I check his phone book.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Do you find anything weird in his phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone records, I found there is a number showing up for many times, Because I am curious about that, I check his test messages, too. After I checked his text messages, I found they text each other almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Just texting, it is not that serious. Is the content not appropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If that is just a common message, it’s okay. But he has got married, how could he text the kind of messages with other woman? I have provided some messages to the court. I think they are in the files.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please show the evidence record, number 13. Here are some text messages. Defendant, please check it. Are these from your phone’s text messages?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這是我手機裡面的簡訊內容

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I have a few questions about these messages. The first message is from 0958-932-XXX at 9:50 PM on December 31th, 2012, is that right? The content shows “I really miss you, my love.” What did it mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	那只是我同事傳給我的訊息，我記得那時候我請了兩天假，她只是太擔心了而已，這大概就是她為什麼會傳這樣的簡訊給我的原因，我同事是在美國受教育的，所以她比較開放一點，這就是她平常的說話方式跟表達方式，至於所提到的「我的愛」，只是我們平常用來稱呼我們比較親密在乎的人而已

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean the sender is that westernized because she stayed in United State for many years and the way she expresses herself is quietly open as well. So “my love”, this word means nothing. Is that right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	對阿，這在好朋友之間是很常見的，而且我們又是這麼熟的朋友

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	What about the sentence she just mentioned?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就如同我所說的，她只是擔心我，因為我們是工作上的同事阿，所以我沒去上班幾天，她想我也是滿正常的

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean that she sent this message to you just because you are not for work for two days. Because without your assistance, so she missed you a lot. That’s all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對阿就是這樣，簡訊內容根本沒有什麼問題啊

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message is from the same number at23:55 PM on January 13th in 2013. The content of the message is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this message mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳這封簡訊的目的只是要問我在中文裡面要怎麼表達這個句子的意思

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean she sent this message to you just to help you finish your homework? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	在我太太提告之前，我正準備要完成我的碩士學位，在這課程當中，我必須修滿30個學分才能結業，所以很自然地我當然必須完成一些練習還有作業阿

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain what’s your master degree about?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我學的是英語教學，在這課程當中，大部分跟英語教學有關，但有些也跟文化還有語言能力有關

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So what you got your master degree is a TESOL, and there are also some culture programs, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是阿，我記得當中至少有三門課程是跟文化有關係的

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So this kind of culture program… what kind of homework will it has?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	關於文化與溝通這方面，可能會因為不同學生而因人而異，拿我自己為例子，我是打算在台灣尋求英語教學資格，為了證明跟表達我自己能力，我必須展現出我對中文的掌握能力，因此在我的作業當中有很多中英互相翻譯的作業

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean you want to teach English in Taiwan so that the program ask you to prove the language competence of Chinese, is that right? So you have to finish some homework, and the homework is about sentence translating. Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對阿就是這樣，而且我也同時被要求要精進我自己的聽跟口說能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	OK that’s go back to what we just mentioned. You mean that this is your homework right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對阿，我還記得那個句子，當我拿到這個中文句子時，我實在不知道怎麼去翻譯，你知道有些中文的字對外國人來說是非常難去理解的，我需要一些協助所以我就請我的同事幫忙，我請她幫我翻譯並把句子傳給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You meant that you ask your colleague to tell you what’s the meaning, and she translates into English form and send it to you? In other words, the message is just the content of your homework?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，這封訊息真的只是我作業的答案

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	That’s take the documentary, the file from page 14 to page 16. Here are some contents of the messages. Please check these messages. Are these all out of your homework so you seek for your colleague’s help and she sent them back to you?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，所有的簡訊內容都只是幫助完成我的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So what’s your explain about your wife charged you and your colleague王彩燕have an affair?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了，我知道她覺得我能力不足以養整個家，我希望庭上了解，在我開始修課之後的所有期間，她從未提供我任何協助，她根本沒有想要幫助我完成學位的意思，如果她願意幫助我的話，我根本不需要向我的同事求助，我覺得她應該為這些所有誤會道歉

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your words, it seems like you and your wife have some misunderstanding and even unhappy?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們剛結婚時，一開始我們確實過得很開心，但問題出在我的工作，我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但沒有辦法有穩定的教學時數，所以我的工作變成我們之間的問題、導火線，我們為這件事情吵了很多次，她不肯相信我已經盡全力了，我也沒有辦法讓她了解我所面臨的困境和無力

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Ok let’s go back to your master degree you just mentioned. When did you start your master degree? Did it end already? 

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2010年的春季開始上課的，我必須要在12月22日完成這個課程，我並沒有完成我的學業，因為我同時在打工，而且沒有時間做我的作業，

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean the term of this program is two years long, but you didn’t finish it. Is that right?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法修完所有的課程

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	So when did you finish the course?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一次註冊的時間點是2012年的秋季

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you just mentioned, you course ended on December 5th in 2012, which means you won’t have any homework afterwards. Is that right? But you and your colleague still have some inappropriate messages after you finish your course for six months. What does that mean?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	即使我沒有繼續修課了不代表我沒有繼續增進我語言能力的意思，為了增進我的中文能力，我只能夠靠自己繼續練習下去

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean even you didn’t finish the program you still want to sharpen your Chinese skills?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫忙

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleague is just like your tutor, tight?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，她也是我的真心朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我曾經想過但是被她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her anything, why did she send these messages to you so late? Was that too much for a colleague doing this for you?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	這也是為什麼我說她是一個…很挺我的朋友阿，她用她自己的個人時間來幫助我學習中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still teaching in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是的，我還在那裡上班

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	What about your colleague, 彩燕王? Is she still working there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她還在那邊工作，但我們已經沒有再一起搭檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any further questions or any evidence that you want to ask?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena on 彩雲王, who works for the cram school, and come here to get some information. I would like to understand the background of these text messages between the defendant and his colleague.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Do you want the court to help you investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had some actions against their affairs. And even the cram school officers tried to ask 彩燕王 to leave the job. Can the court check this from the cram school?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you? Your work has already ended at December 5th 2012, you have no excuses to text messages with 彩燕王 for finishing assignments. Especially your text interactions are at night after 9 o’clock. That’s weird. Do you have any evidence that can help you with the case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到任何庭上可以代替我去調查的證據，就如同我所說，我同事跟我之間的傳訊內容就真的這麼單純而已，我只是希望她能過增進我的中文能力，然後幫助我繼續學習中文下去

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So the next court date will at 4:30 PM on June 9th in 2014 for the inquiry procedure of the witness. The plaintiff and the defendant, both of you need to show up. If necessary, both of you can have a lawyer.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白了

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	OK then we will end the court here

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case, case number 2887.

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國103年5月27日。」

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民或其他符合法律規定之資格，得請求法律服務。
en-US	Second, you have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low income family, a medium-low income family, or if you are an aborigine or meet other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	Third, you have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you with your case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The plantiff, Yu-Hua Chen filed for this case mainly because her husband John Anderson has a very intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school…from a cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cell phone. And…in addition, the defendant often say that…he is going to work extra hours or do tele-conferencing with his colleague, Tsai-Yian Wang. The messages which the plaintiff found…was not only just colleague relationship. As a result, she filed for the case. Defendant, your wife filed an adultery case against you. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然是無罪。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	Today this procedure…we’re going to confirm the details of the messages of the defendant and his colleague. We would like to make sure that if they really committed adultery and constitute the crime of adultery. Do both of you understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	 I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you and your husband been married? Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years. We don’t have children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you and your husband get married in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	My husband and I met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and taught Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in the past few years, is his job teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued teaching Portuguese. However, in Taiwan Portuguese is not that popular, so his teaching hours was not…teaching hours were not that stable. Sometimes he has periods between jobs for like…one or two months. After that, in order to get more stable income, he decided to start teaching English. However, his mother tongue is not English…he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You said that he was going to seek for an advanced degree, do you mean that he’s going to study a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Because he hoped that he could teach English, he had to get a degree of teaching…English teaching. He found a distance learning program on the internet which is provided by California. In this case, he didn’t have to go to the United States. He only had to do online learning. After he got all the credits, he can get…master degree. His plan is that after he got this English teaching degree, he can teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what is his relationship with this person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues…in cram school…in the cram school he works for. The plan of the cram school is that foreign teacher partner with Chinese teacher, and that woman is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know that they committed…he committed adultery?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	In the beginning, I just found that he stayed at school to work extra hours. I asked him several times: it’s just an English cram school, what is the need of working extra hours? He told me that because he had to partner with the Chinese teacher, he had to spend much time to communicate…spend much time communicating. In the beginning, I didn’t doubt him at all. However, I found that he often had some phone calls after work. When he got the phone call, he would never talk in my presence, he would go to the study room. This…I doubt because of this, so I checked his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	What did you see in his cell phone then? Something unusual…anything unusual?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I often see the same number in his calling record, so I was quite curious and looked at his messages…checked his messages. After I checked his cell phones, I found that he messaged with this…with a woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	What is big about sending messages? Is the content not appropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	 If it’s something very usual, I won’t really care, but he’s a married man, how can he let the other one send messages which is a bit…vague? In the past, I have already provided some contents of the messages. They should be in the documents.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please look at page 13 of the document. Here are some contents…here of the contents of the messages. Defendant, please take a look. Is these…are these the messages in your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，是我簡訊的內容。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	So now I’m going to focus on the content of the messages…I’ll ask you some questions. The message is send by the phone number 0958-932*** in November 31st, 2012 at 9:50 PM. The content is “我非常想念你,”What does this mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	就是我同事傳的啊。我記得那個時候我請了兩天假，她有點擔心。那就是為什…所以她才傳這樣的簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，所以很開明…開放，那就是她講話的方式。就是…「my love」這樣的詞就只是我們叫我們關心的人的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that this woman stayed abroad, so her thoughts are more westernized? And the way her…she expressed her feelings is more…open-minded? So the phrase “my love” doesn’t really mean anything, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	對啊，那是好朋友之間，或是很關心彼此的朋友表達的方式…稱呼彼此的方式。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the previous sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	我就說了，她…她很關心我，我們是工作上的好夥伴。當我請假兩天，他很自然地就會想念我啊

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	 You mean that the woman sent you this message just because you took two days off? Because you didn’t…you weren’t there to help her in class, she missed you? Is that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊，內容就是這樣子，根本沒什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	So let’s look at the second message which is sent at 11:55 PM, January 13th, 2013 by the same person. 內容是我想要你在我身邊，我們什麼時候可以在一起？What does this mean? Why do you have that sentence in your cell phone?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫那句話是想告訴我一句中文該怎麼說。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she sent you this message because she was helping you finishing your homework. What does this mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我妻子提到的，我現在正在修碩士課程。在那個學位中，我要修完三十個學分才能拿到學位。那我當然就要…完成一些練習、作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you please explain which program you are studying?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士課程是英語教學。這個課程主要就是英語教學，然後還會有一些文化語言…文化方面的東西還有語言能力等等。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you’re studying for the TESOL program, so there are some cultural lessons in that program, is that true? Is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，我記得至少有三門課是跟文化與溝通有關的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what kind of assignments do you have from these cultural communication course?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	對每個學生來說，這堂課的作業都不太一樣。我以我自己來說的話，我是在台灣然後想要成為一位英文老師。為了要拿到這個學位、表示我有能力，我也要證明說我的中文是很好的。所以很多我作業的內容都是中英翻譯的句子。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you plan to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove that you have sufficient Chinese competence, is that right? So you have to finish some assignments in class, and these assignments are about translating sentences…between Chinese and English, right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對啊，我也被要求就是要增進我的口語表達和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to the previous sentence. You said that they’re your assignments, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對啊，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這些…就是中文的句子的時候，我不知道英文怎麼講。你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說實在是太難了。我需要一些幫忙，所以請我的同事幫我。我請她翻譯一下那個句子，然後傳簡訊給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So you said that you didn’t know the meaning of that sentence, so you ask your colleague to send you the translation in English by message, is that right? So the content of the message is the answer of your assignment, right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，那個就是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	So how about…let’s look at the content of the messages on page 14 to 16 on the document. Please check the content. Is these messages sent by your colleague because you need help doing your assignment?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，所有的內容都是我要做作業所以傳的。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So what do you want to say to your wife saying that you committed adultery with your colleague, Tsai-Yan Wang.

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得她真的想太多了，關於這件事情。我知道她對我…對我照顧家庭的狀況不滿意。我想要讓法院知道的是，從我說我想要修這個學位開始，她就沒有提供任何的支持。她根本就不想要幫助我完成學位。如果她沒有這麼…如果她支持我的話，我就不會去尋求我同事的幫助。我覺得會產生這些誤會都是她的問題。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your words, the relationship between you two is a bit unpleasant, is that right?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	剛開始結婚的時候，確實相處得還不錯。但是問題就是…但是問題就是我的工作。我試著要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是授課時數就是不夠。然後我們兩個的關係就是因為我的工作變得不太好。我們為了這件事情…常常為了這件事情爭吵。她不相信我已經盡我所能了。我沒有辦法讓他了解我的…有多沮喪然後遇到的困難是什麼。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	OK, let’s go back to the master degree you were talking about. When did you start studying for your master degree. When did it end? Did you get the degree already?…Have you got the degree already?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我本來是在2010年的春天開始的…一開始。那是兩年的課程。我本來是應該是在2012年的12月完成這個學位。我之所以沒有準時拿到是因為我要工作…然後沒有辦法有時間去寫我的作業。就像我剛剛說的，我的老婆一直都沒有很支持我。我覺得我根本就是一個人在追求這個學位，我覺得很累很沮喪。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You said that this was a two-year program, and you didn’t finish it. Why is that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成所有的課程…修完所有的課程。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When did the semester you last registered ended?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	恩…是在2012月四月。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So…as you said, according to your saying, the course ended on December 5th, 2012. After that…you won’t have…you didn’t really have assignments, right? But the messages between you and colleague continued until…continued for another six months. Why is that?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我或許沒有想要把那個課程修完，但不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。就算我沒有修完那個學位，我還是想要增進我的中文能力，所以我開始自學。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even though you haven’t finished your English, you still want to let your Chinese become more fluent, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，所以為什麼我請我同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So this colleague is somehow like…a tutor of yours, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不是只是一個家教而已，而且還是一個真正的好朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我曾經要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	 If you didn’t pay her, why does she send messages in the middle of the night with such effort? Is that beyond colleague…relationships between colleagues?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我說這個朋友很支持我啊。她用她自己的時間幫助我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English at that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對，我還在那裡工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is this woman, Tsai-Yan Wang your colleague, still working there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	對啊，她還在那裡工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you want to investigate any further evidence?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena Wang…Tsai-Yan Wang, the colleague of the defendant, who works at Bo-Yuan Cram School. I hope that she can explain her relationship with the defendant and in what situation…under what circumstances are these messages sent.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Defendant, do you…what other evidences do you want us to investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has taken some action concerning the relationship between them. And the cram school even asked the woman, Tsai-Yan Wang, to leave her job. Is it possible for…to check with the cram school about this matter?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Now, defendant, do you want to ask the court to investigate any evidence for you? The situation is…you have already completed…the courses have already been completed on December 5th, 2012. There…it is not acceptable that doing assignment is an excuse for Tsai-Yan Wang sending messages to you. Especially the time you send messages is always after 9 PM, that is quite doubtful. Do you have evidence which can help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到任何法庭可以為我調查的證據。就像我說的，我們傳簡訊的原因非常簡單，我只是想要增進我的語言能力，然後繼續學中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So…the next court will be set at 4:30 PM, June 9th, 2014. We will inquire the witnesses. Plaintiff, defendant, both of you please come to the court. If it is necessary, you can both have lawyers, is that OK?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	OK, this will be the end of this preparatory procedure.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparation procedure. The plaintiff had filed the case mainly because her husband John Anderston had intimate relationship with his co worker and the plaintiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cell phone. Her husband always stay late at the cram school or tele-conferencing with his co worker at midnight. The behavior had already beyond co worker relationship .So she filed the case. Defendant, your wife suspect you of violating the crime law of adultery. What is your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparation procedure, we are going to ask questions about the relationship between the defendant and the co worker. The purpose is to find out whether the defendant has violated the criminal crime which is adultery and……..do the both parties understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long has you been married with your husband? Do you have a child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married ofr 4 years and we don’t have a child.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	So Did you married your husband in Taiwan or at other countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We meet ,…I met mu husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan because he wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the past years, his job is a Portuguese teacher, isn’t he? 

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a language in Taiwan that many people want to learn so his teacher hour is not stable. Sometimes he will have a period between jobs and the period may aim up to one or two months. So… hu… he started to teach English because he wants to have a more stable income. However, his mother tongue is not English so he decided to seek an advanced degree class for English.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that he would like to seek an advanced degree, do you mean that he want a degree n Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No , because he wanted to teach English , so what ..the degree he need is TESOL which means teaching English for speakers of other language .he found a distance teaching program in America …..in California, America on the internet. So he could finish the program by online learning,,, without …. He didn’t have to fly to America. After he finished the program, he could get a master degree. His plan was to … to get a degree by.. by finish finish …the program.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what is the relationship between the husband and the co- worker.

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are classmates in the cram school.The cram school provide teachers both Chinese teachers and foreign teachers. And the woman is a partner with my husband in the cram school.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	Hw do you know they have intimate relationship?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	First I found that my husband always stay late at the cram shoo. I asked him many times that it was just a English cram school why did he stay so long in the school? He told me that he had to partner the Chinese teacher, the woman so they have to corporate with each other, there are many things to be dealed. At first I did not doubted him. But after some time, I found that he always pick some calls after he came home. And he didn’t pick up the phone in form of me, he usually go to the study room for picking the phones. Then so I suspect.. those are the reasons I suspect him. So I checked his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything unusual in this cell phone.

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I saw one number appeared form time to time. I was curious about that so I checked his text messages too. After I checked that I found he almost has text messages with that woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Though they are text messages… that are fine right? Or the content is not appropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it is just a normal message, that will be fine. But he is a married man. How could he let a woman send intimate messages to him? I had provided some messages content that they should be in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please check investigatory file 1 page13In this file, here are some messages record, defendant, please checkArte these same messages with those messages in your phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對這是我手機裡的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I am going to ask some questions about those messages.The first text message was send on 9:50 in the evening on 11/31,2012. Form a number which is 0958-932===. The content is 我非常的想你 請你解釋這是什麼意思

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這次我一個同事發的 我記的那天 我休了兩天假 她是很擔心吧 所以她才會那封寄簡訊給我 我同事在美國受教育 她很開放 那是他講話表現 至於我的愛 那就是我們對我們關心的人的稱呼

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean the person who sends this message had stayed in the US so she is westernialized? And she is open-minded in expressing herself her emotions. So these words “my love did not mean a lot, isn’t it?”

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	這在好朋友之間的使用很正常

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the previous sentence she type?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的 他很關心我 我們是公事上的夥伴 當我休了兩天假的後 他很自然就想我拉 

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean she send this message to you just because you were  you took two days off? Because without your corporation or assistance, she missed you? is that all? 

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對這就是簡訊就沒什麼 內容很正常

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was send to you at 11:55 in the evening, 1/31, 2013. It was also form the same number. 內容是我想要你在身邊 我們什麼時候才能真正在一起 please explain it? Could you tell me why she send it to you?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫那封簡訊是為了告訴我中文作業該如何表達

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean she send this message to you mainly for helping you with your assignment, what do you mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太已經告訴法官 我正在參加一個含授課程 在那個城裡我被一球要修滿302個學分 我才能結業 當然我也需要做一些練習還有作業

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you explain what are you studying for your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是英語教學 在這個學程裡有一些是關於英語教學 文化還有一些是語言能力的

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So the degree you are taking is English teaching but you still have some culture communication lessons? Is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對 我記得至少有三堂課程是跟文化溝通有關的

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So could you tell me what assignment was given in this culture and communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	每個學生的文化溝通作業不盡相同 以我來說 我是一個在台灣的學生 而且我想要拿到 英語教學的學位   為了達到這個目標 我必須展現我的語言能力 由其是中文的掌握 所以我的很多作業是關於中文英文的翻譯

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean because you plan to teach English in Taiwan so the master degree asks you ti have some certificate for the language competence is that right? So you have to finish some assignment and the assignment is about Chinese and English translation, is that right? 

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對 沒錯 我還被要求要加強我的寫作和口語能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Ok lets go back to the question that you said it was your assingmnet

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對我記得那句話 當我拿到這個句子 我不知道要怎麼把它翻成英文你知道 對於外國人來說有些中文字很難理解 我需要一些幫助 所以我請我的同事幫我 我請她幫我翻譯那些話而且用簡訊寄給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean you asked her to translate it for you, so she sent it in message to you, is that right? So the message is only the answer for the translation question?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊的內容就是我翻譯題的答案

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	And now please check investigatory file 1 page 14-16 All of these content. Please check this content. All of these message are sent on the purpose ofhelping you with the homework so you have got the messages. 

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對 所有這些簡訊目的都是為了完成我所有的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So as for the suspect that your wife suspect you to have a affair with 王彩華 what will you say about that?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太想太多了 我知道他對於我養家的能力不是很滿意我想要讓法院知道的是 它在我一開始參加這個課程時 一點都不支持我 她跟本不願意幫助我完成我的學位 如果她能更支持我一點 我就不用去問我的同事要答案了 我覺得她要為全部的誤解負責任

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you just said  I thought you may have some fights with your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們婚姻一開始的時候 我們的確曾有過一些很好的時光但我的工作一直是個問題 我試著在台灣蕉葡萄牙文 但工作時數一值不是很穩定 之後我的工作變成我們吵架的原因 我們之間的問題我們會這是三不五時就會吵架  他不相信我已經盡力了 而且我沒有辦法壤她知道我的挫折還有沮喪 

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Ok now let’s turn back to the degree you just mentionedWhen did you start the program did you get the degree?When will it end?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010 春天開始這個課程那是一個兩年的課程 我本來在12/22應該完成這個課程 我沒有完成學位因為我有再打工 所以我沒有完成課程所要求的作業  就像我說的 我太太一直沒有很支持我 我感覺我是自己再硬撐著拿到那學位 我後來變得很累而且很挫折

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean the program is a two year term program but in the end you did not finish it, why ?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法達到課程要求

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	So when did the last semester that you registered end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期結束在2012年秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So if you are telling the truth, the end of the semester is at 12/5,2012 after that you would not have any assignment for the course. But the messages between you and the co-worker still continue for 6 months after you finished ….. you stop the program.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒有拿到學位 但不代表我不想要提升我的語言能力 雖然我沒有拿到學位但我仍想要讓我的中文變好所以我自己學中文

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that although you did not complete the degree but you still want to upgrade your Chinese language ability so that you could speak a more fluent Chines, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對 這就是為什麼我請我同事幫忙

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the co worker is as a tutor for you in your case?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是一個家教更像一個朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有 我有提議要付她錢 但她拒絕

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you did not pay her why did she have to reply the message at midnight the time that people should have already fallen asleep? Is this already beyond things that a co worker should do?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	那就是為什麼我說她是一個非常支持我的朋友他用他所有時間來幫助我學中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English at that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對我仍然在那工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does the co worker 王采燕still work there ?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也在那工作 不過我們不再是夥伴

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor , is there anything evidence that you want the court to investigate or anyone witness ?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena王采燕who is working at the 伯元 cram school to be in court as a witness. And we would want her to explain the relationship she had between her and the plaintiff and we want her to explain the relationship or background information for the messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? 

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had done some actions because of the relationship they have and the cram school even tried to persuade 王采燕to quit her job . I would like to verify this with the cram school.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? The situation now is that the program is end on 12/5, 2012 . There is no reason that you could explain the relationship you and the co worker for helping the assignment. Especially, the interaction always start at 9:00 in the night. It is very doubtful.

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到法院能找到幫助我的證據 就像我說的我和同事間的簡訊非常平常 我只是想要提升我的中文能力且繼續學中文

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court day is set at 4:30 in the afternoon, 6/9, 2014 To do the inquiry for the witness. Both the plaintiff and the defendant should be in court on that day. Is necessary, both of you have a right to a lawyer, do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	 I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	First, you have the right to remain silent. You do not need to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民或其他符合法律規定之資格，得請求法律服務。
en-US	Second, you have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low-income family, a medium-and-low income family, or if you are an aborigine, or meet any other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	…You have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence that may help you with your case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我瞭解。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today this is the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. This case was filed by the plaintiff, Yu-hua Chen. The main reason for doing so is because the plaintiff’s husband is beyond a workers’ relationship.The plaintiff has discovered intimate messages in the defendants’ text mailbox. In addition, the defendant would make excuses … often make excuses to stay after work and frequently teleconference with his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang.…The information the plaintiff collected proves that the relationship is beyond a working relationship between colleagues.Therefore, she filed the case. The defendant, your wife accuses you of adultery. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然是無罪啦。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In our preparatory procedure today, our main goal is to inquire the details of the messaging between the defendant and your colleague. Our objective today is to make sure that the defendant really is committing adultery with a colleague. Are the two parties aware of the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you been married to your husband. Do you have any children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years. We don’t have any children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Were you married in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. 4 years ago he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the recent years, he… has been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we just met, he was a Portuguese Teacher. After we were married, he continued to teach Portuguese. Portuguese is not a language popular among Taiwanese so his teaching hours were… unstable.Sometimes he would have empty…hours up to two months.Afterwards, to obtain a more stable income, he began to teach English. But English was not his mother tongue so he decided to seek advanced education.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	By advanced education, do you mean he sought a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Since he wished to teach English in Taiwan, the degree he sought must be related to English Education. He found a long distance online course from California of the United States… online. So he didn’t need to go to America in person to take the class. So when he obtains all his credits, he also gets his masters degree. His plan was to find an English teacher position in Taiwan through getting a degree from the United States. 

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What is the relationship he has with the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are collegues at the cram school. The cram school has a policy to partner up mandarin teachers and foreign teachers. That woman is the mandarin teacher partnered up with him.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they were in an affair

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first I only found that my husband often stayed long after work hours. I asked many times: It was only an English cram school, why would he need to stay so often after work? He told me that since he had to partner up with a Mandarin teacher, there had to be much effort put in to communicating with each other. At first I didn’t suspect anything at all. Later on, I found that after he would come home, he would receive phone calls. When he picks up the phone, he would never talk on the phone in person, but go to his study room instead. Because of this, I began to suspect him, so I inspected his phone record.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	…Did you find anything unusual in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his call records, there was… one number that frequently appeared. So I was… curious and began to inspect his text messages, too. And then I realized he was texting a woman almost everyday.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Is it really that serious?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it’s a normal, an usual text then there wouldn’t be any problem. But he is a married man, how could he let another person send intimate messages to him like that? Previously, I’ve sent some copies of their text messages of theirs to the court, they should be in the evidence right now.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Evidence number one, please. Page 13. There are a few message contents in here. May the defendant please take a look at them? Are these the text messages that are in your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對，這是我手機裡的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Then I have some questions to ask you about these messages. The first text message was sent from the phone number 0958-932XXX at 9:50 PM of November 21st 2012. The content is: “I really miss you, my love.” What does this mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	呃，這是我同事寄給我的。我記得我當時有兩天沒去上班。她有點擔心我。所以才傳這封簡訊給我。我的同事去美國留過學，所以非常開放，這是她講話的方式。至於她稱呼我為「my love」,這只是他對在乎的人表達的意思。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean the person who sent this message was educated in America, she’s more westernized. She’s more open with expressing her affections. So, by calling you my love there isn’t any meaning?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	不，這是好朋友之間很常有的用語，只是表達對彼此的在乎。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	What about the previous message before this… name?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我先前提到的，她只是為我擔心而已，我們是同事的關係。我有兩天沒去上班，她自而然地…為我擔心。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	What you mean is the only reason for her doing so is you took two days off from work? And because you were not there to help her in class, she missed you? Is that it?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊，那就是整件事情的脈絡。沒什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	All right. The second text message was also sent from the same cell phone number from 11:55pm of January 13th 2013. Inside the text message, it says, “I want to be by your side, when can we be truly together?” What does this mean? Why would a message like this appear in your cellphone?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳這個訊息給我是想要告訴我我作業裡的回答要怎麼講。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean she sent you this text message to help you with your homework? What do you mean by that?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我妻子在法庭中提到的，我當時在修一堂課。那堂課需要修滿30個學分我才能取得學位，所以我當然需要完成一些作業和練習。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you please elaborate on what you really are learning for your masters?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我修的是英語教育的課程。期中，有些課程是漢英語教學相關。有的是漢西方文化或語言能力有關。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So your seeking a TESOL masters degree, some courses are related to culture?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三堂課與文化和傳播有關係。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	Then, what kind of an assignment would you have to finish for the courses in culture and communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	每個學生會收到的作業可能都不同。舉我自己的例子來說吧，我人在台灣，然後想要找一份英語教學的工作。為了達成這個目標，然後展現我的能力，我必須表現出我對中文的瞭解。所以我的作業很多都是和中英翻譯有關係。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	What you mean is that because you are seeking a job to teach English in Taiwan, the homework requires you to have Chinese competence as well? So you have to finish certain assignments in your course, and they are often related to Chinese-English translation.

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，當然我還被要求要有口說還有寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	OK, let’s go back to what we mentioned before, you said this was your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我記得那句話。當我拿到中文句子時，我不知道英文剛怎麼說。你知道的，有很多中文的句子對外國人來說很難理解。我需要一些幫助，所以我同事來幫我。我請她幫我翻譯那個句子，再把答案寄給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So the situation was… you gave the Chinese sentence to your colleague and she sent back the English translation of it? So this text message was only an answer for an assignment?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊就只是作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	OK, then, let’s take a look at Evidence number 1, page 14 to 16. Please take a look at the content. Are the reason behind sending all these text messages, your homework assignment?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，所有的簡訊都是要幫助我回答我作業的問題。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then may I ask you, may you explain that your wife is accusing you of having an affair with your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了。我知道她對我很不滿意，就在于沒辦法照顧好家庭上。法官我希望你知道，從我開始攻讀碩士到現在她一直沒有支持我。她一點也不想幫助我完成學業。她要是更支持我一點，我才不需要請我同事來幫我。我想這所有的誤解應該怪在她身上才對。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, there seems to be an unhappy relationship between the two parties.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們剛結婚的時候，我們的確度過了一些美好的時光。但是我的失業就是一個很大的問題。我嘗試要找到教葡萄牙文的工作，但沒辦法取得很穩定的工作時數，所有工作問題就成為我們兩個人之間的阻礙。我們時常為了這件事情吵架。她不認為我已經盡力了。我也真的沒辦法認清我的狀況與我面臨的問題。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Ok, then, let’s return to the Masters degree you mentioned. When did your courses begin? Did you finish all your courses? Did you obtain your degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始上課。它是一個兩年的課程。我本來能在2012年十二月完成學位的。但我最後沒有取得學位，因為當時有堅持的工作然後不夠時間去完成作業。就像我先前提到的，我老婆並不太支持我。我覺得我是孤單一個人地在爭取這個學位。我開始感到累，然後煩惱。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So you mean this…degree requires two years, two terms. But you didn’t finish your degree, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法去達到所有的課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	And when did your last term that you were registered in school end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一學期是2012年的秋天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If what you say is true, then your final term ends at September 12th 2012. And by then all your homework assignments have ended. But you continued to sent text message after the end of your course for over 6 months, how do you explain this?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我雖然沒有拿到學位、沒有完成這些課程，但這並不代表我不想繼續讓我英文進步啊！雖然我沒有完成我的課程，但我想不斷讓我的語言能力進步，所以我繼續努力。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So what you mean is that although you didn’t finish your masters courses, you wanted to improve your Mandarin on your own, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，這就是為什麼我找我同事幫我。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	Then the role your colleague takes is kind of like your tutor, is that right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不單只是我的家教，也是我真心的好朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我有主動提出要給她錢，但她拒絕我了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, then why did she reply your text messages late at night when she supposedly should be asleep? Doesn’t this exceed what colleagues do to help each other?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個很支持人的朋友。她犧牲她自己的時間來幫我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still teaching English at that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是，我還在那邊工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is your coworker Tsai-Yen Wang still working there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也正在那邊工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, are there any witnesses you wish to subpoena or evidences you wish to show?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I wish to subpoena the defendant’s coworker Tsai-Yen wang from the cram school. I would like her to explain the relationship she has between her and the defendant, and her reason for sending the text messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, are there any evidence that you wish for the court to investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard the cram school has taken some actions in response to the relationship between those two people. Somebody has tried to ask Tsai-Yen Wang to leave her position. I wonder if the cram school can… if there are any evidence to show this fact?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Now, the defendant, are there any evidence you wish for the court to help you investigate? The current situation is your degree courses have ended on December 5th 2012. Homework assignments is no excuse for the texting between you and Tsai-Yen Wang. Especially when your text messages are mainly sent after 9 PM at night. This arises suspicion. Do you have any evidence that may help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到任何證據可以請法院幫我調查的。就像我之前提到的，我和我同事往來的原因其實很簡單：我只想讓我的中文進步，然後不斷地練習中文而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next…witness… the next court for the case will be on June 9th 2014, 4:30PM. The plaintiff and the defendant are required to come to court in person. If it is necessary, you can all appoint lawyers, do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	OK, our court ends here.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	Today we’re here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case, case number 888.

en-US	Do you fully understand you rights? 

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	了解

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today, we’re here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. Yu-Hua Chen filed this case. The main reason is that her husband, John Anderson sent intimate messages to his colleague working at the cram school. The person who filed this case checked the messages of her husband and found some intimate messages. Moreover, the defendant would make up some reasons, umm..for example, to have extra working hours in order to teleconference with his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang. The intimate messages the plaintiff has found out were beyond coworker’s relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff decided to file this case. Defendant, you have violated the adultery, what is your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然無罪啊

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, our main goal is to ask for the details of the intimate messages sent between the defendant and his colleague, so that we can confirm whether the defendant and his colleague do constitute adultery. Do both parties understand our procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, plaintiff, how long have you been married to your husband? Do you two have any children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We’ve been married for four years, and we do not have any children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Were you married in Taiwan or in a foreign country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan in order to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	Then for the past few years, has his work always been teaching Portuguese? 

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, and after we got married, he was still teaching Portuguese. However, among Taiwanese, Portuguese is not a very prevalent and famous language. Therefore, his teaching hours are not too many. Sometimes, he even had a period between a month or two between jobs. Afterwards, in order to have a more stable income, he decided to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English; therefore, he decided to learn English and seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	What you mean by “seeking an advanced degree” is that he planned to pursue a higher degree in Taiwan? 

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	 No. He hopes to teach English in Taiwan; therefore, he needs to receive a degree which is related to English TESOL, and he found a distance learning program which is launched in California. Through this distance learning program, he’s able to learn online without flying to America. Therefore, after receiving the credits, he will be able to receive a master’s degree. His plan was that through getting this master’s degree, he will be able to teach English in Taiwan. 

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then I would like to ask what is the true relationship between his and the person who he had an affair with? 

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	Well, they are colleagues at the cram school. At the cram school, the woman was partnered with my husband, and the woman was a Chinese teacher, and my husband an English teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	Then how can you proof that they did have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	Well, at the beginning, I just noticed my husband often worked for longer hours at the cram school. And I asked him many times about how come? It was just a cram school! There’s no need, no way to have longer working hours. He told me that he needed to discuss about teaching matters and communicate with his Chinese partner. Therefore, at the beginning, I didn’t doubt him at all. But afterwards, I’ve found out that he will often receive calls after work. The strange this was, when he was answering these calls, he would just go back to his study room and answer the calls instead of answering them in front of me. Therefore, this made me very skeptical of him, and I checked his mobile phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Then did you find anything wrong or anything strange?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	Well, I’ve found out that one number appeared very, very often in his cell phone record. Therefore, I was so curious that I checked his instant messages. Then, I found out that he sent messages with a woman nearly every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	It’s just merely messages. How about the content? Are they unusual or intimate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If they were just normal messages, then I’m okay with that. However, he is married to me, how can he allow that woman to send him such intimate messages? I provided some content of the messages to the court earlier. I believe they’re in the folder. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Let’s look at evidence one, page thirteen. Defendant, please take a look at some of the messages here. Were these messages the same with the messages in your cell phone? 

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的。一模一樣。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	 Then I would ask you some questions according to these messages. The first message appears to be sent by someone, whose number was 0958932, at 9 pm, November 31, 2012, and the content was, I really miss you, my love.” What does this mean? 

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	喔，那是我同事發給我的啊。我記得我那時候請假，請了兩天。她那時很擔心我吧。那就是為甚麼她會發那一封訊息給我。而且她是在美國長大、受教育的，所以她是一個非常開放的女生。那就是她講話的方式和表達的方式啊。至於「我的愛」，只是互相叫對方會用的辭啊，並沒有代表甚麼意思。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Okay, so do you mean that the person who sent this message to you was westernized because she was educated in the US? Therefore, she was very open with her feelings, and the word “my love” doesn’t mean anything, is that right? 

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	對啊，當然沒有意思啊， 因為那只是親密的朋友或好朋友之間的稱呼而以。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	Then how about the previous sentence that she sent? 

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	我剛剛已經提到了，她那時候非常擔心我，而且我們是工作夥伴! 我兩天沒去工做啊，她當然會想我啊!

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Okay, what you mean is, because you haven’t been to work for two days; therefore you colleague missed you and was worried about you? Moreover, without your assistance, she missed you? Was that merely the reason? 

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊，內容就是這樣子，所以我的那一封訊息根本不算甚麼啊!

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Okay, let’s look at the second message, sent by the same person at 11:55 pm, January 13, 2013. The content was, “I want you by my side, when will we be together?” So what did this sentence mean? Why did this person want to send you this sort of content?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	因為她要教我如何用中文表達這一種內容。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Oh, so you mean she sent you this message in order to teach you, assist you, explain to you how to translate sentences? What does this mean? 

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太跟庭上說的，我正在攻讀碩士學位。要順利拿到學位，我必須拿到30學分。當然是要做一些作業、一些練習啊。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Please explain clearly to me, what were you studying for concerning your master’s program? 

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	就是英語教學的碩士學位啊。在學位裡面，還有分英語教學的課程、文化的課程、和交流的課程。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that this master’s degree was mainly about English teaching; however, you are also studying about culture interaction, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，至少有三門課是跟文化交流、溝通相關的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what sort of assignment will be assigned in these courses? 

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	每個人所被分配到的作業不一樣。因為我现在在台灣，希望找到一份英語教學的工作。因此，為了達成這個目標，我必須能證明我有足夠的中文能力。因此我有很多作業都是有關中英字句的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So you mean that because you planned to teach English in Taiwan; therefore, this master’s degree will be able to proof that you have enough Chinese language competence? Therefore, you have the finish the assignments being assigned in these courses, and the assignments include Chinese and English sentence translation? 

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對沒錯，而且我有必須加強我口說和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay, then let’s start again. You said that this was your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我記得。當我拿到那一份作業的時候，我不知道它是甚麼意思。而且你知道，對有些外國人來說，有些中文字句非常難懂。因此，我非常需要幫助，所以我就問了我的同事啊。我請她幫我翻那一句話，然後透過簡訊傳給我答案。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Okay, so what you mean was that at that time, you first sent the Chinese version of that sentence, and she helped you translate it and sent you that sentence in English? Is that right? And that means this message was just the answer to your assignment? 

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	沒錯，只是作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	 Okay, then let’s take a look at evidence one, page 14 to 16, and let’s take a look at all the content of all the messages. Please, just take a look at these contents. And the main reason was, because you want to finish your assignment, and you asked your colleague to translate them for you? 

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯，所有的訊息都是因為我要完成我的作業，拿到答案，所以才會有這些訊息。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then how about your wife filing the adultery case against you and your colleague Ms. Tsai-Yen Wang? 

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太對於這事真的想太多了。我知道她對於我提供家庭一些資金啊不是很滿意。在此，我想告訴庭上，我在攻讀碩士學位期間，我太太從來沒有關心我。而且她也沒有協助我完成我的碩士學位。如果她願意支持我、幫助我的話，那我也不會請我的同事幫我啊。所以我覺得她才是要被責怪的對象。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your saying, it seems that between you and your wife, the relationship is not very good. 

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	結婚後的一段時間，我們相處確實很好啦。但是最大的問題在於我有沒有工作。我在台灣試著教葡萄牙語，但是我的時數很少。因此這個問題就成了我們兩人之間的一到牆。我們為這件事就一直吵架，吵了好多次。她不認為我已經盡力了。她也不了解我面臨這種窘境的時候，感到多受挫、多憤怒。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, then let’s go back to the master’s degree that we’ve just mentioned. When did you start that master’s program? Did you receive a master’s degree? Has it ended?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在春季2011年入學的。我需要攻讀兩年。我應該是要在103年的12月就要完成這個學位。但是因為那時我兼職，導致我無法準時完成我的學位，因為沒時間寫作業。如同我剛剛所提的，我太太一點都沒支持我。結果我那時就覺得非常的無助啊，好像是我自己孤拎拎的要拿到那個學位。因此我感到非常的勞累、受挫。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	Okay, so you said that this master’s degree requires a two-year study; however, you didn’t received that degree on time, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	因為我無法如期完成課程所需的作業。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	Then when was the last date you registered for the program? 

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	是在103年的秋季班註冊。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	According to your statement, the semester that you finished the course would be December 5, 2012, and after your complete that semester, you won’t have any assignment, right? However, the colleague kept sending your messages six months after your study, why was that

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我那時候是還沒有拿到碩士學位，但是那又並不代表我不想增進我的語言能力。縱使我沒有拿到那個學位，我依然想要我的中文能力進步啊，自己字學啊。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that even if you didn’t successfully get that master’s degree, you still hope to improve you Chinese ability, is that so?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對啊，而且那就是為什麼我會尋求我的同事幫助。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the role that your colleague was playing equals to your mentor? 

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，還是我真正的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Then, did you pay her? 

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有喔，沒有付錢給她。我有提過要付給她，但是她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t even pay her, then why would she be willing to send you messages in the middle of the night, when she could just sleep? Don’t you think that this was just beyond coworker’s relationship? 

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	我才會說她是一個非常好的朋友啊。她願意占用她自己的時間，幫助我。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still teaching at that same cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是的，我還是在那裏工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So, is your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang still working at that cram school, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	對，她還在那裏工作，但我們已經不是搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Does the prosecutor need to subpoena or have other witnesses? 

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena the defendant’s coworker Tsai-Yen Wang who works at Po-Yuan cram school, and come here as witness. I would ask her to clearly state the background and goal of the messages she sent to the defendant.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, do you wish the court to investigate on any evidence? 

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I’ve heard that the cram school has already taken some action against the relationship between them. About their action, they have persuaded Tsai-Yen Wang to quit her job. I would like to ask whether it is possible to verify this issue. 

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Now, currently, the situation is that you finished your master’s degree on December 5, 2012, Therefore, making an excuse of doing an assignment with Tsai-Yen Wang is not really reasonable. Especially, the interaction between you two often appears after 9 pm. That makes one very, very skeptical. Do you have any evidence which may help you with your case? Now, let me ask the defendant, what would you like the court to investigate on the case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	沒有，我並沒有證據要庭上代表我去偵查。之前已經提過了，我和同事之間的交流、互動是非常簡單的。只是想要增進我的語文能力，繼續學中文啊。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The court will set the time to ask the witness to come to the court at 4:30 pm, June 9, 2012. The plaintiff and the defendant need to come to the court. And if it’s necessary, each party can ask for a lawyer.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	The court is adjourned.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國103年5月27日。」

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是，我了解。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The plaintiff, Yu-Hua, Chen, filed this case. The reason for the plaintiff to file this case is that her husband, John Anderston, is beyond co-workers’ relationship with a person. The plaintiff found some intimate messages and records in the defendant’s cell phone. Furthermore, the defendant, John Anderston, found reasons for working late in the cram school and conducted tele-conferencing with Chai-yan Wang. The contents collected by the plaintiff were beyond co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, your wife is wondering whether you have an affair with others, so she accused you.

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然無罪。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the court will focus on the details of these tele-conferencings and intimate messages. The purpose of this procedure is to see whether the interactions between John Anderston and Chai-yan Wang constitute the adultery. Did both parties understand this procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff. How long have you got married with the defendant? Did you have a child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years, and we don’t have any child.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or other countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the past years, his job in Taiwan is to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we knew each other initially, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan; his teaching hours were not stable. Sometimes, there had been a period between works for months. In order to have stable incomes, he decided to teach English instead. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek a advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he wanted to seek a advanced degree. Did he want to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan. The degree he wanted to get is about English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California in the United Stated on the Internet. This program allowed him to learn by on-learning, so he didn’t have to go abroad. After he finished all the courses of the program, he could get the degree. He planed to get the degree so that he can teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So, what is the relationship between the person he have an affair with, Chai-yan Wang?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in the cram school. The cram school staff arranged one Chinese teacher partnering with a foreign teacher. Chai-yan Wang is the Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have some extramarital affairs?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	Initially, I noticed that he often stayed late in the cram school for working. I had asked him before because it was just a cram school to teach English. How can he work so late? He told me that because his partnered with a Chinese teacher, they had to discuss more in detail. In the beginning, I did not suspect of him. Later, he often got some phone calls after he came home. After getting the calls, he all went to the study room to talk and did not talk before me. This behavior made me suspect, so I checked his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Is there any doubtful clue in his cell phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his calling record, there is one number showing up very often. So, I checked his text messages with that number. After I checked text messages, I found that he sends messages with a woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Sending text messages is not a big deal. Is that very inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If this is a normal text message, that’s all. But he has got married with me, how can he send intimate messages with another woman? I have provided some details about these messages to the court, and these details may be included in the investigatory files.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please check page 13 on the investigatory file 1. These are the contents taken from those messages. Please check it. Were these contents from your messages?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是，這是從我的手機簡訊中取下來的。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now, the court will ask you some questions in terms of this content. The first is the message sent at 9:50 on November 31st, 2012, and the number is 0958-932XXX. The content is “我非常想念你.” What does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我一個同事發給我的。我記得那時候我請兩天假。她非常擔心。這才是為什麼她傳簡訊給我。我同事是在美國受教育的，她的思想十分開放。這就是她說話的方式。至於裡面說的愛，只是我們關懷他人的說法而已。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You said that the woman was educated in the United States, so her concept is more westernized. The expression about her emotion is more open-minded. So, the word “my love” does not have some other implications, does it?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	這只是好朋友間會講的，沒有什麼特別的意思。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the last sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	如前所說，她非常擔心我，我們是工作同事。我兩天沒到，她當然會掛念我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that the person sent this message to you because you had two day off at that time? Without your assistance in class, she was very missing you. Is that all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對，沒錯，這簡訊不是什麼大問題啊。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent at 11:55 p.m. on January 13th, 2013. The message is that “我想要妳陪我，我們什麼時候能在一起呢.” What does this sentence mean? Why is there such a message

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這個句子的原因是，要怎麼把這個句子寫成中文，這是我們作業的內容。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Did you mean that she sent you this message because she wanted to help you complete you assignment? What dose that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太跟庭上所說，我有英語教學的課程。在那個課堂中，我必須要取得30學分，才能擁有學位。當中我會有些作業和活動。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you explain the degree you were perusing?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程是英語教學。在那課程中，有英語教學課程，也有文化背景的相關教學。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you are pursuing the degree from the graduate school of TESOL, and in this program, there are some classes related to culture competence. Is that true?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	沒錯，我記的有3個是有關文化溝通的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	In this class, what were the assignments given within it?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	在文化溝通這堂課中，每個學生的作業都不同。拿我自身舉例。我想在台灣找個英語教學的職位。為了這個目標，我必須要有能力來證明我的中文能夠變通。所以在作業上，有許多中英翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that you wanted to teach in Taiwan. Therefore, in the courses of the program, you have to proof your Chinese competence. So, you have to finish the assignments arranged by the program so that you can prove your language competence. Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	沒錯，我也想增進我的聽力還有寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So, let us go back to the sentence. This sentence is your assignment. Is it true?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我記得這個句子。當我拿到一個英文句子時，我不知怎麼用中文講它。有些句子外國人很難說。我需要些幫忙，所以就找我同事。我問他怎麼翻譯這個句子，她就用簡訊回我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you asked the collogue to translate the sentence into Chinese and that she sent back with the English sentence. Is that true? That is to say, the sentence in the text message is that answer of your assignment. Is that right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	這個句子只是我作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now, please check page 14-16 on the investigatory file 1.Please check the content. Because you asked for help to complete your assignment, she sent these messages. Is that right?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯，這些簡訊都是為了要完成作業而傳的。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What’s your explanation in terms of your wife’s doubt you have an affair with Chai-yan, Wang?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我老婆想太多了。我知道他對我有固定收入這件事非常不滿意。告訴庭上，我的老婆在課程上並沒給予我任何協助。她根本沒有意願要幫我完成這個學位。如果她多幫我一點，我就不會像我同事求救啊。我覺得她應該為件事被譴責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you just said, you two are not very happy with each other.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在婚姻剛開始，我們真的過得很快樂。問題就在我的就業狀況。我想在台灣教葡萄牙語，但授課時數都不是很穩定。我的工作情況變成我們相處的問題。因

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to the program. When did you start participating in the program? Is that finished? Did you get your degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年剛開始時參與的。這是2年的課程。我應該在2012年12月完成的。但我沒辦法在這2年內完成學位，因為現在工作太忙了，沒辦法完成所有的作業。就像我剛說的，我的老婆根本不支持我。我覺得只能靠自己的力量來完成這個學位。我非常勞累、感到挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You just said that this program is a two-year program, and you had not finished it yet. What’s the reason?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法達成這些課程所有的需求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When was the last registration date? When did it end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一次註冊的時間是2012年的秋天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	According to what you just said, the program ended on December 5th, 2012. There is some duration between the dates you just said. So, at that time, you don’t have any assignments, right? However, after the program ended, you still got messages from the person for 6 months. Why?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	雖然我沒有完成那個課程，但就不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。雖然我沒有完成這個課程，但我還是想要增進我的中文能力，所以我就自學。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that although you fell to finish the program, you still want to enhance your Chinese language competence and want to speak fluent Chinese. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，所以我就請我同事幫忙我。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So, this co-worker served as the Chinese tutor for you. Is that right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，而是我真正的好朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，雖然我有要付她錢，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	Without your payment, why did still send you messages in the very late time when most people go to bed? Are these interaction beyond co-workers’ relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說這個朋友非常支持我。她用她自己的時間幫我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Did you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對，我還在那邊工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does this person still work there as well?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那家補習班上課，但我們現在沒有跟她搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there any need to subpoena another person in this case?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena the defendant’s colleague, Chai-yan, Wang, who is working in the Bo-Yuan cram school as the witness in this case. I would like to ask her to explain her relationship with the defendant and to elaborate the purposes of these text messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The plaintiff, is there any evidence which you hope the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that that cram school has taken some actions about the relationship between my husband and that party. One of the actions is that the cram school asked Chai-yan, Wang to quit her job. I want the cram school to proof and make more explanations for that.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, is there any evidence that you hope the court to investigate for you? Now, the situation is that your program had ended on December 5th, 2012. There is no reason to explain why you two send messages to each other after you fell the program, especially the time when you sent text messages and interacted with each other, because the time is too late. Do you have any evidence to explain for yourself?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我手邊沒有任何證據和資料來佐證。就像我說，我們兩個傳簡訊、互動的理由很簡單。我只是想增進我的語文能力，和繼續學中文而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	Then, the court will set the next court date at 4:30 p.m. on July 9th, 2014 for the inquiry procedure. The defendant, you have to attend the court. It is necessary that both of you can have a lawyer at that day. Do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Okay, the today’s court will end here.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	 Today we are here for preparatory procedure of adultery case.The defendant named Yu-Hua Chen filed this case.The main reason is that her husband has an intimate relationship with his co-worker in the cram school.The plantiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. In addition, her husband often has tele-conferencing with his co-worker, Cai-Ian Wang in the midnight, and he often stay up late…..The evidence that the plantiff found has beyond co-worker’s relationship. That is the reason why the plantiff filed this case.Defendant, what’s your plea about your wife charged you of adultery. 

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我無罪

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the main point is to question the defendant of the message with his co-worker.The purpose is to investigate whether these messages can constitute the adultery.Both parties, do you fully understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	 I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plantiff, how long have you married with your husband? Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	I have married with my husband for 4 years. We don’t have children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you marry with your husband in Taiwan? Or other countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	 We met each other in Taiwan, He taught Portuguese in Taiwan 4 years ago.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So he has taught Portuguese in Taiwan in the past years?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he still taught Portuguese.However, Portuguese is not so popular in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hours is not stable.Sometimes, he did not work for 1 or 2 months. Therefore, in order to have more income, he started to teach English.However, since his mother tongue is not English, he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You have mentioned he is going to seek an advanced degree, does it mean that he has to study for a degree in Taiwan….

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	NO.Because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, he has to get a degree for English teaching.He has found a distance learning program provided from California,Therefore, he can have a distance learning in Taiwan, rather than going to America.After he finished this distance program, he can get a degree.The reason he takes this distance learning program is that he can get a job of English teacher.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What is his relationship with the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in cram school.In that cram school, they are partners. One is Chinese teacher, and the other is English teacher. She is the Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know that they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	First, I only realized that my husband often work late in cram school.I have asked him the question that how come you have so many work to do in a English cram school?He told me that he has to partner with a Chinese teacher. They have many things to discuss with.At first, I really didn’t suspect him.However, I have found he usually picked up some phone calls after he got home.When he answered the phone, he would go to the study room instead of talking in front of me.That the reason why I started to suspect him and I checked his cellphone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Do you find any problem in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I often see the same phone number in his phone book.Therefore, I was so curious about it so I checked his text message.Then I found that he texts with a woman almost every day. 

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	It is just a message. Is something improper in the message?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	 If it is just a normal message, it’s okay.However, he is a married person. How can he let other text him with some intimate messages?I have provided some intimate messages for the court. It should be in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	As the file one, page.13.Defendant, please see the content of these messages. Are these messages taken from your cellphone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的,這是我手機上的訊息

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I am going to ask you some questions about these messages.The message is from the phone number 0958-932***. The date is 9:50 p.m., Nov.31st, 2012.The content is “我真的很想你,親愛的” what is this about?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我一個同事傳給我的我記得那時候,我休了兩天假他有點擔心我所以他才會傳這封信我的同事是在美國接受教育的,因此思想很開放這是他表達情感的方式至於”親愛的”,這是對我們所關心的人的一個統稱

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that the person who sent you this message has spent some time in western countries. Therefore, she is more open-minded.She is also open-minded in expressing her emotions?Therefore, the words ”my love” do not have much meaning, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	對阿 就只是好朋友間的稱呼

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the last sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我剛說的,我們是同事,他就只是擔心我當我不在兩天,他自然會想我啊

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean that it because that you took two days off, she sent you this message. Without your assistance, she misses you. Is that all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對阿 就這樣啊 這訊息又沒什麼

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message is sent at 11:55 p.m. Jan.13th, 2013, and is from the same phone number.The content is that”我希望你在我身邊,什麼時候能成真呢?”Then what does this mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他寫這封信只是想告訴我怎麼寫作業

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she sent you this message to help you do your homework? How?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太說的,我有參加遠距教學課程我需要修習30學分,才能得到學位所以我當然需要完成一些作業

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Please explain that what did you learn from this program?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程是關於英語教學 課程內容有分幾個部分, 有英語教學,文化及語言能力等等

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you get a degree in TESOL, but there are some courses about culture communication, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對阿 我記得至少有三堂課是關於文化溝通

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What is the assignment from the culture and communication course?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	針對每個不同的學生,會有不同的作業就我而言我在台灣,並且想得到一份英語教學的工作為了達到這個目標,我必須證明我有足夠的中文能力因此,我有很多關於英中句子翻譯的作業

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove that you have certain language competence in Chinese, right?So you have to finish some assignments in this course, and they are English-to-Chinese translation of sentences? Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是阿 就是這樣啊 我另外也需要加強我的口說和寫作技巧

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s go back to the last sentence. You said that it’s your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對阿 我還記得這句子當我拿到這個中文句子時,我不知道怎麼翻譯你也知道吧, 有些中文字對外國人來說很難記得我需要一些幫助阿 所以我找我同事我請他幫我翻譯,然後再傳給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Your co-worker translated this sentence into English and sent to you, right?That is to say, the content of this message is just the answer of my homework.

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	是的 就只是我作業的解答

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now please see the file one, page.14-16.Please see these contents.  Are these messages all about your assignment?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對的 所有簡訊都是關於作業上的問題

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What is your explanation about your wife charged you of having an affair with Cai-Ian Wang?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了我知道他對我對於這個家的付出感到不滿我希望庭上知道,打從一開始,他就不支持我修這課程他不願意幫助我完成這份課程如果他願意幫我的話,我就不用問我同事拉 因此 我認為他要為這些誤會負責 

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you said, there seems to be some disagreements between you and your wife? 

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在剛結婚的時候,我們的確相處得不錯  但問題就出在我的工作我試著在台灣教葡萄牙文,但卻沒有穩定的工作時數因此我的工作成了我們之間的大問題我們常為了這件事爭吵他不相信我真的已經盡力了我不知道要怎樣讓他了解我的困難和挫折

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s talk about the aforementioned courses.When did it start? Did you get your degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	 我的課程是在2010年春天開始 這是兩年的課程我應該是要在2012年12月完成我並沒有完成這課程,因為我在做兼職的工作,沒有足夠的時間完成作業就像我說的,我太太並不支持我做這件事我覺得我只有一個人在努力得到這學位我覺得很累而且很挫折

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	This is a two-year program. Why did you fail to finish it?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法達到所有課程的要求

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When did your last semester end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	最後一學期是2012年秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	According to what you said, after Dec.5, 2012. You have no more assignments after then, right?Then how come you still contact with your co-worker…….

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我雖然沒辦法完成課程,但這並不代表我不想增進我的語言能力 即使我拿不到學位,我還是很努力地想靠自己增進我的中文能力

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So even if you failed the program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對 這就是為什麼我尋求同事的幫助

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So this co-worker just plays a role like your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不只是我的家教,更是我的好朋友 

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Do you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	我想付他錢,但她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	Why she answered you in the midnight even if you didn’t pay her?Is this behavior beyond co-worker’s relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我才說他是個很支持我的朋友阿他不惜犧牲自己的時間幫助我學中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still wok in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對阿 我還在那教英文

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is Cai-Ian Wang still working there, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	他還在那工作啊,只是我們不是搭檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you want to subpoena any witness or to investigate any other evidence?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	 I hope to subpoena Cai-Ian Wang who works in Bo-Yuan cram school as a witness. I want her to explain the relationship between her and the defendant. Also, the details of the messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plantiff, do you have any other evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has taken some actions about their relationship.Among that, I heard that the cram school has persuaded Cai-Ian Wang to quit the job. I wonder whether I can ask the cram school for this.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you?The situation is that your program has finished on Dec.5th, 2012.You have no reason to text message with Cai-Ian Wang Especially that you two also text message to each other after 9:00 p.m.Do you have any evidence to help you with this case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到任何可以請庭上為我調查的證據就像我說的,我們之間傳簡訊的原因是很單純的我真的只是想要增強我的語言能力並學中文

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court for questioning of witness is set at 4:30 p.m. June 9th, 2014.Plantiff and Defendant, you have to show up. If necessary, both parties have right to a lawyer.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Okay, today’s procedure is over.

zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of adultery. The plaintiff Yu Hua Chen file this case. It is because his husband has something with his co-worker. The plaintiff has found some intimate messages in his cell phone. In addition, the plaintiff’s husband will find reasons for working late or tele-conferences with his co-worker Cai Yan Wang. The messages that the plaintiff has collected has been beyond the co-workers’ relationship. As a result, she files this case. The defendant, your wife suspects you of adultery, what’s your pleat?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我無罪答辯

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the purpose is to ask the messages between the defendant and his co-worker. The purpose is to prove if the defendant commits the crime of adultery with his co-worker. Do you understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	The plaintiff, how many years have you been married with your husband? Do you have any child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years and we do not have children. 

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Are you married in Taiwan or broad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I meet with my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the past years, did he also teach Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued to teach Portuguese. However, because the Portuguese is not so common language that people learn in Taiwan, so his teaching hours are not so fixed. Sometimes the period between jobs will be two months. Then he hoped he can get the fixed income, so he started to teach English. However, because his mother language is not English, he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree, is he want to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Because he hoped to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he achieved has to be English teaching. He found a distant learning program which is provided by the California in America on the Internet. He can complete his courses with the distant learning without going to the America. In this way, he can achieve the doctor degree. He planned to achieve American degree to find the English teaching job in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what is his relationship between the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in the cram school. In that cram school, they have arranged the teachers to partner with each other. And the person is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know they have adultery?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	In the beginning, I just found that my husband will always work late in school. I asked it is just an cram school, why do you work so late? He told that he had to partner with the Chinese teacher, and there are so many things to discuss. In the beginning, I didn’t doubt him. However, I found that he will get some phone calls after work. After he got the phone call, he will not talk in front of me; instead, he will go to the study room. I started to doubt him, so I checked his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So what did you see in his cell phone that is innormal

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone call history, there is a fixed number. So I was curious that I checked his messages. After checking, he has sent a message to a woman almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Is there any wrong to send message? Is it because the message is not so appropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If the message is so ordinary, then it will be fine. But he was a person who got married, how can he send the intimate messages? I provided the message contents to the court. I think they are all in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please check the page 13 on the file 1. The defendant, there are some message contents, please check this. Are these messages the contents in your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	沒錯

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I want to ask you some questions according to these contents. The first message is sent in the number of 0958932… at 9:50 pm November 31st 2012. The content is “I really miss you, my love” What’s the meaning?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	嗯…那是我同是寄的啊！我記得那時候我請了2天的假。她感到有點擔心。這就是為甚麼她寄給我這種簡訊。我同事在美國讀過書，所以她非常的開放。那就是她說話的方式啊！為甚麼她說”love”這個字呢? 這就是我們稱呼彼此的方法啊！

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that the message sender because he once studied in America so she is open minded? And she is also open minded in emotion expression, so the word “my love” do not have any special meaning?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	沒有啊，在朋友之間這是非常平常的表達方法

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the sentence she mentioned?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的啊，她非常擔心我，我們是工作上的夥伴啊！當我請了2天假，她非常想念我啊！

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean because you took two days off so the woman sends this message to you? Without your assistance, so she missed you? Is that…?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊，這就是內容啊！那簡訊根本就沒什麼

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	OK, and the second message is sent in the same number at 11:55 pm January 13th 2013. The content is “I want you by my side, when can we be together?” So what does this message mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	null

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean the woman sent you the message just to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太跟庭上說的啊，我正在上碩士的課。在這個課程，我必須修滿30學分我才能得到學位。而我也需要完成一些作業和練習。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain that what is your major in your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的主要課程是英語教學。在那個課程中，有些是有關英語教學的，有些則是有關文化和語言能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So what you learn is English teaching, but there are some cultural courses in this program?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得至少三門課是跟文化和溝通有關。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what’s the assignment that this course will require?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這文化溝通課程的作業會依每個學生而不一樣。以我自己為例，我來台灣是為了想要找到教學的工作，為了達成這個目標並表達我有足夠的能力，我必須擁有足夠的中文。所以很多作業都是有關中英翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean you want to teach Chinese in Taiwan, so in this program of master degree you have to prove your have competence of Chinese. And you have to finish assignment in this course, and some of the assignment is about English and Chinese translation?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	沒錯，而且我還被要求要訓練我的口說和寫作能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s move back to the message we mentioned before. Is that your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是啊，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這個中文句子，我不知道要怎麼翻譯。你也知道有些中文字對外國人來說非常難。我需要一些幫助，所以我就請我的同事幫忙。我請她幫我翻譯這個句子然後再傳簡訊給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean you sent the Chinese sentence to your co-worker and she translated it into English and sent back to you, is that right? So the message is the answer to your assignment?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，這封簡訊只是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now let’s take a look at page 14-16 on file 1. Please take a look at it. Are all those messages sent by your co-worker just because you want to do your homework?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是啊，這些簡訊全都是為了要完成我的作業才傳的

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	And what’s your explanation about that your wife suspected you have adultery with your co-worker Cai Yan Wang?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得我太太想太多了。我知道她對我無法扶養這個家庭感到不滿意。我希望法庭知道我開始上課時我太太都不支持我。她不願意幫助我得到這個學位。如果她能多一點支持我的話，我就不會請我同事幫忙了。我覺得她該為這個誤會負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you said, it seems that you do not interact with your wife so happily?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	剛結婚時我們關係還算好。但問題就是我的工作問題。我想要在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是工作時數一直不穩定。所以工作問題就變成我們2個之間關係的問題了。我們常常為了這個問題吵架，她不相信我已經盡力了，我也無法讓她了解我是多麼的無力還有我面臨的…

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	OK, let’s move back to the master program you mentioned. When did your master degree program started? Did you finish it? Did you get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	這個碩士課程從2010年春季開始。它是2年的課程。這個課程應該在12月22日就完成了。我沒有完成這個課程因為我有兼一些工作，所以沒時間做功課。就像我說的，我太太都不支持我，我覺得我都是孤軍奮鬥在完成那個課程的。我覺得非常疲累也非常無力。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean the program is two-year but you didn’t finish it, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成所有課程的要求

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When your registered semester end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一個註冊學期是2012年…

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So according to what you said, that your program will end on December 5th 2012, then after that you won’t have any assignment. However, after your program ended, the message between you and your co-worker is still keep going, then why?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒完成那個學位並不代表我不想再增進我的語言能力。雖然課程結束了，但是我還是想要學中文

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that although you failed your master degree program, you still want to improve your Chinese competence, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	沒錯，這就是為甚麼我要請我的同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the role your co-worker plays is a little like your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是家教，她也是我真正的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Do you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	我有說要付錢給她，但她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why she bothered to send you the message to help you to learn Chinese in the mid-night? Is this behavior just beyond the co-worker’s behavior?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，她是非常支持我的朋友，她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是的，我還在那邊工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So the co-worker Cai Yan Wang is also working there now?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她還在那邊工作啊，但我們不再是一起教書的夥伴了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any evidence or witness that you want to subpoena? 

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena the defendant’s co-worker, which is Cai Wan Wang, working in the Bo Yuan cram school. I hope her to explain the relationship between the defendant and her and the purpose of those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The plaintiff, do you have any evidence that you want to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has take some action about the relationship between my husband and his co-worker. And they tried to persuade to quit the job. I hope that the court can confirm this from the cram school.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence you hope the court to investigate? Now the situation is that your master program has finished on December 5th 2012. There is no reason you send the message between you and your co-worker just to finish your assignment. Especially that the messages between your co-worker and you are after 9 pm, it’s a little suspectful. Do you have any evidence that will help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我目前想不到任何證據可以請法院幫我調查的。就像我說的，我跟我同事對話目的都沒什麼。我只是想要增進我的語言能力和學中文

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So the cross-questioning procedure will be set at 4:30 pm June 9th 2014. The plaintiff and the defendant, you have to attend the court on that day. If necessary, you can have your lawyer, do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	So the court dismiss here today.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我知道了

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we’re here to day for the adultery case. The plaintiff Yu-Hua Chen filed the case. Because her husband John Anderson has developed intimate encounter with his colleague in cram school. The plaintiff has discovered some intimate message in her husband’s cell phone. Also, the plaintiff’s husband constantly make up reasons for extending his shift and have tele-conferencing with his co-worker 王彩燕. The evidence gathered by the plaintiff has shown that her husband and 王彩華has go beyond co-worker’s relationship, therefore consisted this lawsuit. Defendant, you wife suspects that you’re having an affair, what do you say about that?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然無罪啊

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, we’re going to look into the details of the communication record of the defendant and his co-worker. The purpose of this is to know whether if they’re having an affair and if it really constitutes an adultery case. Do both parties understand the procedure.

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是  我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, I want to ask the plaintiff, how long have you and your husband been married? 

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years and we have no children. 

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or outside Taiwan?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met in Taiwan. Four years ago when he first came to Taiwan, he came to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in the pass few years, has he been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	He was a Portuguese Teacher when we first met. And after we got married, he still teaches Portuguese. But Portuguese is not that much a popular language, so his working hours are unstable. Sometimes there are even periods between jobs in months. In this sense, he wanted to have a more stable job, so he started teaching English. As English is not his mother tongue, he decided to seek an advance degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You said about seeking a more advance degree. Do you mean he intended to study in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	He wants to teach in Taiwan, so the degree he’s seeking must be related to TESOL. He found a distance learning program of the University of California on the internet. So he doesn’t have to be in the States to get the degree, instead he could get the degree by distant learning. So he can manage to get the degree after he finished all the credits. His plan is that to get the degree licensed by the United states, he could get an English teaching job here in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what exactly is the relationship between your husband and his mistress in this case?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They’re partners and co-workers in cram school. So in the cram school, they have a policy to partner the foreign teacher with the local teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	Then you do you know they’re having an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, the only thing I found was that my husband was lengthening his shift. I asked him isn’t it just a cram school, what’s there to be lengthening your working hours? What he told me was that, since he has to partner with the local teacher therefore he needs more time to practice. I did not doubt him at first. Then after a while, he had been picking up phone calls after his work shifts. And after he picked up the phone, he wouldn’t talk in frond of me, instead he talked in the study room. This made me very suspicious, so I checked his phonebook. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything unusual in his phonebook?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I found a constantly dialed number. Being very curious, I also checked his text message. And this was when I discovered that he was contacting this mistress.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Well, after all it’s just text message, is there anything that’s inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it was just very simple text message, I wouldn’t go for it. But he’s a married man, how could he let a woman send him some intimate messages? I have provided some evidence for the court, I think they are in the case files.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please see the evidence file 1. Here are several text message content, defendant please take a look. Are these text messages sent from your phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對 這確實是我手機裡的手機內容

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	I’m going to ask you a few questions based on these text messages. The first text message was sent at nine fifty PM on the 31st of November 2013 from the cellphone 0958-932***. The content was內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這只是我同事傳給我的啦, 我記得那時候我剛好修了兩天假, 他大概有點擔心吧所以他才傳這封簡訊, 我的同事是在美國接受教育地所以他的思想非常開放, 那就是他表達的方式啊, 至於說 噢 我的愛  那只是對關心的人表達的一種方式

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean your colleague is more westernized because she studied in the United States. And she’s more open minded in terms of emotions.So the content my love doesn’t have any special meaning right? 

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	當然不是啊, 這在好朋友和老朋友之間是很正常的表達方式

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about her previous sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	如我所說, 她只是擔心我而已, 我們就是工作的同事/夥伴, 當我請了兩天假, 她很自然而然的想念我

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean she sent you this text message just because you didn’t come to work for two days? Without your assistance she missed you? Is that it? 

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊  最主要就是這樣, 這封簡訊的內容就單純只是這樣而已

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	So the second text message was sent at 23:55, 13th of January 2013 from the same cellphone 0958, is that right? 內容是我真的好想你, 希望你真的能陪在我身邊, What do you mean by that? Can you elaborate?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她這麼發訊息只是告訴我我的中文作業理該怎麼表達

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You’re saying that she sent you this message so as to help you huh?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	當我太太像法院提出告訴, 我正在休息我的碩士學位, 要取得那個學位我必須先完成30個學分, 我自然而然需要完成一些作業和課業

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain what exactly are you studying in your master profra

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的學位是英語教學碩士學位, 這學位的內容有部分是英語教學, 那其他部分還包含文化課程和語言能力

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you’re getting a degree in TESOL, and there are cross cultural communication courses in this program right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對 我記得至少有三門課是跟文化還有溝通有關

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what kind of assignments do they give you in the cultural communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	文化溝通的作業會因學生而異, 就我自己來舉例, 我在台灣試圖尋求英語教學的工作機會, 為了達到這個目標, 我必須證明我有中文能力, 所以我的一些作業內容就會包含中英翻譯

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean because you’re planning to teach in Taiwan so you have to show that you have some Chinese competence right? As a result you have to complete some Chinese courses, and in these courses, there are Chinese-english translation right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	當然, 我也被要求要加強我的口說和寫作能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Ok, back to the beginning, this is your assignment right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對 我記得這個句子, 當我得到這個句子時 我並不知道他的英文怎麼說, 妳也知道有些中文字對外國人來說真的非常難以辨認, 我需要一些協助所以才跟我同是協助, 我叫他幫我翻譯這個句子然後再用訊息傳給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean because you asked your colleague about the sentence in Chinese so that’s why she sent it to you in English? So the message was simply an answer for the assignment right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對  那只是作業的答案

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	So now, we’ll see page 14 and 16 in the invest gory file, please check the content. So the colleague sent you these messages because you have problem finishing your assignments.

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對  所有訊息的目的都一樣是幫助我完成功課

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So upon your wife’s lawsuit against your colleague 王彩文 what do you say about that?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得我太太真的想太多了, 我知道她對於我負擔家計的能力感到不滿足, 我希望庭上能了解她對我的學習從來沒有任何支持, 她根本不想幫助我完成我的學業, 她如果能支持我我根本不會找我的同事來幫助我我覺得這些誤會應該怪我太太

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, there seems to be some quarrels between you and your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們新婚的時候我們確實有一些美好時光, 但工作就是一個大問題, 我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文但我的時數不夠, 所以工作就變成我們爭吵的課題我們三不五時就為這吵架, 她不認為我有努力的付出, 所以她完成無法了解我辛苦的付出

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Ok, back to the master program we talked about. When did you start your master program? Did you get the degree and are you done with it?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始這個課程, 這是兩年的課程, 我原本應該在2012年的12月完成學位, 可是因為工作忙碌的關係, 我並沒有足夠的時間來完成學位要求的一些作業, 就像我說的我太太一直都不支持我, 我覺得我好像自己一個人在為這個學位努力, 我既疲累又身心俱疲.

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So the duration of this program is two years, but you didn’t finish it, why? 

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法達成學位所有要求的課程

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	So when was the last registration of this semester?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you said about the last registration, it ends on the fifth of December 2012, so after that, you shouldn’t have anything to do with the program right? But the text message between you and your colleague continued six months after your program, and why’s that?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	就算我沒有拿到學位, 我也想增進我的中文能力啊, 就算沒拿到學位我也想增進我的中文能力, 所以我精益求精的學中文

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean even if you didn’t get the degree, you still want to continue to practice your Chinese, is that true?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對  所以我才求助於我的同事

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleague is like your tutor huh?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是個家教而已, 她是個真正的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	不, 我想要付她錢, 但她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	So if you didn’t pay her, why did she continue to send you these text messages even in sleeping hours? Don’t you think that your relationship was beyond coworkers?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	如我所說她是非常挺我的朋友, 她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach in the same cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對, 我還在那工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	And your colleague王彩燕, does she still work in the same cram school?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那裏工作, 但我們已經不一起搭檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Is there any other evidence or witness? Prosecutor?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena the defendant’s colleague to the court to witness for this case. So she can clarify about her relationship with the defendant and her purpose of sending those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Is there any other evidence that the plaintiff wish the court to investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school took actions for the relationship of my husband and 王彩燕. The cram school even tried to persuade 王彩燕 to quit the job. Is it possible to ask the cram school whether this is true or not?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence that could help you?Well, the point is your master program should have end on the 5th of December 2012. There’s no reason to keep contact with 王彩燕 because of the assignment right? Especially, you two usually send text message after 9 PM and that’s a little bit weird. Do you have any evidence that could help you?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我不認為庭上有任何能幫助我的證據, 如我所說, 我和我同事連絡的目的非常簡單, 只是想提升我的語言能力繼續進修中文

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	Ok, we will have our witness on the ninth of June 2014 for the witness procedure. Plaintiff and defendant, both of you have to show up on that date. If necessary, you can hire an attorney, do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Ok, we dismiss the court.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure of adultery case, case number 2887.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The plaintiff, Ms. 陳玉華 filed the case. The reason is that her husband John Anderson has intimate relationship with his colleague. Besides, the plaintiff found that there are some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. Plus, the defendant has often made up reasons for working overtime or chatting with his colleague, Ms. 王彩燕, in the middle of the night via tele-conferencing or other ways. The contents of the messages collected by the plaintiff are considered beyond co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, simply speaking, your wife doubts that you have an affair and accused you of adultery. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯，當然。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the major purpose is to ask about the details of phone records between the defendant and his colleague.The purpose is to clarity whether the defendant truly has an affair with his colleague and constitute adultery. Do both parties understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, I will ask the plaintiff some questions. How long have you been married to your husband? Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years, and we don't have children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you marry your husband abroad or in Taiwan?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and mainly wanted to teach Portuguese. 

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	For past few years, is hid job here to teach Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he had kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hours were unstable. Sometimes, there would be a period of one or two months between two teaching courses. Later on, to make his income more stable, he wanted to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean that he would like to pursue a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to receive a degree of TESOL. He found a distance learning program offered by California in the United States online. Therefore, he could complete the course requirements by the means of online learning without going to the United States in person. After receiving all the credits, he could receive a master degree. His plan is that with such a degree offered by the United States, he can find a position as an English teacher in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What is the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	The cram school partner a foreign teacher with a Chinese teacher for teaching, and that woman is his teaching partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know your husband has an affair with his colleague?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At the beginning, I just noticed that my husband often worked overtime at the cram school. I have asked him several times. Why does he have to work overtime at a cram school? He told me that because he had to partner with a Chinese teacher for teaching, many details have to be discussed. 一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，I truly had no doubts on his saying at first. However, I later found out that after he arrived home, he frequently received calls. In addition, he never answered the calls in front of me. Instead, he would go to the study room to talk on the phone. That made me suspect him, so I checked his cellphone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Do you find anything unusual in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I often saw a certain set of numbers in the records of his phone book, so I checked his messages out of curiosity. Then I found that he has texted with a woman almost every single day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Is it actually all right with texting messages, right? Is the content very inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If they are common messages, it is fine. However, he is married. How could that woman always send him some intimate sentences? Earlier on, I have provided the court with some contents of their messages. They should be in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please show the file one, page 13. There are some contents of several messages. The defendant, please verify whether the messages are from your cellphone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這些是我手機裡的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	 I have some questions for you based on these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50 at night on November 31st in 2012 from the number 0958932 and so on. The content said that “I really miss you, my love.”What does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這的確是我同事傳的簡訊。她只是關心我、擔心我，所以發簡訊給我。我同事在美國受教育的，她思想很西化，這就是她說話、表達情感的方式。至於「我的愛」一詞，這只是對我們關心的人的稱呼而已。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You said that the sender was educated abroad, so her thoughts are quite westernised, and the way she expresses herself is more open, so the word “my love”does not carry any special meaning, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	對，這只是一種普遍稱呼好朋友和關心的人的方式而已。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	And the sentence in front?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	像我說的，她只是關心我，我們是工作夥伴。當我休假兩天的時候，她當然會想我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because you were off for two days, she sent you such a message, and because without your assistance in the courses, she missed you so much? Is that it?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	這就是簡訊內容，並沒有什麼特別的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	And the second message was sent at 11:55 at night on January 13th, 2013 via the same phone number. The content was that “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?”What does that mean? Why did the sender text you such a message?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她只是告訴我作業中的一句中文怎麼寫而已。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Do you mean that she sent you this message only for helping you complete your assignment? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	像我太太剛剛告訴法院的，我在修一個碩士課程。課程中，我必須完成三十個學分才能拿到學位。我當然必須完成一些作業和習題。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	 Could you elaborate    what you exactly study for your master’s degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我修的是英語教學，有些課和英語教學有關，有些跟文化和語言能力有關。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you study a master program on TESOL, and some courses are related to culture communications, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三門課和文化溝通有關

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What kind of assignments were be given by such courses of culture and communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這些文化溝通課程的作業因學生而異。以我自己為例。我住在台灣，想要找到教英文的工作。為了達成這個目標，並精進語文能力，我必須有好的中文能力。因此，我有很多作業跟中英翻譯有關。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because you planned to teach English in Taiwan, this program requires you to prove you have a certain level of Chinese ability? And therefore, you have to complete some assignments give by the courses, which is sentence translation? Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對的，我當然必須精進我的口說和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	All right, let’s go back to that sentence. You said that was your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，我記得這個句子。我剛開始不知道那些中文句子用英文該怎麼說。有些中文字對外國人來說很難認。我需要一些協助，所以請同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯句子，用簡訊傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you asked your colleague how to say that sentence in Chinese, and she texted you the answer? Is that the scenario? In other words, the content of the message is only the answer to the assignment, right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	簡訊內容就是我的作業答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Then please show the contents of all the messages on page 14 to page 16 in the file one. Please verify the messages. Is it because that you has to do your assignments and ask for help from your colleague, asking her to send you messages?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，所有簡訊都是為了幫助我完成作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Your wife just said that you have an affair with your colleague, 王彩燕, what is your explanation? 

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了！我想她只是不滿意我賺錢的能力。我想告訴庭上，我太太從一開始就完全不支持我念碩士，她並不願意幫助我完成學業。如果她願意支持我一點點，我不會請同事幫忙。我覺得她自己應該為這誤解負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your saying, there are some unpleasant situations between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	剛結婚的時候，我們的確渡過了一段美好時光，但是問題出在我的工作。我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是授課時數很不穩定，所以我的工作就成了我們之間的問題。我們常常為這個問題吵架。她不相信我已經盡力了，我也無法讓她理解我遇到的挫折和困難。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Well, let’s go back to the master program, which you just talked about. When did you start your program, and does it end? Did you receive the degree? 

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我的碩士課程從2010年春天開始，是兩年的課程，應該要在2012年12月完成課程。但是我沒有完成課程，因為我有兼差，沒有時間完成我的課程作業。像我說的，我太太並不支持我。我覺得是自己一路單獨奮鬥，感覺很累、很有挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	Do you mean that the program should have lasted for two years, but you did not complete it, and why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成所有的課程要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	What did it end, the last semester that you registered? 

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是在2012年秋季。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If as you said, your last semester ended on December 5th in 2012, based on reasonable doubts, you would have no assignments after that, right? How would you continue sending messages with your colleagues even until six months after the program was ended?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我也許無法完成課程，但不代表我不想精進語言能力。即使我不能完成課程，我還是很想加強我的中文能力，所以我繼續自我學習。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that even though  you failed to complete the master program, you still want to sharpen your Chinese ability and make your Chinese more fluent, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	是，我請同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So that colleague plays a role as a tutor, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不僅是個家教，也是我真正的好友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Have you offered her any pay?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我想要付她錢，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you had not paid her, why would she like to send you messages to answer your questions even in the middle of the night, when she should go to bed for sleep?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	因此我認為她是非常支持我的，她用自己的時間幫助我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still work as an English teacher at that cram school now?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是的，我還在那裡工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is that colleague, 王彩燕, still working there, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那裡工作，但我們不再是工作夥伴了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any further evidence to be investigated or people to be subpoenaed? 

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	We would like to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, 王彩燕, as a witness to the court to elaborate her relationship with the defendant and the background as well as the purpose of writing these messages?

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The plaintiff, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I have heard that the cram school has taken some actions because of their relationship. The cram school even tried to persuade Ms. 王彩燕 to leave the job position. I am wandering whether we can verify these facts with the cram school.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? The current situation is that your master program was ended on December 5th, 2012, and there are no reasons for you to take completing assignments as an excuse to explain the interaction of texting messages between you and 王彩燕, especially your interactions were mostly after 9 o’clock at night. This behaviour causes doubts. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我無法想到有任何證據是法院可以代表我調查的。如我所說，我和同事間的溝通很簡單。我只是想要精進中文能力，繼續學習中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court date is set at 4:30 in the afternoon on June 9th, 2014 for asking the witness. The plaintiff and the defendant, please do  come on that day. If necessary, the both parties have the right to hire lawyers. Do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	 I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Today’s court ends here.

zh-TW	今為偵字1415號 妨害名譽案件之準備程序
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of defamation, case number 1415

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院1415號 妨害名譽案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國109年7月22日。」

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	I’m going to inform your right and your obligation.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	You have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權雇用法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民或其他符合法律規定者，得請求法律服務。
en-US	You have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low-income family, a medium-and-low income family, or if you are an aborigine or meet other qualification set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	You have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence favorable to your case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your right

en-US	Yes, I do.
zh-TW	是的，我了解。

zh-TW	請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
en-US	The prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	As stated in the indictment.

zh-TW	被告因妨害名譽案件被檢察官起訴，起因是被告涉嫌在中華民國108年12月1日到109年1月20日之間，在網際網路論壇，名為Foreign Land (外國園地)，發表一連串的評論，雖此論壇之主要目的是提供在台居留外國人士交流之平台，但被告卻利用這樣一個平台進行對告訴人公司之批評，致使告訴人公司名譽受損。對此妨害名譽之告訴，有何辯解？
en-US	This incident happened on December 1, 2019 to January 20, 2020. The accused post the comments on the internet chat forum, Foreign Land, which provides foreigners in Taiwan to communicate with others. However, the accused used this platform to criticize the accuser’s company, which damaged the accuser’s company reputation, so the accused was prosecuted. What’s your plea?

en-US	I plead not guilty.
zh-TW	我沒有罪。

zh-TW	請問你知道「外國園地」這個論壇嗎？
en-US	The defendant, do you know the Internet forum, Foreign Land

en-US	Yes, Foreign Land is a forum very popular among foreigners.
zh-TW	我知道這個Foreign Land非常受歡迎，尤其是在外國人當中。

zh-TW	可以簡要的描述你在這個平台上的活動嗎？
en-US	Can you summarize your activities on Foreign Land?

en-US	I am a registered member, which means I can read others’ posts and post articles for others to read.
zh-TW	我是有註冊的會員，我可以看到別人發表的文章，同時也可以發表自己的文章給別人看。

zh-TW	你常常在上面發表文章嗎，可以大概抓個頻率嗎，大概多久發表一篇文章？
en-US	How often you post comments on the Foreign Land? ...

en-US	I won’t say I regularly post articles on Foreign Land. I only have postings when I want to share some concerns or vent my feelings. 
zh-TW	我不會說我常常在上面發文，我只有在我有一些疑慮，還有想要發洩一些情緒的時候才會在上面發文。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)65頁。這一頁是取自中華民國108年12月13日在「外國園地」中發表的內容。請你看一下，這是你寫的嗎？
en-US	… The page is about your comments on Foreign Land on December 13, 2019. Please take a look. Are these your posts?

en-US	It seems to be my posting but it was posted some time ago, I am not sure if the article is in its entirety.
zh-TW	我有發表這個文章，但是是在很久之前發表的，所以我不確定文章的完整性。

zh-TW	你在文中所提到的主要內容為何？請陳述。
en-US	Please describe the main content

en-US	As you can see from the copy, I posted some concerns and questions regarding Winwin company, especially about how foreigners were treated by that company.
zh-TW	…我在上面發表了我的疑慮、對公司的一些問題，還有他們怎麼對待外國員工。

zh-TW	你剛剛講到的某一公司，請問有在任何一篇文章當中，明確指出該公司的全名嗎？
en-US	You mentioned the full name of the company. Did you point out its name in any comments?

en-US	Yes, I am sure I have used the company’s full name, Winwin.
zh-TW	我確定我有在上面用公司的全名，贏贏。

zh-TW	你在65頁的內容中，提到該公司常常在雇用外國人時，沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利，更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況。請問，你這樣講，有證據嗎？
en-US	In Page 65, you mentioned this company hired foreign employee without following Labor Basic Law about work time, basic wage and benefits. The company didn’t help foreigners apply for working visa. For this, do you have any evidence?

en-US	I did mention those issues. I did not have evidence. I heard those issues from some other foreign friends who either worked for that company or had experiences with that company. As a result, I expressed my concerns in the question format, meaning I asked all those questions regarding working hours, basic salary, benefits and ARC application with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions.
zh-TW	我有講過這個問題，但我沒有證據。我是從我一些在那個公司工作的朋友或是在那邊有經驗的朋友聽來的。我有在論壇發表一些問題，包含了工作時數、基本薪資、福利，還有是否幫員工申請居留簽證…。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你是從其他外國朋友那邊聽到這些細節，但不是本人的第一手資料，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that you heard from you friends, but it isn’t your first-hand information, right?

en-US	True. I heard those details from other friends, also the registered members of Foreign Land.
zh-TW	沒錯，我是從朋友還有一些註冊會員那邊聽到這些小細節的。

zh-TW	那你怎麼可以在一個公開的論壇中，直接把聽來的東西，就做了轉述呢？
en-US	How could you repost this information on Foreign Land?

en-US	I didn’t quote others and post the concerns as accusations. Instead, all my comments were questions. I was hoping Winwin would provide some sort of clarifications so that the foreign community would not hold any wrong ideas against that company.
zh-TW	我沒有直接引用，我只是發表言論、提出我的問題。我只是希望贏贏公司可以釐清這些問題，讓外國人不會對這家公司有誤解。

zh-TW	什麼叫做你都是用問題的方式來進行批評？可以解釋一下嗎？
en-US	What do you mean that you criticize in questions? Can you explain it?

en-US	For example, I asked in one posting “Is it true that Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC, the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally?”. 
zh-TW	舉例來說，我發表了一個問題，就是那個公司有沒有幫外國人申請居留證，外國人可以合法居留嗎?

zh-TW	所以你發表這一系列文章的目的只是為了釐清所謂的「真相」，是嗎？
en-US	So, you posted a series of comments just in order to find out the truth?

en-US	Yes, I only wanted to get some clarifications or explanations. However, instead of responding to my questions directly, Winwin chose to file this lawsuit against me.
zh-TW	是的，我只是想要得到一些澄清和解釋。然而，這個公司沒有直接回答我的問題，而是對我提出告訴。

zh-TW	雖然告訴人有提供他們自外國園地抓下來文章內容，但他們也告訴檢方，這些內容並不完整。所以就你記憶所及，你大概連續發表了幾篇呢？
en-US	Although the accuser provided some comments from Foreign Land and told the police, but the content wasn’t entire. …

en-US	As I stated before, it has been some time already. I cannot recall exactly how many articles I posted on Foreign Land, perhaps eight to ten? The problem is when this lawsuit began, the administrator of Foreign Land decided to delete my postings to avoid trouble. 
zh-TW	我之前說過的，那些文章已經發表一段時間了，所以我不能明確告訴你我發了多少文章到論壇，也許是8到10篇。問題是當他們提出告訴後，版主就把我的文章全部刪除，以免造成麻煩。

zh-TW	你的意思是說當這個訴訟開始進行的時候，那個論壇的版主就進行了刪文的動作嗎？
en-US	You mean when the lawsuit began, the administrator of the forum deleted all of your posts, right?

en-US	Yes, that is correct.
zh-TW	是這樣沒錯。

zh-TW	也就是說，你完全沒有辦法確定你一共為此事件發表過幾篇文章？
en-US	That is, you can’t assure how many comments you posted, right?

en-US	That’s correct, too.
zh-TW	這樣也沒錯。

zh-TW	那就你記憶所及，你曾經接到過該公司任何希望你停止批評他們的要求嗎？你有照做嗎？
en-US	Did you remember that the company asked you to stop criticizing? Did you stop posting comments?

en-US	I think towards the end of my postings, I did get a request from Winwin, asking me to stop posting articles about their company. I didn’t stop immediately because, again, I was only asking questions.
zh-TW	我認為如果要我停止發文的話，我應該會收到一些叫我停止發文的請求，我沒有立即停止，因為就像我前面所說的，我只是問問題而已。

zh-TW	所以你還是堅持，因為你都是用問題的方式來發表評論，並沒有直接毀謗該公司名譽的事實，是嗎？
en-US	So, you mean you insist on posting comments in question, but not libeling the company, right?

en-US	It was never my intention to defame Winwin. I don’t quite understand how a series of questions could possibly constitute “defamation.”
zh-TW	我從來都不是故意要毀謗這個公司，我不懂為什麼問問題會造成毀謗。

zh-TW	那請問告訴人，貴公司是什麼時候開始瞭解到，在「外國園地」當中，有關於貴公司的文章？
en-US	Now, I’m going to ask accuser some questions. Accuser, when do you realize that some comments are posted on Foreign Land about your company?

en-US	This issue first came to our attention around December 2019. My wife and I personally were not active in that kind of forums. We were only informed by some friends about the malicious comments on Foreign Land until then.
zh-TW	我第一次知道此事是在2019年12月。我和我老婆在這樣的論壇並不活躍。我們是在那時才被朋友告知有這些惡意評論。

zh-TW	對於剛剛被告表示他只是提出一連串的問題，希望貴公司回答這些問題，並沒有以陳述方式毀謗貴公司的名譽。你有何意見？
en-US	According to the accused, he just posted a series of questions and hoped that the company can respond to him. He didn’t say something directly to defame your company. Did you have any opinion?

en-US	That’s not true. In English, even when comments are made in the question format, they still carry enough force to make readers wonder or question the facts implied by the questions. Even when the defendant said he only asked questions, damage was done to my company. 
zh-TW	這不是事實。在英文表達中，即使用問題方式評論，也能讓閱讀的人產生好奇或質疑事實。即使被告說他只是問問題，也足以毀謗我的公司。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，不管對方是否用問題方式提出質疑，你們公司的名譽實際上都有所損害嗎？請解釋一下。
en-US	Do you meant that whether the other party posted the questions, the company has been defamed? Can you explain?

en-US	Yes, when the defendant asked those questions, it caused doubt and suspicion in the circle of foreigners in Taiwan. Foreigners form their own circle here in Taiwan and rumors travel fast. That’s why even the Labor Bureau paid several visits to our company, trying to find out if we were involved in the matters posted on Foreign Land.
zh-TW	是的。當被告問了這些問題，就能讓這些住在台灣的外國人懷疑這間公司。這些外國人在這個論壇裡自成一圈。在這圈子裡，謠言傳得非常快。這就是爲什麼勞工局多次造訪我的公司，來看這些評論中的問題是否真的存在。

zh-TW	那勞工局前往貴公司瞭解外國人的雇用狀況，以及居留證的申請細節，有發現什麼不符合的地方嗎？
en-US	When the Labor Bureau went to the company to understand the situation of hiring the foreigner and their application of ARC, did anything happen which didn’t meet the requirements?

en-US	No, the representatives from the Bureau came but did not find anything wrong with our company or our hiring practice. 
zh-TW	沒有，勞工局派的代表並沒有查到任何不符規定的事。

zh-TW	如果勞工局的調查並沒有發現什麼不妥之處，或是違法之處，再加上剛剛被告也解釋，他撰寫這些文章的目的都只是希望貴公司能夠進行自清的動作，有沒有可能雙方進行和解呢？
en-US	If the Labor Bureau didn’t find anything which is illegal or not appropriate, just like the accused explained that he wrote these articles only to hope that the company can clarify, can both parties consider settlement?

en-US	We previously tried but failed to reach any conclusion. I would only consider settling this case with two things from the defendant. First, he has to formally apologize to Winwin for posting those inappropriate comments on Foreign Land. Second, as he said he heard all those details from “other foreign friends,” he should provide the names of those people to clear his own name.
zh-TW	我們之前有試著調解，但失敗了。我可以考慮和解，但對被告有兩件事的要求。第一，他必須為他不妥言論，正式向我的公司道歉。第二，如他剛才所說他是從其他外國朋友中聽到這些消息，他必須提供這些朋友的全名

zh-TW	被告，就像剛剛告訴人所指出，如果要進行和解，他希望由你這邊採取兩個行動，第一，正式道歉，對於在外國園地所發表的文章，不論你的文章是否造成告訴人公司實質上的名譽受損，對方都希望你提出道歉。第二，你剛剛前面指出，你是從一些外國友人那邊，聽到告訴人公司有違法對待外國勞工之嫌，你可以提供這些友人的姓名嗎？
en-US	The accused, just like accuser said, if you want a settlement, you need to take two actions. First, you need to apologize formally. For the comments you posted on Foreign Land, whether they constituted defamation, you need to apologize. Second, you have mentioned that you heard these things from your foreign friend. The company treated the employees illegally. Can you provide the names of your friends?

en-US	No, I would not consider these terms. First of all, I don’t know why I should apologize for posting some questions on the Internet. Since when is asking questions a crime? Second, Winwin cannot agree to settle the case with the term of obtaining names from me. This is not right.
zh-TW	不，我拒絕接受這些條件。第一點，我不懂為什麼我要為這些言論道歉，什麼時候問問題也犯法？第二，他不應該要我公開這些外國朋友的全名。

zh-TW	如果被告堅持因為文章的書寫內容都是以問題的方式進行，並沒有要毀謗告訴人公司的意圖，這顯然在第一個部分，你就是拒絕道歉，是嗎？
en-US	The accused, you insist that you wrote the comments in questions, and you didn’t intend to defame the company, so you won’t apologize, right?

en-US	No, I will not consider making an apology.
zh-TW	對，我拒絕道歉。

zh-TW	對於告訴人的第二個要求，你也拒絕。是因為擔心告訴人公司會對那些人進行相關的法律訴訟，是嗎？
en-US	You also reject the second condition. Is that because you afraid that the company will file a lawsuit against your foreign friends?

en-US	The thing is that some of the friends used to or may be currently working for Winwin. How could I jeopardize them just for the sake of settling my own case? Why should they suffer the potential harm? 
zh-TW	我擔心那些曾在那邊工作或是目前在那工作的朋友受害。我怎麼可以出賣這些朋友，就因為我想達成和解？為什麼他們要遭到這些傷害？

zh-TW	如果雙方無法就和解進行任何退讓，那麼法院這邊只能將這一次的準備程序內容進行彙整，以便進行下一次的審理程序。雙方的辯護人，是不是能夠針對和解這個選擇，再跟你們的當事人談一談呢？
en-US	The accuser, if both parties cannot reach a settlement, the court will collect the details for preparatory procedure and have next trial procedure. Today both parties have their lawyers. The lawyers of both parties, can you negotiate with your clients about settlement?

zh-TW	報告庭上，其實之前我們就有跟被告溝通，既然他說他的消息都是聽自其他友人，他大可以直接把那些人的名字提供給我們，而讓這一次的訴訟事件告一段落，但被告的態度一直很不合作，所以我們這邊也就無法進行進一步的和解動作。
en-US	Dear judge, I am the lawyer of the accuser. We used to negotiate with the defendant. The defendant said he heard information from his friends. He can provide their full names, so this case will be dismissed here. However, the defendant didn’t want to cooperate so we couldn’t reach an agreement.

zh-TW	報告鈞院，其實我的當事人會有這樣的顧慮，最主要是因為告訴人公司雇用很多外國人士，我的當事人不希望因為提供友人姓名一事，而讓過去或目前為告訴人公司服務的外國人士，惹上不必要的麻煩。望請鈞院了解。
en-US	Dear judge, I am the lawyer of the accused. The reason why my client has these concerns is because the accuser’s company applies many foreign employees. My client doesn’t want to provide the names of his foreign friends because he doesn’t want his friends to get into trouble. Hope you can understand.

zh-TW	既然告訴人跟被告雙方對於和解都各自有堅持，本庭定中華民國109年8月14日上午11點整進行審理程序。
en-US	Because both parties don’t reach a settlement, so the date of the trial procedure will set at 11 a.m. on August 14, 2020.

zh-TW	 請問被告，有無需要法院進一步調查之證據？
en-US	The defendant, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate?

en-US	No, your honor.
zh-TW	沒有，親愛的法官大人。

zh-TW	那告訴人這邊呢？
en-US	The accuser, do you have any evidence you hope the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I will think about it. If anything comes up, I will ask my lawyer to place a request to the court.
zh-TW	如果我有想到任何問題，我會請律師告知庭上。

zh-TW	那針對下一次的庭期，我們就不再發傳票，而是直接在庭直接以橘色小卡進行通知。請在簽完今天的筆錄後，領取小卡，再行離開。
en-US	About the next court date, we will not issue the subpoena. We will give you orange cards to inform you. Please sign your statement… The court is dismissed today.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？

en-US	Yes, I do.
zh-TW	是的，我了解。

zh-TW	請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the details of the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	As stated in the indictment. 

zh-TW	被告因妨害名譽案件被檢察官起訴，起因是被告涉嫌在中華民國108年12月1日到109年1月20日之間，在網際網路論壇，名為Foreign Land (外國園地)，發表一連串的評論，雖此論壇之主要目的是提供在台居留外國人士交流之平台，但被告卻利用這樣一個平台進行對告訴人公司之批評，致使告訴人公司名譽受損。對此妨害名譽之告訴，有何辯解？
en-US	The defendant, you are prosecuted for defamation. The reason is because during umm… December 1st, 2019 to January 20th, 2020, you posted a thread of comments on the social media on the Internet called Foreign Land. This platform’s intention is to let foreigners who live in Taiwan to communicate with each other, but you used this platform to criticize the accuser’s company, and defamed the company. And damaged the company’s reputation. As for the defamation crime, what’s your plea?

en-US	I plead not guilty.
zh-TW	我沒有罪。

zh-TW	請問你知道「外國園地」這個論壇嗎？
en-US	Defendant, do you know the internet platform Foreign Land?

en-US	Yes, Foreign Land is a forum very popular among foreigners.
zh-TW	我知道，因為外國園地在外國人…在我們外國人之間是很受歡迎的論壇。

zh-TW	可以簡要的描述你在這個平台上的活動嗎？
en-US	Can you briefly your activities on this platform?

en-US	I am a registered member, which means I can read others’ posts and post articles for others to read.
zh-TW	我是有註冊的會員，就是我可以看別人的文章，我也可以發布文章讓其他人看。

zh-TW	你常常在上面發表文章嗎，可以大概抓個頻率嗎，大概多久發表一篇文章？
en-US	So, do you often post comments on this platform

en-US	I won’t say I regularly post articles on Foreign Land. I only have postings when I want to share some concerns or vent my feelings. 
zh-TW	我不會說我常常在上面發文，我只有在..我只有在我關心的事情或我想要抒發情緒的時候才會發。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)65頁。這一頁是取自中華民國108年12月13日在「外國園地」中發表的內容。請你看一下，這是你寫的嗎？
en-US	Next, I am going to inform the investigatory paper number 1 page 65. This page is from the comments on Foreign Land December 13th, 2019. Is this the comments you posted?

en-US	It seems to be my posting but it was posted some time ago, I am not sure if the article is in its entirety.
zh-TW	這個看起來像是我發的，但是在很久以前，所以我也沒有辦法確定文章的完整度。

zh-TW	你在文中所提到的主要內容為何？請陳述。
en-US	Please state what you posted… the content of what you posted.

en-US	As you can see from the copy, I posted some concerns and questions regarding Winwin company, especially about how foreigners were treated by that company.
zh-TW	就像你所看到的一樣，我..我發表了 對於文文公司的問題，然後揭露外國人在這家公司是怎麼被對待的。

zh-TW	你剛剛講到的某一公司，請問有在任何一篇文章當中，明確指出該公司的全名嗎？
en-US	You have mentioned the company’s name. Do you remember if you have posted the full name of the company in any of your posts?

en-US	Yes, I am sure I have used the company’s full name, Winwin.
zh-TW	恩對阿，我有用公司的本名，文文。

zh-TW	你在65頁的內容中，提到該公司常常在雇用外國人時，沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利，更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況。請問，你這樣講，有證據嗎？
en-US	As stated in page 65, you stated that this company when hiring foreigners, they didn’t follow the Basic Labor Law of paying basic wage, and the time and rights. And you also mentioned that the company didn’t apply for foreigner’s visa, is this true?

en-US	I did mention those issues. I did not have evidence. I heard those issues from some other foreign friends who either worked for that company or had experiences with that company. As a result, I expressed my concerns in the question format, meaning I asked all those questions regarding working hours, basic salary, benefits and ARC application with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions.
zh-TW	我的確有聽到這些問題，但我沒有證據。我是從曾經在那家公司工作過的外國人那邊聽到這些消息的。因此我發表了我的意見…我用問的方式發表我的意見，其中提到了這個公司的基本工時、工資還有居留證的問題，希望文文公司可以….看到並且改善。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你是從其他外國朋友那邊聽到這些細節，但不是本人的第一手資料，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you heard this from foreigner friends and this information is not first hand?

en-US	True. I heard those details from other friends, also the registered members of Foreign Land.
zh-TW	沒錯，我是從朋友那邊聽來的，還有論壇上註冊的會員他們也這麼說。

zh-TW	那你怎麼可以在一個公開的論壇中，直接把聽來的東西，就做了轉述呢？
en-US	Then how can you… how can you post these comments on a public platform which is not first hand information?

en-US	I didn’t quote others and post the concerns as accusations. Instead, all my comments were questions. I was hoping Winwin would provide some sort of clarifications so that the foreign community would not hold any wrong ideas against that company.
zh-TW	我並沒有直接的….ㄟ…直接控告他所做的事情，我都用詢問的方式。我希望文文公司他們可以澄清這些不好的訊息，這樣子外國人也不會對他有不好的印象。

zh-TW	什麼叫做你都是用問題的方式來進行批評？可以解釋一下嗎？
en-US	What do you mean by you criticized by asking questions? Can you explain this?

en-US	For example, I asked in one posting “Is it true that Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC, the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally?”. 
zh-TW	舉例來說，我說文文公司他沒有幫外國人申請居留證……也就是在台灣工作的……..

zh-TW	所以你發表這一系列文章的目的只是為了釐清所謂的「真相」，是嗎？
en-US	So, the intention of you posting these comments is just to find out the truth?

en-US	Yes, I only wanted to get some clarifications or explanations. However, instead of responding to my questions directly, Winwin chose to file this lawsuit against me.
zh-TW	是的，我只是希望他可以澄清並且給大家一個交代。然而，文文公司不但沒有直接回答我的問題，反而是對我提起訴訟。

zh-TW	雖然告訴人有提供他們自外國園地抓下來文章內容，但他們也告訴檢方，這些內容並不完整。所以就你記憶所及，你大概連續發表了幾篇呢？
en-US	Although the accuser provided some comments from Foreign Land, they have said that these comments are not a whole. How many posts did you post on this platform?

en-US	As I stated before, it has been some time already. I cannot recall exactly how many articles I posted on Foreign Land, perhaps eight to ten? The problem is when this lawsuit began, the administrator of Foreign Land decided to delete my postings to avoid trouble. 
zh-TW	 就像我說過的，我偶爾會發，但是我沒有辦法確切記得我到底發了幾篇，我想大概是在8~10篇的範圍內，問題是當文文公司提起訴訟的時候，外國園地的版主決定刪掉我寫的那些文章來避免麻煩。

zh-TW	你的意思是說當這個訴訟開始進行的時候，那個論壇的版主就進行了刪文的動作嗎？
en-US	Do you mean after the lawsuit was filed, the administrator of Foreign Land just deleted all the posts?

en-US	Yes, that is correct.
zh-TW	沒有錯。

zh-TW	也就是說，你完全沒有辦法確定你一共為此事件發表過幾篇文章？
en-US	This also means that you cannot be sure that you posted… how many comments you posted about this incident, right?

en-US	That’s correct, too.
zh-TW	恩，你說的沒錯。

zh-TW	那就你記憶所及，你曾經接到過該公司任何希望你停止批評他們的要求嗎？你有照做嗎？
en-US	As far as you can remember, did the company tell you to stop your comments? And did you do so?

en-US	I think towards the end of my postings, I did get a request from Winwin, asking me to stop posting articles about their company. I didn’t stop immediately because, again, I was only asking questions.
zh-TW	沒錯，文文公司確實有要求我停止再發布這些文章，但我並沒有馬上停止這麼做，就像我說過的阿，我只是問問題而已。

zh-TW	所以你還是堅持，因為你都是用問題的方式來發表評論，並沒有直接毀謗該公司名譽的事實，是嗎？
en-US	So, the defendant, you mean you only criticized the company by asking questions and do not admit that you libeled the company, right?

en-US	It was never my intention to defame Winwin. I don’t quite understand how a series of questions could possibly constitute “defamation.”
zh-TW	妨害文文公司的名譽從來不是我的目的，我真的不能理解這些我問的問題會構成妨害名譽

zh-TW	那請問告訴人，貴公司是什麼時候開始瞭解到，在「外國園地」當中，有關於貴公司的文章？
en-US	Then I am going to ask the accuser some questions. So, the accuser, when do you realize that the accused post some articles on the Foreign Land about your company?

en-US	This issue first came to our attention around December 2019. My wife and I personally were not active in that kind of forums. We were only informed by some friends about the malicious comments on Foreign Land until then.
zh-TW	這個事件，我們公司第一次注意到這件事是在2019年的12月。我和我的老婆並沒有在那個論壇裡面很活躍。我們當時是被朋友告知有這些惡意的言論在該論壇上。

zh-TW	對於剛剛被告表示他只是提出一連串的問題，希望貴公司回答這些問題，並沒有以陳述方式毀謗貴公司的名譽。你有何意見？
en-US	Just.. as what the accused mentioned, he said that he just… he just post the article by asking questions instead of statement… instead of…instead of post the article in the form of statement.

en-US	That’s not true. In English, even when comments are made in the question format, they still carry enough force to make readers wonder or question the facts implied by the questions. Even when the defendant said he only asked questions, damage was done to my company. 
zh-TW	在英文裡面，即使是問問題的形式，文字也有足夠的力量可以讓閱讀的人覺得或懷疑那些事實。所以當被告說他用問問題的方式，也足以妨害我們公司的名譽。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，不管對方是否用問題方式提出質疑，你們公司的名譽實際上都有所損害嗎？請解釋一下。
en-US	Do you mean that, no matter…whether the accused use the …use the …the accused use …asking question form. Your …still be damage….

en-US	Yes, when the defendant asked those questions, it caused doubt and suspicion in the circle of foreigners in Taiwan. Foreigners form their own circle here in Taiwan and rumors travel fast. That’s why even the Labor Bureau paid several visits to our company, trying to find out if we were involved in the matters posted on Foreign Land.
zh-TW	是的，當被告她提出這些疑問的時候就在我們外國人的圈子裡面造成非常大的懷疑和不信任。外國人在台灣有自己的圈子，然後在這個圈子裏面有很多流言和消息都傳得很快。這就是為什麼台灣的勞工局多次造訪我們，也想要知道我們是否有捲進這起事件裡面。

zh-TW	那勞工局前往貴公司瞭解外國人的雇用狀況，以及居留證的申請細節，有發現什麼不符合的地方嗎？
en-US	So when the Labor Bureau come to your company, do they found out that your…the hiring conditions, ARC application is not reasonable?

en-US	No, the representatives from the Bureau came but did not find anything wrong with our company or our hiring practice. 
zh-TW	沒有，當勞工局的代表來的時候，他們沒有發現任何的問題。僱人方面也沒有任何問題。

zh-TW	如果勞工局的調查並沒有發現什麼不妥之處，或是違法之處，再加上剛剛被告也解釋，他撰寫這些文章的目的都只是希望貴公司能夠進行自清的動作，有沒有可能雙方進行和解呢？
en-US	So if the…if your hiring conditions and ARC application is…are nothing wrong. And the accused just hope that you can give a self-clarification. So will you consider to settle with him

en-US	We previously tried but failed to reach any conclusion. I would only consider settling this case with two things from the defendant. First, he has to formally apologize to Winwin for posting those inappropriate comments on Foreign Land. Second, as he said he heard all those details from “other foreign friends,” he should provide the names of those people to clear his own name.
zh-TW	我們之前已經嘗試過和解了，但我們沒有達到任何的協議。要我跟被告人進行和解，我有兩個條件。第一，他必須對文文公司提出非常的道歉。第二，他說他都是從其他外國朋友得知這些消息，所以他想要自清的話就需要提供這些人的全名。

zh-TW	被告，就像剛剛告訴人所指出，如果要進行和解，他希望由你這邊採取兩個行動，第一，正式道歉，對於在外國園地所發表的文章，不論你的文章是否造成告訴人公司實質上的名譽受損，對方都希望你提出道歉。第二，你剛剛前面指出，你是從一些外國友人那邊，聽到告訴人公司有違法對待外國勞工之嫌，你可以提供這些友人的姓名嗎？
en-US	The accused, just as what the accuser said, if you wan to settle, you need to take two actions that he requested. First, you need to apologize formally. According to your article, no matter…no matter the company…the company’s reputation was damaged, you need to apologize to them. Second, you said that you heard your friends tell you that the company…the company is illegal of the hiring rules. Can you provide those people’s name?

en-US	No, I would not consider these terms. First of all, I don’t know why I should apologize for posting some questions on the Internet. Since when is asking questions a crime? Second, Winwin cannot agree to settle the case with the term of obtaining names from me. This is not right.
zh-TW	不，我拒絕接受這兩個條件。第一，我不知道為什麼我只是發表一些評論就要道歉。從什麼時候開始問問題是一種罪? 第二，文文公司想要進行和解的方式是要公開我外國朋友的全名，我覺得這樣不合理。

zh-TW	如果被告堅持因為文章的書寫內容都是以問題的方式進行，並沒有要毀謗告訴人公司的意圖，這顯然在第一個部分，你就是拒絕道歉，是嗎？
en-US	The defendant, the accused, you insist that you just asking questions instead of Libel, so you refuse to apologize, right?

en-US	No, I will not consider making an apology.
zh-TW	對，我拒絕道歉。

zh-TW	對於告訴人的第二個要求，你也拒絕。是因為擔心告訴人公司會對那些人進行相關的法律訴訟，是嗎？
en-US	The reason why you refuse the second condition is because you afraid that the accuser will take a legal action against those foreign friends, right?

en-US	The thing is that some of the friends used to or may be currently working for Winwin. How could I jeopardize them just for the sake of settling my own case? Why should they suffer the potential harm? 
zh-TW	我擔心的是因為目前有人曾經或現在都還在文文公司工作。我怎麼可以出賣他們，就為了這個案子? 為什麼他們必須受到波及呢?

zh-TW	如果雙方無法就和解進行任何退讓，那麼法院這邊只能將這一次的準備程序內容進行彙整，以便進行下一次的審理程序。雙方的辯護人，是不是能夠針對和解這個選擇，再跟你們的當事人談一談呢？
en-US	The accuser…if the both parties cannot settle, we will consider…we will consider to…collect the information of this court and…have the next court. Today the both parties have their lawyers, so the lawyer of both parties, can you talk to your…clients about settlement?

zh-TW	報告庭上，其實之前我們就有跟被告溝通，既然他說他的消息都是聽自其他友人，他大可以直接把那些人的名字提供給我們，而讓這一次的訴訟事件告一段落，但被告的態度一直很不合作，所以我們這邊也就無法進行進一步的和解動作。
en-US	Your honor, I am the accuser’s lawyer. Your honor, we have actually negotiated with the accused. As he said, he only heard all these information from his foreigner friends, he could just provide the full names of these friends and the case would be closed. But the defendant is very uncooperative, so we cannot take a further step to settle this case.

zh-TW	報告鈞院，其實我的當事人會有這樣的顧慮，最主要是因為告訴人公司雇用很多外國人士，我的當事人不希望因為提供友人姓名一事，而讓過去或目前為告訴人公司服務的外國人士，惹上不必要的麻煩。望請鈞院了解。
en-US	Your honor, I’m the accused’s lawyer. The reason why my client is concerned is because there are many foreigners work in the company. My client didn’t…my client isn’t willing to provide his friends’ name just because he didn’t want those foreigners work in the company get into troubles. Please understand.

zh-TW	既然告訴人跟被告雙方對於和解都各自有堅持，本庭定中華民國109年8月14日上午11點整進行審理程序。
en-US	Since both parties have their own concerns and stances, the next court will be set at 11 o’clock on August 14th 2020. We will have a trial procedure

zh-TW	 請問被告，有無需要法院進一步調查之證據？
en-US	The accused, do you have evidence that need the court to help you investigate?

en-US	No, your honor.
zh-TW	沒有。

zh-TW	那告訴人這邊呢？
en-US	How about the accuser? Are there any evidence you want the court to investigate?

zh-TW	請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Saying as in the indictment.

zh-TW	被告因妨害名譽案件被檢察官起訴，起因是被告涉嫌在中華民國108年12月1日到109年1月20日之間，在網際網路論壇，名為Foreign Land (外國園地)，發表一連串的評論，雖此論壇之主要目的是提供在台居留外國人士交流之平台，但被告卻利用這樣一個平台進行對告訴人公司之批評，致使告訴人公司名譽受損。對此妨害名譽之告訴，有何辯解？
en-US	The defendant, you are prosecuted of violating an internet defamation. On December 1, 2019 to January 20, 2020, you were at an internet chatroom and you posted some comments. Although the purpose of this platform is to let some foreigners staying in Taiwan to exchange their thoughts. However, you posted some comments to criticize the accuser’s company, to damage the accuser’s reputation. What’s your plea?

en-US	I plead not guilty.
zh-TW	我沒有罪。

zh-TW	請問你知道「外國園地」這個論壇嗎？
en-US	I’m going to inquire the accused.The accused, do you know the forum of “Foreign Land”?

en-US	Yes, Foreign Land is a forum very popular among foreigners.
zh-TW	對啊，因為外國園地在外國人間是很受歡迎的。

zh-TW	可以簡要的描述你在這個平台上的活動嗎？
en-US	Could you briefly describe your activities on this forum?

en-US	I am a registered member, which means I can read others’ posts and post articles for others to read.
zh-TW	我是一個已經註冊的會員，所以我可以看到他人的貼文以及我自己也可以發布貼文與他人分享

zh-TW	你常常在上面發表文章嗎，可以大概抓個頻率嗎，大概多久發表一篇文章？
en-US	How often do you post a feed?

en-US	I won’t say I regularly post articles on Foreign Land. I only have postings when I want to share some concerns or vent my feelings. 
zh-TW	我不會說我有一個發文的頻率。我只在我關心些議題或想抒發感受的時候才會發文。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)65頁。這一頁是取自中華民國108年12月13日在「外國園地」中發表的內容。請你看一下，這是你寫的嗎？
en-US	Now I’m going to read the investigation procedure page 65.This page describes a content from Foreign Land on December 13, 2019. Is this post written by you?

en-US	It seems to be my posting but it was posted some time ago, I am not sure if the article is in its entirety.
zh-TW	這篇好像是我寫的但是因為已經是一段時間以前的了，所以我不太確定這篇的完整性。

zh-TW	你在文中所提到的主要內容為何？請陳述。
en-US	Could you please state the main idea to the court?

en-US	As you can see from the copy, I posted some concerns and questions regarding Winwin company, especially about how foreigners were treated by that company.
zh-TW	就像你們可以看到的這篇貼文，我在上頭寫了一些我的疑慮以及問題，關於雙贏這個公司它們是怎麼對待外國人的。

zh-TW	你剛剛講到的某一公司，請問有在任何一篇文章當中，明確指出該公司的全名嗎？
en-US	You just mention company’s name, and did you state clearly of the company’s full name on any posts?

en-US	Yes, I am sure I have used the company’s full name, Winwin.
zh-TW	是的，我很確定我有用雙贏公司的全名。

zh-TW	你在65頁的內容中，提到該公司常常在雇用外國人時，沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利，更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況。請問，你這樣講，有證據嗎？
en-US	You mentioned in page 65 that when the company is hiring a foreigner, they often violate the Basic Labor Law, the basic labor hour, and wage and welfare.Moreover, you mention that, from time to time when the company isn’t applying the working VISA for the foreign, do you have any evidence regarding this?

en-US	I did mention those issues. I did not have evidence. I heard those issues from some other foreign friends who either worked for that company or had experiences with that company. As a result, I expressed my concerns in the question format, meaning I asked all those questions regarding working hours, basic salary, benefits and ARC application with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions.
zh-TW	我有提到這件事情但我還沒有證據。我有從一些外國朋友口中聽說，而那些朋友都是在公司工作或是和那些人交手過的。所以我用問問題的方式來表達我的想法，我的意思是我的問題都是有關勞基法、基本工時、基本薪資以及福利，以及雙贏公司是怎麼對外國居留證申請的方式，所以我希望他們可以出面澄清這個問題。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你是從其他外國朋友那邊聽到這些細節，但不是本人的第一手資料，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you obtain this information from other friends, and these details are not firsthand information, right?

en-US	True. I heard those details from other friends, also the registered members of Foreign Land.
zh-TW	沒錯我就是從其他外國朋友那邊聽來的，以及從外國園地的註冊會員。

zh-TW	那你怎麼可以在一個公開的論壇中，直接把聽來的東西，就做了轉述呢？
en-US	So how can you in such public forum and directly state what you have heard on the post?

en-US	I didn’t quote others and post the concerns as accusations. Instead, all my comments were questions. I was hoping Winwin would provide some sort of clarifications so that the foreign community would not hold any wrong ideas against that company.
zh-TW	我並沒有引述其他人說的話在我的貼文當中，也不是控告的形式，我只是用問題的方式呈現。我只是希望雙贏公司可以提供某些形式的澄清，所以在我們的社群當中，才不會給外國人有錯誤的印象。

zh-TW	什麼叫做你都是用問題的方式來進行批評？可以解釋一下嗎？
en-US	What do you mean by asking questions? Could you explain further?

en-US	For example, I asked in one posting “Is it true that Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC, the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally?”. 
zh-TW	舉例來說，我曾在一篇貼文問說，雙贏公司是否真的沒有幫助外國人申請居留證，也就是他們可以合法在台工作的權利。

zh-TW	所以你發表這一系列文章的目的只是為了釐清所謂的「真相」，是嗎？
en-US	So your purposes of this post are finding out the truth, right?

en-US	Yes, I only wanted to get some clarifications or explanations. However, instead of responding to my questions directly, Winwin chose to file this lawsuit against me.
zh-TW	是的，我只想要得到他們的澄清或解釋。然而，他們並沒有直接的回應我，雙贏公司選擇了控告我的方式。

zh-TW	雖然告訴人有提供他們自外國園地抓下來文章內容，但他們也告訴檢方，這些內容並不完整。所以就你記憶所及，你大概連續發表了幾篇呢？
en-US	Although the accuser provide some articles contents, they have informed that these informations are not complete. How many post have you posts?

en-US	As I stated before, it has been some time already. I cannot recall exactly how many articles I posted on Foreign Land, perhaps eight to ten? The problem is when this lawsuit began, the administrator of Foreign Land decided to delete my postings to avoid trouble. 
zh-TW	就像我之前說過的，這些貼文已經有段時間了，就我記憶所及，大概只能想起來我大概發了8到10篇。問題是，當他們對我提出告訴時，版主就會刪除這些文章來避免不必要的麻煩。

zh-TW	你的意思是說當這個訴訟開始進行的時候，那個論壇的版主就進行了刪文的動作嗎？
en-US	What you meant was when the lawsuit came to effect, the administrator will delete all the post?

en-US	Yes, that is correct.
zh-TW	沒錯。

zh-TW	也就是說，你完全沒有辦法確定你一共為此事件發表過幾篇文章？
en-US	That is you still aren’t that sure how many post you have posted upon this issue?

en-US	That’s correct, too.
zh-TW	也沒錯。

zh-TW	那就你記憶所及，你曾經接到過該公司任何希望你停止批評他們的要求嗎？你有照做嗎？
en-US	In your memory, did the company send you any requirement or warning to stop posting?

en-US	I think towards the end of my postings, I did get a request from Winwin, asking me to stop posting articles about their company. I didn’t stop immediately because, again, I was only asking questions.
zh-TW	在我停止發文之前，都沒有收到任何要我停止發文的消息。我沒有立即停止發文，因為就像我之前所說的，我只是在問問題而已。

zh-TW	所以你還是堅持，因為你都是用問題的方式來發表評論，並沒有直接毀謗該公司名譽的事實，是嗎？
en-US	So the defendant, you still insist that you are posting in the form of posting questions, instead of directly libeling the company to damage their reputation. Is that right?

en-US	It was never my intention to defame Winwin. I don’t quite understand how a series of questions could possibly constitute “defamation.”
zh-TW	我從來就沒有想過要妨害雙贏公司的名譽。我還是不太了解一連串的問題會構成妨害名譽或毀謗。

zh-TW	那請問告訴人，貴公司是什麼時候開始瞭解到，在「外國園地」當中，有關於貴公司的文章？
en-US	Next I will ask the plaintiff some questions. Plaintiff, when did you find that there are some comments about your company?

en-US	This issue first came to our attention around December 2019. My wife and I personally were not active in that kind of forums. We were only informed by some friends about the malicious comments on Foreign Land until then.
zh-TW	這些問題主要首次是在2019年12月我們有意識到。我跟我老婆一開始並沒有在這個論壇上很活躍。我們是在朋友跟我們告知有這些惡意的評論之後才意識到這件事情。

zh-TW	對於剛剛被告表示他只是提出一連串的問題，希望貴公司回答這些問題，並沒有以陳述方式毀謗貴公司的名譽。你有何意見？
en-US	The defendent said that he didn‘t he just wrote the comment in the form of asking questions instead of statements. About this, what’s your idea?

en-US	That’s not true. In English, even when comments are made in the question format, they still carry enough force to make readers wonder or question the facts implied by the questions. Even when the defendant said he only asked questions, damage was done to my company. 
zh-TW	這不對。這在英文裡面，即使是用問題的形式，它也是有強力的作用去質疑事實。也就是說，當被告問了這些問題的時候，他對我們的公司就造成了毁謗、造成我們的名譽受損。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，不管對方是否用問題方式提出質疑，你們公司的名譽實際上都有所損害嗎？請解釋一下。
en-US	Can you make a further explanation that no matter the defendant used the question or not, your company...the reputation of your company is still damaged?

en-US	Yes, when the defendant asked those questions, it caused doubt and suspicion in the circle of foreigners in Taiwan. Foreigners form their own circle here in Taiwan and rumors travel fast. That’s why even the Labor Bureau paid several visits to our company, trying to find out if we were involved in the matters posted on Foreign Land.
zh-TW	沒錯，被告的確造成了一些質疑。公司的確受到損害了，因為這些謠言都已經傳遍了。台灣的勞工局也有來造訪我們，去試圖找出我們是否牽涉其中。

zh-TW	那勞工局前往貴公司瞭解外國人的雇用狀況，以及居留證的申請細節，有發現什麼不符合的地方嗎？
en-US	So when Labor Bureau went to visit your company and asked you about the your hiring and applying for ARC, are there any violations of your rule?

en-US	No, the representatives from the Bureau came but did not find anything wrong with our company or our hiring practice. 
zh-TW	沒有，他們有過來探視但沒有發現任何問題，在申請上面都沒有問題。

zh-TW	如果勞工局的調查並沒有發現什麼不妥之處，或是違法之處，再加上剛剛被告也解釋，他撰寫這些文章的目的都只是希望貴公司能夠進行自清的動作，有沒有可能雙方進行和解呢？
en-US	If the Labor Bureau did not find anything wrong in your company. Furthermore, the aim of the defendant’s asking your question is to want to get your self-clarification; as a result, is there any chance for you to make a settlement?

en-US	We previously tried but failed to reach any conclusion. I would only consider settling this case with two things from the defendant. First, he has to formally apologize to Winwin for posting those inappropriate comments on Foreign Land. Second, as he said he heard all those details from “other foreign friends,” he should provide the names of those people to clear his own name.
zh-TW	我們之前有試過，但最後都沒有達到任何共識。我只對這個被告要求兩件事。第一件事情，我只希望他能公開道歉，說明他對外國園地的毀謗。第二，就像他說的，他是從其他人那邊聽到這些消息細節的，他應該要提供到底確切是從哪些人聽到的。

zh-TW	被告，就像剛剛告訴人所指出，如果要進行和解，他希望由你這邊採取兩個行動，第一，正式道歉，對於在外國園地所發表的文章，不論你的文章是否造成告訴人公司實質上的名譽受損，對方都希望你提出道歉。第二，你剛剛前面指出，你是從一些外國友人那邊，聽到告訴人公司有違法對待外國勞工之嫌，你可以提供這些友人的姓名嗎？
en-US	Defendant, as the accuser required, if you want to reach a settlement, you have to take the following two actions...the above mentioned two actions. First, you have to apologize formally. Regarding your posts on the Foreign Land, no matter you had caused damage to their reputation... As you mentioned before, you have heard these rumors from your foreign friends, and could you please provide those friends’ names, since you are suspected of violating defamation.

en-US	No, I would not consider these terms. First of all, I don’t know why I should apologize for posting some questions on the Internet. Since when is asking questions a crime? Second, Winwin cannot agree to settle the case with the term of obtaining names from me. This is not right.
zh-TW	不，我不會考慮以上兩個方式。首先，我還是不懂為什麼我只是問一些問題就要受到處罰。從什麼時候開始問問題變成一種罪？第二，雙贏公司並不同意要和解，若是我提供這些人的姓名。

zh-TW	如果被告堅持因為文章的書寫內容都是以問題的方式進行，並沒有要毀謗告訴人公司的意圖，這顯然在第一個部分，你就是拒絕道歉，是嗎？
en-US	The defendant you insist that you are writing these posts in the form of asking questions, so you refuse to apologize, right?

en-US	No, I will not consider making an apology.
zh-TW	不，我並不考慮要道歉。

zh-TW	對於告訴人的第二個要求，你也拒絕。是因為擔心告訴人公司會對那些人進行相關的法律訴訟，是嗎？
en-US	As for the second request of the accuser, do you worry that your foreign friends will be filed a lawsuit against?

en-US	The thing is that some of the friends used to or may be currently working for Winwin. How could I jeopardize them just for the sake of settling my own case? Why should they suffer the potential harm? 
zh-TW	重點是，有些友人是曾經或是現在正在雙贏工作的。我怎麼忍心讓他們暴露在危險當中，只是為了要和解？為什麼他們要暴露在這些潛在的危險當中？

zh-TW	如果雙方無法就和解進行任何退讓，那麼法院這邊只能將這一次的準備程序內容進行彙整，以便進行下一次的審理程序。雙方的辯護人，是不是能夠針對和解這個選擇，再跟你們的當事人談一談呢？
en-US	The accuser if you don’t want to make any compromise against this settlement, we will gathering this information together to be the next court’s evidence. Today, the accuser and the defendant both have their lawyer. Regarding settlement, can both the lawyer talk to your client?

zh-TW	報告庭上，其實之前我們就有跟被告溝通，既然他說他的消息都是聽自其他友人，他大可以直接把那些人的名字提供給我們，而讓這一次的訴訟事件告一段落，但被告的態度一直很不合作，所以我們這邊也就無法進行進一步的和解動作。
en-US	Your Honor, I am the lawyer of the accuser. Your Honor, actually we have talked to the defendant before. Since the defendant obtained those details from his friends, Therefore, he can provide us the names of his friends and let the court to come to an end. However, the defendant is unwilling to cooperate with us, so the settlement cannot be made.

zh-TW	報告鈞院，其實我的當事人會有這樣的顧慮，最主要是因為告訴人公司雇用很多外國人士，我的當事人不希望因為提供友人姓名一事，而讓過去或目前為告訴人公司服務的外國人士，惹上不必要的麻煩。望請鈞院了解。
en-US	Your Honor, I’m the lawyer of the defendant. Actually, the concerns... the main concerns of my client is that your company has hired many of his friends. My client doesn’t hope to provide those names since those friends are...used to work in your company or currently work in your company, so he doesn’t want them to get into trouble. Your Honor, hope you can understand.

zh-TW	既然告訴人跟被告雙方對於和解都各自有堅持，本庭定中華民國109年8月14日上午11點整進行審理程序。
en-US	Since that both parties are hold their own insistence, so we will set the next court, the trial procedure on at 11 AM on August 14, 2020.

zh-TW	 請問被告，有無需要法院進一步調查之證據？
en-US	The dependent, do you need any further investigation, the court can help you.

en-US	No, your honor.
zh-TW	不，沒有。

zh-TW	那告訴人這邊呢？
en-US	How about the accuser, do you want the court to help you investigate any evidence?

en-US	I will think about it. If anything comes up, I will ask my lawyer to place a request to the court.
zh-TW	讓我們再思考一下，如果需要的話我會請我的律師再跟庭上詢問。

zh-TW	那針對下一次的庭期，我們就不再發傳票，而是直接在庭直接以橘色小卡進行通知。請在簽完今天的筆錄後，領取小卡，再行離開。
en-US	About the next court, we will not send you any subpoena. Instead, we will send you the orange card for you. After you take your statement, you can get the orange card and go. So the procedure ends here.

zh-TW	請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please….

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	As the indictment.

zh-TW	被告，你被檢察官起訴在民國109年3月8日於新北市樹林區學府路與大學路交叉口、7-11門口前，盜取他人摩托車一輛，車牌號碼為BL-1234，經由摩托車持有人報案後，警方於柑園路一段25號附近尋獲。經警方調閱7-11門口監視器，確認摩托車為你所竊，有何辯解？
en-US	The defendant, you are prosecuted by the prosecutor that on March 8th 2020, on the door of a 7-11 at the intersection of Xuefu Rd and Daxue Rd you stole a motorcycle which had the plate number BL-1234. After the owner of the motorcycle reported the case to the police, the police found the motorcycle around Ganyuan Rd, Sec 1. After the police checked the CCTV clip…

en-US	 I did not steal the motorcycle. On that day, it was rainy very hard. My friend and I did not bring an umbrella and we were in a hurry to get home. So, we decided to borrow the motorcycle. Our plan was to give it back, you know, we planned to put the motorbike back to the original place the second day. We didn’t mean to steal it at all.
zh-TW	我沒有偷那輛摩托車，那天，雨下得很大，我和我的朋友沒有帶傘，但是我們急著回家，所以我們決定「借用」一下那輛摩托車，我們有打算要還回去，真的，我們想說隔天把摩托車放回原來的地方，我們真的沒有要偷的意思。

zh-TW	沒有帶傘就可以偷人家車子嗎？
en-US	Can you stole the motorcycle when you did not bring an umbrella? 

en-US	No, but I was in a hurry to go home that day. My plane was leaving on the second day to go back to my country. I am really sorry. That was a terrible mistake.
zh-TW	不行，但那天下大雨而且我趕著回家，我回國的飛機在明天就會到達，我知道我犯了大錯，感到非常抱歉。

zh-TW	為什麼會偷那部車子呢？我的意思是為什麼是那部，而不是別部車呢
en-US	Why did you steal that car instead of other cars?

en-US	At that time, I just came out from the convenience store. It was raining and I saw that motorcycle. I realized the owner must have forgotten to take out the key. I thought I could use it briefly and bring it back soon.
zh-TW	那時，我剛從便利商店出來，我看到了那輛摩托車，發現車主應該是忘記拿走他的車鑰匙了，我想我可以稍微借用一下，再很快的還回來。

zh-TW	你的意思是那個摩托車的主人，忘了把鑰匙拿走嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the owner of the motorcycle forgot to remove the key?

en-US	Yes, the key was left in the ignition, so I just rode the motorbike away.
zh-TW	是的，鑰匙還留在鑰匙孔裡，所以我就把它騎走了。

zh-TW	那你剛剛說，原來的計畫是要把車子還回去，那你有這樣做嗎？
en-US	You said that you planned to give the motorcycle back, so at last, did you do so?

en-US	After we rode the bike away, I first gave my friend a ride home. Then I went back to my apartment. I was very tired and went to bed directly. I was thinking to return the motorbike the next day. But, on the second day, my plane was leaving so I totally forgot about this plan. 
zh-TW	我們騎走摩托車後，我先把我的朋友載回他家，然後我再回去我的公寓，那時我已經很累，所以我就直接去睡覺，隔天我就想要把它還回去了，但是，我隔天忙著要處理回國的事，所以我就完全忘記這件事了。

zh-TW	那為什麼車子後來會跑到柑園路去了呢？
en-US	How did the motorcycle end up in Ganyuan Rd?

en-US	I don’t know. I talked to my landlord. He told me that he didn’t know whose motorbike that was. He didn’t feel comfortable about having it parked in front of our apartment building. Maybe the motorbike was moved there.
zh-TW	我不知道，我有跟我的房東說這件事，他跟我說他不知道那是誰的摩托車，他覺得放在大樓前面不妥，也許摩托車是被移去那裡了。

zh-TW	你知道後來摩托車主人報警了吧？在我們的法律上，竊盜罪是告訴乃論，也就是說，如果摩托車的主人願意不告你的話，那這個案子就可以撤掉，那你後來有跟對方有任何的溝通嗎？
en-US	You know that the owner of the motorcycle call for the police, right? In our country, the theft is a criminal brought to the court only when a lawsuit is filed. Which means that if the owner file a suit for you, this case can be removed. Then, did you try to communicate with the accuser?

en-US	Yes, when I returned to Taiwan after that trip, the police told me about this case. I met with the motorbike owner. I said sorry to him and agreed to offer him some money.
zh-TW	null

zh-TW	那調解的過程怎麼樣，對方願意接受你的道歉嗎？
en-US	How did the mediation go? Does the other party accept your apology?

en-US	We reached an agreement at the amount of NT$6,000. The owner accepted my apology. He brought the motorbike to the shop to have a check. The bike was not damaged and just needed a small tune-up.
zh-TW	我們用6000元達成和解，車主接受了我的道歉，他把他的機車帶到機車行檢查，摩托車沒有甚麼大問題，只要小小維修一下。

zh-TW	雙方有達成和解金的數字嗎？
en-US	Did both party have a consensus on settlement amount?

en-US	Yes, NT$6,000 and I gave the money to the owner already.
zh-TW	是的，我會賠償他6000元，然後我已經把錢給他了。

zh-TW	那你們什麼時候要簽和解書呢，還是已經簽了呢？
en-US	When will you sign up the settlement letter, or have you already signed up?

en-US	We signed the settlement letter.
zh-TW	我們已經簽好和解書了。

zh-TW	那今天有帶來嗎？

en-US	As stated in the indictment.

zh-TW	被告，你被檢察官起訴在民國109年3月8日於新北市樹林區學府路與大學路交叉口、7-11門口前，盜取他人摩托車一輛，車牌號碼為BL-1234，經由摩托車持有人報案後，警方於柑園路一段25號附近尋獲。經警方調閱7-11門口監視器，確認摩托車為你所竊，有何辯解？
en-US	This incident happened on March 8, 2020. The location was in front of the 711 at the intersection of the 學府road and 大學road in 樹林district, New Taipei City. You stole the motorcycle. The plate number is BL-1234. After the owner of motorcycle reported the case, the police found the motorcycle around柑園road section one. After the police saw the CCTV clips in front of the 711, …

en-US	 I did not steal the motorcycle. On that day, it was rainy very hard. My friend and I did not bring an umbrella and we were in a hurry to get home. So, we decided to borrow the motorcycle. Our plan was to give it back, you know, we planned to put the motorbike back to the original place the second day. We didn’t mean to steal it at all.
zh-TW	我沒有罪，我沒有偷摩托車。那天雨下得很大，我和我的朋友沒有帶雨傘，所以我們趕快回家，所以我們決定借摩托車，我們原本就計畫好在第二天還回去，我們不是故意要偷的。

zh-TW	沒有帶傘就可以偷人家車子嗎？
en-US	You didn’t bring your umbrella, so you stole the motorcycle?

en-US	No, but I was in a hurry to go home that day. My plane was leaving on the second day to go back to my country. I am really sorry. That was a terrible mistake.
zh-TW	沒有，我只是想要趕快回家。我要搭隔天的飛機回我的國家。我很抱歉犯了這麼大的錯誤。

zh-TW	為什麼會偷那部車子呢？我的意思是為什麼是那部，而不是別部車呢
en-US	So why did you steal that car? I mean that why did you steal that car but not other car?

en-US	At that time, I just came out from the convenience store. It was raining and I saw that motorcycle. I realized the owner must have forgotten to take out the key. I thought I could use it briefly and bring it back soon.
zh-TW	那時候我正剛走出便利商店，那時下著雨，我看到了一台摩托車，我發現車主忘記拔鑰匙了，我覺得我可以很快用它然後再還回去。

zh-TW	你的意思是那個摩托車的主人，忘了把鑰匙拿走嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the owner of the motorcycle left the key in the ignition?

en-US	Yes, the key was left in the ignition, so I just rode the motorbike away.
zh-TW	對，他的車鑰匙忘記拔了，所以我就騎走了。

zh-TW	那你剛剛說，原來的計畫是要把車子還回去，那你有這樣做嗎？
en-US	You said you would turn the motorcycle back as planned, did you do that?

en-US	After we rode the bike away, I first gave my friend a ride home. Then I went back to my apartment. I was very tired and went to bed directly. I was thinking to return the motorbike the next day. But, on the second day, my plane was leaving so I totally forgot about this plan. 
zh-TW	在我騎走摩托車後，我先載我朋友回家，然後再回去我的公寓。那時，我很累所以就直接睡覺了。我原本預計隔天還回去。然而，隔天飛機起飛，所以就完全忘了這個計畫。

zh-TW	那為什麼車子後來會跑到柑園路去了呢？
en-US	Then, why the motorcycle was at Ganyuan road section 1?

en-US	I don’t know. I talked to my landlord. He told me that he didn’t know whose motorbike that was. He didn’t feel comfortable about having it parked in front of our apartment building. Maybe the motorbike was moved there.
zh-TW	我不知道為什麼，我有跟我的房東講這件事，他有跟我說他不知道那個摩托車是誰的，他覺得摩托車停在公寓前面是很不好的，所以可能摩托車就被移到那邊了。

zh-TW	你知道後來摩托車主人報警了吧？在我們的法律上，竊盜罪是告訴乃論，也就是說，如果摩托車的主人願意不告你的話，那這個案子就可以撤掉，那你後來有跟對方有任何的溝通嗎？
en-US	Did you know the owner of the motorcycle reported the case to the police, right? As our law, theft is a case that is substantiated when you file a lawsuit. That is, if the owner of the motorcycle doesn’t sue you, the case can be dropped. Did you try to communicate with the other party?

en-US	Yes, when I returned to Taiwan after that trip, the police told me about this case. I met with the motorbike owner. I said sorry to him and agreed to offer him some money.
zh-TW	是的，當我回來台灣的時候，警察有跟我講這個案件，我和車主聯繫，我向他道歉並且同意付他賠償金。

zh-TW	那調解的過程怎麼樣，對方願意接受你的道歉嗎？
en-US	So how was the process of mediation? Does the other party accept your apology?

en-US	We reached an agreement at the amount of NT$6,000. The owner accepted my apology. He brought the motorbike to the shop to have a check. The bike was not damaged and just needed a small tune-up.
zh-TW	我們達成協議，我付他6000元賠償金。他也接受我的道歉。他把車牽到維修廠檢查，摩托車沒有太大損壞，只需要小小維修。

zh-TW	雙方有達成和解金的數字嗎？
en-US	Did both parties decide the settlement amount?

en-US	Yes, NT$6,000 and I gave the money to the owner already.
zh-TW	是的，就如我剛剛所說，我已給他6000元的賠償金。

zh-TW	那你們什麼時候要簽和解書呢，還是已經簽了呢？
en-US	When will you sign the settlement contract? Or you have already settled this case?

en-US	We signed the settlement letter.
zh-TW	我們已經簽和解書了。

zh-TW	那今天有帶來嗎？
en-US	Do you bring that here?

en-US	Today is the preparatory procedure. We will set the date next time and please bring the settlement here next time. Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate? Do you want your friend who was with you to be subpoenaed to the court? I mean, do you want your friend to help you describe the details of the case?

en-US	My friend is in Taiwan now. Maybe he can help explain what happened that day. He knew that I planned to return the motorbike. I really meant it.
zh-TW	我的朋友已經回台灣了，也許他能幫我解釋案發狀況，他知道我原本就預計要還摩托車。

zh-TW	那這樣子，我們下一次開庭的時候，會請你的朋友，也就是Mark Alison到庭，說明當天的情況，也會請摩托車所有人，也就是當事人到庭，說明和解的細由。
en-US	Ok, so we’ll subpoena your friend, Mark Alison, to the next court to describe the details of the case. We’ll also ask the owner of the motorcycle to the court to describe the settlement details.

en-US	Do you have any further questions?

zh-TW	在我們騎走之後，我讓我朋友騎回家，然後我就回我的公寓了。因為太累了，我就直接去睡了。我想說明天在還回去就好了，可是因為隔天我就要走了，所以我完全忘了這回事。

zh-TW	那為什麼車子後來會跑到柑園路去了呢？
en-US	Then why did the motorcycle end up at Gan-Yuan Road?

en-US	I don’t know. I talked to my landlord. He told me that he didn’t know whose motorbike that was. He didn’t feel comfortable about having it parked in front of our apartment building. Maybe the motorbike was moved there.
zh-TW	我不知道，但我跟地主談過了。他告訴我她不太知道那台摩托車是誰的。他覺得把這台摩托車停在我們租的這棟大樓前面感到很不舒服。所以也許這台摩托車被他移動到那了。

zh-TW	你知道後來摩托車主人報警了吧？在我們的法律上，竊盜罪是告訴乃論，也就是說，如果摩托車的主人願意不告你的話，那這個案子就可以撤掉，那你後來有跟對方有任何的溝通嗎？
en-US	Do you know that the owner of the motorcycle have called the police? According to our law, theft is a crime is brought to the court only when the lawsuit is filed. That is to say, if the owner of the motorcycle decided not to sue you, and the case will be….will be …..dropped. Do you have.. Do you try to communicate with the other party?

en-US	Yes, when I returned to Taiwan after that trip, the police told me about this case. I met with the motorbike owner. I said sorry to him and agreed to offer him some money.
zh-TW	有的，我回台灣的時候警察有告知我關於這個案件的詳情。我和摩托車車主見了面。我跟他說了對不起然後同意提供金錢賠償。

zh-TW	那調解的過程怎麼樣，對方願意接受你的道歉嗎？
en-US	Then how was the mediation? Did the other party accept your conditions?

en-US	We reached an agreement at the amount of NT$6,000. The owner accepted my apology. He brought the motorbike to the shop to have a check. The bike was not damaged and just needed a small tune-up.
zh-TW	我們達成了共識，決定我要賠他6000元。而摩托車的車主接受了我的道歉，他把他的車子帶去檢查，摩托車並沒有壞掉，只是需要一點小小的維修。

zh-TW	雙方有達成和解金的數字嗎？
en-US	Did… did both of you reach the …. mediation amount?

en-US	Yes, NT$6,000 and I gave the money to the owner already.
zh-TW	有阿，我們決定和解金是6000元，我也把錢給他了。

zh-TW	那你們什麼時候要簽和解書呢，還是已經簽了呢？
en-US	Then when are you going to sign the settlement paper? Or have you signed it already?

en-US	We signed the settlement letter.
zh-TW	我們已經簽了和解書了。

zh-TW	那今天有帶來嗎？
en-US	Then did you bring it today?

en-US	I have the copy at home but I can bring it next time.
zh-TW	在家有影本，但是我下次可以帶來。

zh-TW	我們今天的程序是準備程序，會訂下一次的庭期，請你把和解書正本帶過來，那你還有沒有什麼要請法庭幫你調查的證據呢？那天跟你在一起的朋友，你希望法庭傳喚他做證人嗎？我的意思是，你需不需要他來幫忙你說明這個案情？
en-US	Our case today is a preparatory procedure. We will set the date of the next court, and please bring the settlement paper with you next time. Do you need other…investigation that need court to help you? Do you hope to…do you hope that we supo… supone your friend? I mean that do you need … do you need your friend to help you explain the case?

en-US	My friend is in Taiwan now. Maybe he can help explain what happened that day. He knew that I planned to return the motorbike. I really meant it.
zh-TW	我朋友現在在台灣，也許他可以一起解釋那天發生了什麼。他知道我打算要把車子還回去。

zh-TW	那這樣子，我們下一次開庭的時候，會請你的朋友，也就是Mark Alison到庭，說明當天的情況，也會請摩托車所有人，也就是當事人到庭，說明和解的細由。
en-US	So, so we will invite your friend, Mark, to come here and explain what happened that day. We will also invite the .. the owner of the motorcycle, the involved party to come here and explained the settlement details.

zh-TW	檢察官有無意見？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have anything to say?

zh-TW	沒有意見。
en-US	No.

zh-TW	檢察官這邊有沒有需要再調查的證據？
en-US	And Prosecutor, do you have any evidence to be investigated?

zh-TW	沒有。
en-US	No.

zh-TW	本案訂中華民國109年8月3日早上9點30分進行審理程序，會再寄傳票通知涉案人，請務必到庭，如果被告覺得需要辯護人的協助，可選任辯護人或申請公共辯護人。今天程序到此為止
en-US	The case will be set on August 3rd at 8:30 am to be… for a trial procedure. The court will send a subpoena for more further information. If the defendant needs a lawyer, then he can choose a lawyer or a public… or a probono. The case will be dismissed.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解了。

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	First, please, the prosecutor states the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The plaintiff…the plaintiff…the plaintiff wanted to file the case against his… her husband for… for the suspect that he is having an affair with his coworkers. Because she has found some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphones, and, sometimes, her husband would make up reasons for extra hours for the… his work. Also, he would have tele-conference with his coworkers, so the plaintiff is suspect that her husband has a relationship with his coworker beyond coworker’s relationship. The defendant, your wife sue you with the adultery case, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然無罪。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s procedure, first, we are going to examine the text messages between the defendant and his coworker, and we will…we will decided whether this message would constitute adultery case. Does the plaintiff…Do the plaintiff and the defendant fully understand today’s procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, I want to ask the plaintiff, how long have you been married? Do you guys have kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for 4 years, and we didn’t.. and we don’t have kids.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	So…did you and your husband get married in Taiwan, or you get married in foreign country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	My husband and I met in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he was here to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	Then, during the past few years, is his job in Taiwan teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a teacher to teach Portuguese. Then, after we get married, he still teaching Portuguese. However, in Taiwan, Portuguese is not a popular language to learn from, so, sometimes, he didn’t have a… his teaching hour is not stable or regular, and sometimes, there are a period between jobs that is as long as a month or even two month. Then , in order to have a steady and stable incomes, he decided to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree on English.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. It means that he seek an advanced degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wanted to teach English, so the degree of his seeking has to be about English teaching. He found an Internet courses about distance learning program in the University of California, and this course is that he doesn’t have to go to America to learn, but he can have a distance learning in Taiwan about English teaching. So after he finishes all the credits of the internet courses, then he can get a master degree. Therefore, he can use this American advanced degree to English teaching job in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then... What is his relationship with the person he had affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are the coworkers in the cram school. And in the cram school, they have a program that a Chinese teacher would partner up with an foreign teacher, so the woman is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know that they are having an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At the beginning, I found out that he started to work over hours, so I confronted with him that why he has to spend so much time in a English cram school. And he told me that he have to communicate with the Chinese teacher, so he has to spend the extra hours. So I told him that it just a cram school, why should he spend another hours. At first, I didn’t doubt him. Then I found out that he would answer some calls. And when he answer that phone, he didn’t talk in front of me. He went to the study room to have the phone call. And then I examine his phone, the texts he got, then I found out that there are something wrong.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So… in his phone, did you find anything unusual?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	First, I look up his phone book. Then I found out that there is a same number that calls over and over. And then I found out that the texts he got are all from the same person, the same woman. Then I realize that he and that woman text every single day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even though they are texting, it is alright. It is not a big deal. The context is fine. It’s not horrible, right?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it was a very normal and regular text, it would be fine. But he is a married man, and in the texts, there are some intimate message, and those message I have already filed to the court as the evidence.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	As you can see the exhibit 1, there was the context of the message, and I would like to ask the defendant, are those messages from your cellphone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這是我手機裡的訊息。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	If that’s so, I would like to ask you some questions about these message. The first, I would like to ask the text from the cellphone number 0958932123 on December 21st, 2018. The time was 9:50 p.m. And in the context, it was written, “I really miss you my love.” What did it mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那個簡訊是從我的同事那傳給我的，那時候我請了兩天假，然後他就覺得有點小擔心，然後傳簡訊來關心我一下而已。我的同事是在美國受的教育，所以他才會這麼的開放，那這些說話方式也只是她表達他自己的一些說法，那剛剛提到的那個my love，也就只是我們稱我們關心的人的親暱的名字。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So what you mean is that, the person was educated in the west, so her mind is westernized. And therefore, the way she express her emotion and feelings are more open? And so…the phrase “my love” is not a big deal and didn’t mean anything.

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	是的，那只是我們在比較親密的朋友之間會稱呼彼此的方式而已。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the first part of the message?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我剛剛說的阿，他就只是擔心我而已，因為那時候…我們兩個是工作上的搭檔。所以在我請兩天假的時候，他就是非常的擔心我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So what you mean is that the person…when you are away, she needs your assistance during the teaching, so she sent you the message to express her worries and concerns,. Is that what you mean?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的，那就是這簡訊的意義，所以這封簡訊根本就沒有什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Then, we will examine the second message. It was sent by the same cellphone. And the time was on December 29th, 2017 at 11:55 p.m. It was written, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this text mean? Could you explain?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他寫這個訊息就只是想要問我說，在我的中文文本中要怎麼翻成英文。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you mean is that she sent you the message in order to help you to accomplish your homework? What does it even mean? 

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太剛剛在前面的時候跟法庭告知的，我現在在上一堂就是碩士的課程，那這整個課程有三十個學分，那為了要完成這三十個學分，裡面難免會有些作業跟一些練習，那我當然要完成這些東西。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you first explain what did you major in for your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的主修是在英語教學，那在其中的一些課程安排上，就是有些英語教學的課程沒錯，那來有另一個部分是關於文化以及語言能力的一些課程，那就當然其中有一些...這些東西。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that the field you choose is TESOL, there are some culture and language communication in the course?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我印象中是起碼有三堂課跟文化語言溝通有關的課。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what is the assignment which is related to the cultural and language communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這堂課程的作業在每個學生身上都不太一樣。那以我為例的話，因為我現在在台灣，然後想要取得英文教學的工作，那為了要達成這個目標，那勢必我是一定要有能力去掌握中文。所以我有很多的作業是要怎麼中翻英或是英翻中。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Therefore, in order to fulfill the plan that you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to finish and complete the assignment or translate English into Chinese, or Chinese into English?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，而同時間我也被耀球說我要精進我的口說及寫作的能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay, then we will go back to the texts we have been presenting, so the text was your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，那就是我的作業，那在當時的時候，我拿到句子的時候，我完全不知道要怎麼翻，你也知道，就是中文有些詞彙就是很難翻譯成英文，所以在當時我拿到作業時，我完全不知道該怎麼翻譯，所以我就是向我的同事求助，那我就請他在翻完之後，將翻譯傳簡訊給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Well, according by your claim, that this text message was only the question of your assignment. And the college is only translate the assignment for you and give you the answer. Is that what you claim?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，那個內容只是我功課的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Okay, now the defendant please read the exhibit 1, page 14 to page 16, are all these messages the answers of your assignment for your master degree?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊內容都只是為了要完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Well… what’s your explanation about your wife suspect that you are having an affair with your coworker. What’s your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的是在這件事情上想太多了，我一直知道他一直很不滿意我養家活口的能力，而在我一開始要在去進修，取得碩士學位的時候後，他就完全沒有表現出支持我的舉動或是…沒有任何支持。因為她一直沒有就是表現出任何支持，所以我就沒有想要去問他，或是請他幫我完成這些作業，而我就覺得說，他就是這整個誤解的罪魁禍首。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your explanation, it seems that there are some unhappiness between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在一開始新婚的時候，我們的確過得很愉快，但是就是主要問題就是我的工作，因為在我一開始在這裡教授葡萄牙文，但是一直碰壁又碰到困難，就變成了我們主要的問題。所以就，我的工作就變成我們吵架的問題，我們就時常為了這種問題吵架，然後這整個狀況，造成我非常的沮喪、非常的洩氣、非常的挫折。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, then we’ll go back to your master degree. When did you start your master degree? Do you finish it? And when will you get your diplomat?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2015年的秋天註冊的，就開始這個課程那他預計是兩年的課程，那我應該會是在2017年的五月的時候畢業，但是我一直沒有完成這個學位是因為我一直都有一些兼職工作，所以我就沒有時間去完成我的那些作業。就像我剛剛提到的，就我太太一直都沒有很支持我的這個決定，所以在整個求學過程中我一直覺得很沮喪，而且很累，所以我就還沒有拿到這個學位。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So you just mentioned that this program is designed for 2 years, and you didn’t finish it, so what is the main reason of that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有的課程作業，還有一些課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So when is the last semester you register?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我最後一個學期是在2017年的春天註冊的。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So if it is true, as you just mentioned, that the course has already finish in May, 2017. So it is reasonable that after the course you didn’t have any assignment. But after the semester has ended, during the 7 months you have the text message with your coworker, what’s the purpose.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	就算我沒有完成我的學位，也不代表說我就不要再精進我的語言能力，所以在這個課程結束後，我就還是做一些作業、一些練習，就是我是自學啦，自修這樣子。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that despite you didn’t finish the course, you still want to improve your language competence, so you continue to write this text? 

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，這就是為什麼我會向我的同事求救。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So this coworker you have, she is like tutor, Chinese tutor, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不是我的家教而已，他更是一個很好很好的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	So… do you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我原本說要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why she answers your texts in the middle of the night? Doesn’t it exceed the relationship of being a coworker?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	就是為什麼我會說他是個非常好的朋友，因為他是利用他自己的時間在教我中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still work in the cram school as a English teacher?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的，我還在那邊工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does the coworker still worker there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是的，他還在那邊工作，但我們現在已經不是搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any other witness or other evidence that you wanted to provided to the court or the person you want to subpoena further?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like the court to subpoena the coworker, Rong-er Huang as witness to clarify the evidence of the texts and to clarify and explain the relationship of the defendant and her.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The plaintiff, do you have any other evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I have heard that the cram school trying to fix the relationship with my husband and the coworker, and they’re trying to convince the coworker to leave, to quit the job. So I wanted the court to ask the cram school for further statement or subpoena them as witness.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any other evidence the you want the court to investigate for you. Now the situation is that, because your degree program have already finished in May, 2017, so it cannot be the evidence or explanation for your relationship with your coworker. And most of your message is sent at 9 p.m. Therefore, it is a very suspicious movement or relationship between you and your coworker. Therefore, do you have any other evidence that you can prove that you and your coworker are only the relationship of college or friend to clarify that. Do you have any other evidence to clarify that?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我目前想步道法院可以幫我調查的證據，就像我所說的，我跟我同事之間的關係非常的單純，我們倆之間的訊息就只是為了要增進我的語言能力以及我的中文能力而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court date is set on June 24th, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. as the inquiry of witness, and during the procedure, we will ask both party, the plaintiff and the defendant to explain the situation. If it is necessary, both party can have the layer to attend the court.

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？

zh-TW	是的我了解

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure, and the case is prosecuted by the accuser Yu Han Wang. The incident is caused from the accuser’s husband Edward Papayashi. The defendant, Edward Papayashi… so her husband is prosecuted with a crime of adultery case and her husband Edward Papayashi had sent an intimate message with her co-worker and they had too close reaction. And they often work overtime, and in the late night they had tele-conferencing. And it seems that this relationship is beyond co-worker’s relationship. The defendant, your wife Yu Han Wang think that you have an affair with your co-worker, and you are prosecuted with a crime of adultery. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the judge will mainly ask the defendant and to understand the details and the relationship between the defendant and his co-worker to clarify whether the defendant and his co-worker have affairs and constitute adultery case. Do the both party understand the procedure today?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	the accuser, first I want to ask you, how long have you and your husband been married, and do you have children with your husband?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	Oh, we have been married for four years, and we don’t have children.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Well, so you too got married in Taiwan or in foreign countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	My husband and I met in Taiwan, and four years ago, my husband just came to Taiwan, and he wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the past years, has he taught Portuguese in Taiwan for four years?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he taught Portuguese. And after we got married, he continued teaching Portuguese. However, you know that Portuguese in Taiwan is not a popular language, and it’s not common, so the teaching hours is not stable, and sometimes will even have a period between jobs. And sometimes, the period between jobs could last for one to two months. And because my husband wants to have a stable income, so he wanted to …tended to teach English. And however, his mother tongue is not English, so he sought an advanced degree and want to polish his English.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned your husband wanted to polish his English, and does it mean that he wanted to seek an advanced degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he wanted to seek an advanced degree which is about TESOL. So my husband have a distance learning program, which is provided by… which is taught from California, America, and had a distance learning program. And he only has to learn on distance learning and do not have to come to America. In this way, after all the credits he got from the distance learning program, he can get a master degree and after gets a master degree, he can be an English teacher and teachs English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with in this adultery case?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	My husband and the person he has an affair with is his colleague. Because the distance learning program have an arrangement of both… Chinese and foreign teacher. And in the distance learning program, they are colleague and have to partner with each other.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have affairs and beyond co-worker’s relationship?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	at first, I noticed the strange thing it is because my husband started to work overtime in school and I just wonder my husband just go to learn English and want to seek an advanced degree, and why do you have to work overtime? And he said it is because he had a Chinese teacher, and he had to partner with her, so he has to work in school and communicate with her, so they can learn better. In the beginning, I didn’t suspect he would do the adultery. I started to think strange and it was because after he came back from school, he started to have many different calls, and the more important is that he wouldn’t talk in front of me. Instead, he would go to the study and talked. And because I think it’s strange, so I checked her cellphone and found many messages.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	so, did you find any unusual messages in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In my husband’s phone book, there is always the same phone number, so I found it stranger and I checked his message. I found he always has messages with the same woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	And even though he always has text message with the same woman, does it… why would you think it’s strange? It seems fine. Or did you see any strange message in her cellphone? 

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If the message is just some common words, and I won’t find something strange, and will prosecute adultery case. and it is because the message is very intimate, and just before today’s proceeding, I had provided some of the messages to the judge, and I think all the contents are in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Exhibit evidence1 and page 13: here is the message content that your wife provided to the court, and the defendant you can check whether the message content is true.

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這些是在我手機裡面的簡訊內容。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	well, so I will ask you some details in these messages. And the first message, the time is on December 21st, 2018. And the time is at 9:50 pm. The phone number is 0958932123. This phone number sent a message to your cellphone, and the contents of the message is 我非常想你. So what’s your plea? What’s your reaction to this intimate message?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那是我一個同事傳給我的訊息，那當時我放了兩天假，因為我的同事很擔心，所以他傳了這封訊息給我。我的同事是在美國長大的，所以她是非常心胸寬大的，他講話一直都是這麼直接這樣子如此，那我們兩個在稱呼彼此親近的人的時候，會直接稱我的寶貝、我的愛。我們一直都是用這樣的說詞，所以我並不覺得有任何的不妥。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	so what you mean is that the people who sent the message…because she has stayed in the foreign countries for several years, so her thought is westernized, and she is kind of open-minded. So even she said my love to you don’t have any other special meanings? 

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	哦對啊，這並沒有任何的意義，這只是我們對於親近的朋友，關心的說詞而已，表達我們是好朋友、彼此關心的意思。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	So what about the previous message she just sent to you? I really missed you, this sentence.

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	正如同我剛剛所說過的，那是因為她擔心我，我們彼此是夥伴關係，那當時我請了兩天假，她自然而來會關心我，所以才發了這則訊息給我、表達他的關心。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Well, so you mean that it is just because you had two days off, and do not go to work, and because she is your partner in the distance learning program, without you she has no assistance, so she sent this message to you, it’s that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的，所以這個訊息就是這樣子來的，這並沒有什麼了不起、很特別或是很奇怪的事情。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Let’s move to the exhibit evidence two. The message happened at 11:55pm, on December 29th on 2017. And the message is also sent from the same phone number, and the content is 我想要在你身旁，我們什麼時候才可以再一起呢？ So I want to by your side, and when we can truly be together? So what does it mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	當時她是想學著如何用中文來表達意思，所以她傳了這封訊息給我？

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	so you mean that she, your colleague, sent this message to you, and the purpose is to help you do the homework. So what does it mean, I don’t really know…I don’t really get you.

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	當我老婆有起訴我們通姦這件事的時候，我正在修遠距課程，並想要得到碩士學位，在這個課程當中，我需要修30學分。那自然地，為了完成這30個學分，我必須完成一些作業跟練習，那我的夥伴就協助我完成這些作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	I want to ask…so what do you really study in your master program? I don’t understand, can you explain to me?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是關於英語教學。那裡面就有關於英語教學、以及文化相關以及語言能力的培訓。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So what you mean is that the TESOL that you studied in your master program, and in the master program, it contains some of courses about culture and communication, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，然後我記得在這個碩士學位當中，有三堂課是關於文化以及溝通的課程。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So the courses about culture and communication, what’s the common assignment that the teacher will assign you? 

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	在這些文化課程當中，每個人的作業都會依照每個人在讀這個碩士學位的目的而有改變。那像我呢，我在讀這個碩士學位，是想要得到之後能在台灣教英文，因此我必須要展現我對中文有優秀的掌握能力。也是因為這樣，所以我的作業很多都是關於中文跟英文句子的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So you mean that because you plan to teach English in Taiwan, and you have to show that you has a good command of Chinese, so in order to complete your assignment, you have to translate the English sentence into Chinese, is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，此外我還需要去磨練我的口說以及寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So, let’s move back to the exhibit evidence two, the message. Do you mean that this message is one of your assignments?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，這就是我當時的作業，我記得當初我看到這句話中文的時候，其實我並不了解它的意思，畢竟中文很多用字對外國人來說是很難了解的，因為我不懂，所以我去找我的partner幫忙，請他幫忙把這句話翻成英文，再把答案傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Well, so that sentence, I want to by your side, kind of this sentence, is the situation just you wanted her to translate the Chinese sentence, and at that time, you asked her to send the correct answer to you. So it’s the total situation at that time?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	是的，那句話就只是我作業的解答而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	The defendant, let’s move to the exhibit evidence one, page 14 to16. Please… so now you can browse all the messages in this evidence, so you mean that all the messages are part of your assignments?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯，這些訊息都是為了完成作業，才有這些訊息。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	and your wife just said that you and your colleague have the adultery, and what do you want to explain?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	關於外遇這件事，我覺得一直以來都是我老婆想太多。我知道我在這個家庭中，我其實沒辦法支撐家庭的很多重擔，不過在這個課程當中，我的太太就也沒有…從我的課程開始到現在，我的妻子也沒有給我任何的協助。在我上碩士課程當中，我太太一直都不願意來協助我完成任何作業，要不是他這樣子不支持我，我也不需要請求我的中文夥伴來協助我，所以我覺得現在發生的一切，都不能怪到我頭上。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, it seems that you and your wife have something unhappy and do not get along well with your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們剛結婚的時候，我們確實過得很幸福、也很開心，但是呢後來的問題就開始出現了，因為我在台灣教的是葡萄牙文，那工作的時數不穩定，也沒辦法帶來穩定的收入，所以我們就開始出現了狀況。在此之後，我們針對就業工作這件事情，我們時不時的在爭吵同件事，她並不相信我的努力跟堅持，我也不知道如何讓他了解我所面對的挫折跟困難之處。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Well, let’s move back to your master program. Until now, do you still study in the master program? And when will you get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2016年四月開始讀這個碩士學位，那照理來說這個課程需要兩年，那原則上我應該在2017年五月完成。因為我一直沒有穩定的工作，所以沒有足夠時間唸書，所以我後來就放棄這個學位。正如我剛剛所說的，在我讀碩士學位的過程中，我的太太完全沒有支持我，我在讀書過程完全都是靠我自己，過程中我覺得很疲累、很挫折，我不知道該怎麼辦。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	you just mentioned the degree program… the period is two years, and you don’t complete the program, and I want to know the reason that you failed the program.

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有在課程上要求的作業，還有其中一些課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	so in the last semester that you registered, and when did the semester end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我在學註冊的最後一個學期，最後是在2017年春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If all the things are just as you stated, the course should be end at May, 2017. And after you finished and stopped the program, you wouldn’t have any assignments. However, you still had text messages with your colleague after the course ends, and the period is for seven months, and what’s your explanation?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	雖然我沒辦法完成我的碩士學位，但不代表我不想要改善我的中文能力，因此在我結束這個課程之後，我就靠自己想要改善我的中摁能力。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean even though you didn’t finish the master program, you still wants to improve your Chinese, and wants your Chinese become influent, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，這就是為什麼我找我的女同事幫忙我。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	so, … your colleague kind of plays the role of your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	對我來說，她所扮演的角色並不單單只是家教，更是我的好朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	And did you pay money to your colleague for her teaching?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我有說想付她錢，可是她沒有接受

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If she is not your tutor, and you do not pay her money, why did she work so hard, and at midnight, is the time that she go to bed, she still sent the messages to you. And the content of the message seems to beyond the co-worker’s relationship.

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這就是我為什麼說她真的是我很好的朋友，他都會在空閑時間幫助我，協助我精進中文能力

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Did you still teach English in the school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的我現在還在那邊工作

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	And this colleague is still work in the school now?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是的，她現在也在那個地方工作，不過我們現在不是同事關係，也沒有一起合作到。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	rosecutor, do you need to subpoena anyone that can help you investigate the case or investigate any evidence?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena the defendant’s colleague, Rong Er Huang. And I want her to act as an witness and help the court to clarify all situations and all the background and the purposes of these messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, do you want the prosecutor investigate any evidence for you?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard the cram school they worked in,… I heard that the cram school just took some action, and they intended to persuade the colleague Huang Rong Er to quit the job. So I want to confirm with the cram school and clarify the situation.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you want the court to investigate for you any further evidence? The current situation is that you have finished your master program in May, 2017. There is no reason that you make up reasons for finishing the assignments and sent messages with your colleague Huang Rong Er. And especially the time you two sent messages is almost after 9pm, it’s very possible for people to think there is a strange relationship between you and do you have any evidence that can help you clarify all the situation in this case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我實在想不到任何可以就我的立場幫我調查的事情。就如同我剛才所說，我們傳訊息這件事情非常簡單，只是單純我想要增進我的中文能力，然後我想要把中文學習的更好。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next proceeding is set to held at 4:30pm on June 24th, in 2018. We will subpoena the witness, Huang Rong Er, and ask her. And the both party have the right to a lawyer. Do the both party understand all the procedure in this case?

zh-TW	 我明白。

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor please stat the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same by the file.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the…adultery case. The defendant wife accuse his husband Takayashi, for he find the intimate message in his husband’s cellphone. And his husband often find reasons for extra work, and moreover have the tele-conference with his co-workers, which is beyond the co-worker relationship. The defendant, your wife suspect you have an affair with other woman, what’s your plead?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然無罪。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today procedure, we are going to see the detail of the defendant and his co-worker’s message to see whether they have an affair that beyond the co-worker relationship.

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	The accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	Me and my husband have been married for 4 years. We didn’t have any children. 

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Where did you get married? In Taiwan? Or in your husband’s country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met in Taiwan 4 years ago. He came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in a period between his jobs, is his job teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he is a Portuguese teacher, and after we get married, he still teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so it is not stable in his teaching hours. There is a great period between his jobs for 1 or 2 months. After a while, he seeks for a stable job, so he tried to teach English. However, English is not his mother tongue, so he seek for an advance degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mention that he seek for an advance degree. Do you mean that is a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Because he want to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he need is an English teaching degree. He found a distance learning program in California. In that, he can have a distance learning in Taiwan, and he didn’t need to go to the America. After program, he can have the master degree, and he can teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship with he and his affair person?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They were co-workers in his cram-school. They are partnered with my husband.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know that they are having an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I just notice that my husband often find reason for extra works in the school. And I don’t know why- it is a school and he need to have extra work….At the begging, I didn’t suspect him. However, in a few time, I found he will have phone call in the house, and when he responses the phone call, he will get into the study room. So I tried to check his phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you see something strange in his phone

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I found a phone in his phone book. So I check the message about that phone call, and I found there are many intimate messages.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even is the text it is okay…is the text no appropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it is the regular text, that okay. But he is married, why a married person have intimate messages with other woman in his phone? I have some evidence in the file of the court. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Exhibition 1 page 13, is this message from your phone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的這些是在我手機裡的訊息。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	I would like to ask some question about this message. The first message was sent by number 0958-532123 on 9:50 p.m. December 21, 2017. It is the “ I really miss you, my love.” What that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那封簡訊是我同事寄給我的，我記得當時我請了2天的假，所以他才發那一的簡訊給我，我的同事在美國讀書的所以思想比較開放，至於親愛的這個詞只是我們表達對朋友的稱呼。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the person who send the message was studied in foreign, so she has westernized and express her emotion open mind. So the word she send ‘my love’ didn’t mean nothing?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	是的，那只是對她所關心的人都有的稱呼。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	Then what about the previous one?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我所說的，她只是很關心我而已，因為我當時請了2天的假，而我們是互相之間的夥伴。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you meant that she sent the message because you just didn’t go to school for two days?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	對的就是那個意思，那簡訊沒什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent on the 11:55, December 29th 2017, the context is “I want you to be my side, when can we be truly together?’ What’s that mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳那簡訊給我是為了要告訴我要如何在中文句子中表達自己的情感。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So do you mean that she sent this message to help you with your homework? What was that meant?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我妻子所報告的，我正在攻讀一個碩士學位，而這個課程需要完成30學分，所以我自然會想要在平時所做練習。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain what’s your master degree study for?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是英語教學，它其中最主要包含了語文教學，那它也有部分是包含了文化以及語言能力的部分。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So your program is a TESOL but it is include some cultural and language competence course?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得我至少選修了3門有關於跨文化溝通的課程。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what’s the assignment of these cultural courses? 

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這些文化溝通的課程作業對每個人都不太一樣，以我為例，因為我在台灣，所以我的課程作業的目標是需要增進我的中文語言能力。因此我的作業多半是中英句子的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So do you meant that those assignment for translate sentences in Chinese and English….have relationship with your tend teaching English in Taiwan?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	沒錯，當然我也被要求了增進我的口說以及寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Then let’s focus on the sentence we mentioned. Is that your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的我記得當時我還不太理解一些中文句子的翻譯，所以我向我的同事請求幫忙，我把中文句子傳給她並希望她把它翻譯成英文句子給我看。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Do you meant that she sent that message because you ask her for translate it in English, and that message was the answer of your homework?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	沒錯那封簡訊只是我作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	That’s start in exhibition 1, page 14 to 16. Is all this message is for your assignment? I mean all the content of this message the answer of your homework?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對的這些簡訊都來自幫我完成作業的人。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then what’s your plead for you have an affair with the other woman.

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太只是想太多了，我知道她對我目前分擔家計的能力不太滿意，而我也希望法院知道她從一開始就不太支持我攻讀這個碩士學位。她也不太願意對我的課程上有所幫助，所以我才只好找我的同事完成這些作業，所以我認為她應該為這件事情負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your explanation, you don’t have a happy marriage life between you and your wife? 

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	一開始我們相處得很愉快，但之後因為我的工作關係，因為我教葡萄牙文的關係，所以在台灣不太有穩定的工作時間，因此我的工作常常成了我們的爭吵議題，她不認為我真的盡了我的全力了而我也因此常常很受挫。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay. Let’s go back to your program of your master degree. When did it start? Did you finish your program?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2015年的秋天開始我的碩士課程的，這課程本來應該是要在2017年的5月結束的，但我沒有完成它，因為我必須在工作及學位間做選擇，而這碩士學位影響了我的工作。就像我說的，我妻子從來就不支持我，而我感到很孤獨很沮喪；來攻讀這個學位，因此我覺得我非常的疲倦。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mention that the program is set for 2 years. Why didn’t you finish that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成那些課堂作業，以及一些課程的必修。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So what is the last semester of your registration? 

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我最後註冊的一個學期是2017年的春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As your mention, your program is finished on May 2017. However, you continual connect with your co-worker. How did you explain that you have the assignment after you finished the program?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	或許我沒完成那個學位，但這不代表說我不想精進我的中文能力，我依然非常想增進我的中文能力，因此我找同事來做這些練習。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even if didn’t finish that program, you still want to learn Chinese by yourself?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	沒錯，那就是我找我同事幫忙的原因。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the role of your colleague, co-worker is like your tutor, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是個家教，而是我真心的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我原本想要的，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you did not pay, why she response your answer in midnight when she is going to sleep? Is this relationship beyond your co-worker’s relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	就像我所說的，她是位非常支持我的朋友

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teaching English in that school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的我還在那邊工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is this colleague still works there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	null

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any person you want to ask, or some exhibition you want to show?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena his colleague, 蓉兒黃, who works in 美而美 school. For the investigate the details, and background of those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Accuser, did you need anything ant to investigate for?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the美而美school have took some action for my husband and蓉兒黃for their relationship. And I would like to hear the explanation of the school. 

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The situation now is your program has ended in May 2017, and you don’t have any reason to contact with your colleague in December. And your message often sent in 9 p.m. It is weird for your relationship.

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我並沒有任何法院需要調查的證據，就像我所說的，這些簡訊都只是我想用來增進中文能力的方法而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The court will have ask the details 4:30 p.m. June 24 2017…..

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白了。

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	了解

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	The prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the letter of indictment

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for an adultery case. The accuser’s name is Yu Han Wang. She accuses Edward who were in a cram school…She accuses because Edward not only has intimate message with his coworkers, but also find some reasons for working late in the cram school, also will have some tele-conferencing that is beyond their relationship of the coworkers. So, the accuser Yu Han Wang accuses Edward for adultery. The defendant, your wife sued you for adultery, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparation procedure, the court will focus on the intimate message and his coworkers. To understand whether it consists…constitute adultery case. Do you fully understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First I want to ask the accuser, how many years have you and your husband married? Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have married for four years and we have none child.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	And did you married with your husband in Taiwan or at the broad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan for years ago. He came here to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the past four years, your husband’s job in Taiwan is teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	Before we met, he was a Portuguese teacher and after we married he is still teaching Portuguese. However, learning Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan so there are one or two months period between jobs that he didn’t have student to teach. In order to make the income more stable, he wants to learn English. However English is not his mother tongue so he spent more time on this language and study it… and seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You have mentioned he decided to seek an advanced degree, is that mean he wants to study a degree in Taiwan? 

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, he wants to teach English in Taiwan so the degree he gets is about the English teaching. He found an online learning which was located in the California USA, so he can use this distance learning to finish his degree. So after that he finished online-leaning he can get the master degree of the USA. He can find a job to teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship between the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	The cram school will have a Chinese teacher and a Western teacher and my husband and that girl are partners

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have an affair with each other?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, he often work late, so I asked him why did you have to work late in an English cram school? He replied that he has a Chinese partner and they have to communicate with each other to talk about their teaching. At first I have no doubt about him, but ….for the time goes…after he went home he will get some phones and he will not answer the phone in front of me, but instead he will go to the study room. After that I checked his cellphone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	What did you see in the cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	After I checked his cellphone, I found that there is a same number in the phone book, so after that I checked his message and found that he send message with same woman almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even they text with each other…it’s fine? Or the content is not proper?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	I also want it is not an appropriate text, but he was married but still send some intimate messages with that woman. I have provided some investigation messages in the file, maybe there are in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Let’s look at the investigation page 13. It’s about the message. The defendant, please look at the message. Are the messages you send to others?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是地這些是我手機上的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	And I want to ask some questions about the messages. The first message is sent at 9:50 on December twenty-first 2017, from the phone number 0958932123 to your cellphone. And the content of message is “I really miss you”. So what is this mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那封簡訊是我同事傳來的，那時候正好請…兩天沒有去上班，她是關心我，所以才傳這封簡訊，我的同事在美國受高等教育，她也是非常能接受新思想的人，至於說”my love”我的摯愛這個詞的話，是一種對關心的人表達的方式而已。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So what you mean is that your college is educated so she was westernized…so her…so…she will be more open-minded toward relationship. So “my dear love” is just a kind of concerning about you?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	那句話就是對老朋友表達關心的方式

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	So how about the line?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就如同上面所述，她當時是非常擔心我，因為我們是工作上夥伴關係，她只是想要表達她的關心而已

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Since you have two days off the work, so she text you for…missing you to work each other and cooperate with each other and work, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	對~那就是我想表達的意思，簡訊內其實沒甚麼大不了的

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was at 11:55 at night. It is on December 29th ,2017. And it is from the same cellphone… number of the cellphone. The message is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” So what’s this mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳這封簡訊是要教我如何…用中文來表達…中文的一個作業

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you have mentioned that she texts you this message is just to help you with this assignment? What’s this mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我老婆在庭前所說，碩士學位是需要修滿30學分，除此之外還需要完成許多作業與題目

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	 So would you please explain first, what’s the content of your master degree? What did you learn in it?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我是先英語教學的碩士學位，她除了包含英語教學以外，還有關文化、有些語文能力的訓練

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So you have achieved the master degree of TESOL… and your leaning has included the cross-cultural communication, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得三門課是有關文化與溝通的

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what’s the assignment of the course of culture and communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這門課的作業是因人而異的，舉一個例子，像我在台灣想成為英文老師，我是要展現對中文的能力，所以我的作業是以中英翻譯為主。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you have to approve your Chinese ability. Due to the assignment, you have to translate many sentences into Chinese? Right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，除此之外還需要潤飾口說與寫作能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to the context of the message. You said it’s your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，那是我作業的一部分，中文有許多困難的字，對初學外國人來講，所以我請求同事幫我翻譯再把答案傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So what you have said is that you asked your colleges to translate sentences so she translated into then sended to you. Is this the situation at that time?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	簡訊的內容就只是我作業中的部分而已

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	So let’s look at page 14 to 16 about the investigation. The defendant, so know you can see all the messages. Are they all for the assignments? Is that right?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的這些簡訊都是為了尋求幫忙的內容

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So what’s your plea about your wife cused you having affair with colleague?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	對我認為我太太是想太多的，我也知道她可能認為我，對於支持這個機庭並不是那麼盡責，但當時我在完成碩士學位期間她也沒有給予任何幫助，因為她之前沒有給予任何幫助，所以我才會去尋求同事的幫忙，而她也要為此負責任…為這次的誤會負責任

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your explanation, you have not a very good relationship with your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們開始的婚姻其實還蠻美好的，後來變質的原因為我工作的緣故，我是教葡萄牙，但是工作並不是那麼穩定，後來由於工作的議題有許多的爭吵，她認為我沒有盡力…對於工作沒有盡力而為，但我其實有許多挫折與苦衷是沒有說出來的。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	So let’s go back to your master degree. When is your master degree? Has it ended? Have you gotten the master degree yet?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	這個碩士課程是在2015四月開始的，為期兩年，應該要在2017年的五月結束，然而我沒有完成碩士學位，因為當時兼職了…做了很多打工而沒有完成作業，就像我說的，我太太在碩士學位研習沒有給予任何的幫助，所以我覺得我是獨自一人奮鬥，奮鬥道非常的淚雨很大的挫折感。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You have mentioned the degree lasted for two years, and you didn’t finished, why is that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成所有的作業，還有課堂上的特定要求

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	When was your last semester of your last registration? 

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我註冊最後一學期是2017年春天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you have mentioned, your last semester of course ended at 2017, so it is no reason that you’ll have assignment after the semester, and your colleagues still send you the translation of the assignment seven months after your last semester?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	並不是我沒有完成學位就代表我不想精進中文的能力，在課程之後我仍然自學中文。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So what you mean is that even you didn’t get master degree, you still want to approve your Chinese ability, so you continue learning, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，這就是我請同事幫助我的原因

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleagues played a role like a tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教也是非常好的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay for her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	原本想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	So if you did not pay her the salaries，why did she have to send you messages at midnight? And this behavior is beyond co-worker’s relationship.

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這就是我之前說她是非常持我的朋友，她花費自己的時間讓我英文更好

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Did you teach English at that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的我還是在那邊教書

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is this colleagues work there also?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	她還在那邊工作，但我們已經不是合作得關係

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have to…any person to subpoena or investigate any…

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena the colleagues of named Ron Er Huang and as a witness to tell the court what’s the purpose of the texts and explain the texts as well.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Accuser, do you have anything to investigate, the court may help you?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has put some actions about the relationship between two people, and also persuade the person to resign her job. So I want to investigate this evidence to prove it’s right or not.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have anything to investigate the court may help you? As your master degree ended at 2016, so that’s an excuse of your interaction with your colleagues, by sending texts mostly after nine pm, that is doubtable… Do you want to provide any evidence to prove that…your…you are not guilty. 

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	對於庭上，我沒有想要庭上調查的事項，我們的關係真的是…很一般，我只是想要增進中文能力，並持續學中文而已

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court is set at 16:30 on April, June 22nd 2018, for asking the witness of the procedure. And all of you, the defendant, the accuser have to participate the court and you can hire a lawyer. Do you fully understand?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我知道我了解

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor please describe the fact of the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	As stated on the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the adultery case. The defendant’s wife Yu-Hen Wang is intend to accuse his..her husband because she finds in her husband cell phone that there were some intimate messages with her…his coworker. And that the accuser finds that her husband often come back home late from work, contacting with his coworker during midnight and the content of the conversation has gone beyond merely coworker relationship. The defendant, your wife has suspected that you have commit the crime of adultery. What is your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯，當然

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, we are going to ask the defendant the detail of his conversation with his coworker. So that we could determine  whether the defendant has committed the crime of adultery.

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, the accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have any kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	Me and my husband have been married for 4 years. We do not have any children.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Does you… do you marry with your husband in Taiwan? Or do you marry with your husband in foreign country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met 4 years age in Taiwan. He came to Taiwan primarily for teaching Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the previous years, his main job is teaching Portuguese, right?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, after we got married, he is still teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan. There are not many students waiting to learn Portuguese. So, his teaching hours is not that stable. Sometimes he wouldn’t have any classes for 1 or 2 months. After a while, he hoped that he could have a stable income. So he would like to teach English. However, English is not her native language. So he decides to go on further education and seeks for an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned he would like to seek for an advanced degree. Do you mean that he would like to study a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he would like to teach English in Taiwan, so he would need to have a TESOL degree. He found a distanced learning program in California, so he do not have to go to United States to earn a degree. After the online program, he could receive a master degree and he planned that after earning the degree, he could find a teaching job in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then, what’s his relationship with this so-called adultery…adultery person?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They were colleague in cram school. Because in that cram school, they offer teacher both in Chinese and foreign country. They are partners. 

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know that they are committing adultery?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I discoverer that my husband start to work late and I ask him why he work late so often. It’s merely a cram school. He said that because he has to partner with the Chinese teacher, there are a lot of issues for them to communicate about. In the beginning, I don’t have any doubts on him. However, after a while, I discovered that when he arrived home, there are a lot of phone calls. And he always receive the phone calls in a private space such as his study room. And do not want me to know what he is talking about. So that I begin to suspect him.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So, do you see any unusual messages in the phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	There is a phone number that keep coming up all the time in his dialing record. And then I check his message box, I discovered that he has been messaging with the same girl all the time.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even is just texting… text message, it’s nothing. Are the text content inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it’s just regular texting, how come the text message is so intimate? Why a married person would text like that? I have submitted the text log to the court. I believe the contents are already in the folder.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Present Exhibit 1 page 13. The defendant, is this the message in your phone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這些是在我手機裡的訊息。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Then, I would like to ask some questions regarding these messages. The first message come from 9:50 P.M. 12/21, 2017 from the phone number 0958932123. The content of the message is “I really miss you, my love.” What does that even mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那封簡訊是我同事傳給我的。我記得那時我請了兩天的假，因為她有點擔心，才傳了那樣的簡訊，我的同事在美國受教育，他思想比較開放，而至於”親愛的”這個詞呢，只是我們表達我們對於我們關心的人的一種方法。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because your coworker is more westernize so that she is more open-minded so that she expressed her emotion in that way. The word “my love” does not have any special meaning. 

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	對的，這是好朋友之間或者是對關心的人所表達的一種方法。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	Then, what about the previous sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，他只是比較擔心我而已，因為我當時請了兩天的假，而我們也是工作中非常要好的同事。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because you just took two day off and that she express her concern to you on the work?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	對的，那就是情境。這個簡訊沒有什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message came from 11:55 P.M. 12/29 2017 from the same message, same cell phone, with the same number. The content is “ I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What was that mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他傳這個簡訊是告訴我如何用中文表達這樣的訊息。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you mean that she sent this message is to help you with your own assignment. What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	正如我妻子所提到的，我正在修讀碩士學位，這個課程需要我完成30個學分，那麼當然的，這其中就包含了一些作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you please explain what your master degree is about?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程主要是跟英語教學有關，其中包含了語文教學還有部分是跟文化以及語言能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So, you are study for TESOL program, and that the program constituted with some culture related courses?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得我至少是有三門課是和跨文化及溝通有關的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What are the assignment for these so-called culture and communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這些文化溝通的課程的作業會依個人而定，像比方說，因為我在台灣所以我的課程會需要我能擁有良好的中文能力。因此，我的課程有很多跟作業有很多是關於中文英文句子之間的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that your course require you to have some Chinese ability so that you have the assignment of translating Chinese and English. Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，沒有錯，當然，我也被要求要有精進我的口說以及聽力還有寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Then, let’s go back to that sentence. You say this is your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的沒有錯。那個句子是我的作業。我記得我當時還不斷的理解一些中文字句的翻譯，所以我向我的同事請教。畢竟中文和英文的結構以及字非常不一樣。我把中文的句子傳給他，並且希望他能幫我把這個句子翻譯成英文。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So do you...did you mean that you send the Chinese sentence to your coworker and the coworker help you translate it in English and send it to you? So the message is just only for homework. Is that right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	是的，那個訊息僅僅是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Ok. Then let’s go to Exhibit one, page fourteen to sixteen. So, are these all messages for your homework? Please take a look.

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些所有簡訊都是為了幫助我完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then, what’s your explanation toward your wife’s claim of you having an affair?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我的太太只是想太多了，我知道他對我不能協助分擔家計感到不滿。而我希望法院可以知道，他從一開始就不支持我工讀我的碩士學位。因為他不支持我，所以我才必須問我同事這些課程上的問題。所以我覺得，這個整起誤會的責任在他身上而不是我。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, there are some issue between your relationship with your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	一開始我們相處得非常好，但之後因為我的工作遇到了一些問題，在台灣葡萄牙語的教學時間並不是非常穩定。因此我們的工作造成了我們之間一些爭吵的原因。他不認為我有付出足夠的努力來找工作。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	OK. Let’s go back to your master degree program. So do you finish the program? Have you received the degree yet?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2015年的秋天開始了這個課程。這個課程為時兩年，我應該在2017年的五月取得了我的學位，但是我並沒有完成我的學位。因為我必須時常做兼職工作。因此這影響了我的我的讀書時間。就像我說的，我妻子並不支持我攻讀這個學位，我只能孤身一人的攻讀個學位，漸漸的我感到非常的勞累及挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mentioned that the program is for two yearlong but you did not finish the program. Why...why did you do not complete your program

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成所有的課堂作業以及一些課程的畢業要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So what… What’s your last registration date?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我最後註冊的時間是2017年春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you stated, the last...the program finish on May 2017; however, you continue have texted message with your coworker. What do you explain that?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我結束了我的課程，並不代表我放棄精進我的中文能力，我仍然非常想精進我的中文能力，所以我才持續的傳送這些訊息。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	Are you saying that even you did not finish the program, you still want to enhance your Chinese ability?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，因此我才會尋求我同事的協助。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the role of your colleague is like your tutor, correct?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不僅僅是我的家教，而且還是我一個好朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我原本想要付錢給他，但是他拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you did not pay her, then how come she reply your message in the middle of night? Does that has formed a relationship beyond merely coworker?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說他是一個非常支持我的朋友，他用他自己的時間來協助我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still teaching in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的我仍然在那裏工作

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does this colleague still working there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是的她仍然在那裏工作，但我們不再是工作上的搭檔

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any evidence would like to investigate or would like to summon any other witness?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope that we could summon the defendant’s colleague 蓉兒黃 to understand what’s her relationship with the defendant, and the content of the message.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, do you have any other evidence that you would like the court to help you investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has taken some actions between the relationships of my husband and 蓉兒黃. They even ask 蓉兒華 to leave her job. I would like the court to help me investigate whether this is true or not.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence that would like the court to help you investigate to? The situation now is that you have finished your master program in May 2017. So that it is highly unlikely that you ask your colleague to help you with your assignment. And also the text message were sent during midnight, this raise suspicious… a suspicion on your relationship with your coworker.

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我並沒有任何證據希望法庭為我調查，就如我所說的，我和我的同事只是好朋友，這些簡訊只是我為了精進我的中文所傳送。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next proceeding is set on June 24th 2018 4:30 P.M. The defendant and the accuser must come to the court. And if necessary, the defendant and the accuser could bring their own lawyer to the court. Do you understand?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	Today, I am here as an interpreter of the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. Case Number 2345.

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯______，中華民國107年5月21日。」

en-US	Now I will read through your right.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your right?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是，我瞭解了

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory case of an adultery case. The accuser, Wang Yu Han. She filed the sue against the defendant, Edward Takayashi. The defendant was charged with having an intimate message with his employee in the cram school. And the accuser also found some intimate message through his cellphone while the defendant was having a night shift and also have a video tele-conferencing with ZonER- Huang. The defendant, you are charged by your wife of an adultery, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然無罪啊

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory case, we are here to discuss….talk about the detail about the defendant and his employee of the…. We are having to discuss the.. whether the person has an affair with the others. Do you two understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是我瞭解了.

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, the accuser, do you have the child with your husband?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have married for four years. But we don’t have the child.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	So, did you marry your husband in Taiwan, or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese. 

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in the past years, does your husband teach Portuguese as his work?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we met the first time, he was a Portuguese teacher. And he has keep teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese isn’t a popular language in Taiwan, and…so the teaching hours are usually short, and there are periods between jobs. In order to earn a stable living, he started to learn English in Taiwan, since his mother tongue isn’t English, so he choose to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that he wants to earn a degree in Taiwan? And get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wants to teach English. So the degree he gets is to …for English teaching. My husband found…that..found a distance learning program in California, it’s an online learning, he doesn’t need to go to there for learning. After he gets all the credits, then he can get a master degree. What he is planning is to have an American degree, so that he can has a qualification for English teaching in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So, what the relationship between the person he has an affair with this time?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are the co-workers in the cram school, there will be a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher, so they can cooperate with each other in the… in class. The person he has an affair with was a Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I was suspecting and ask him why he had to have a night shift after the school? Because it’s just an American cram school, and he has to cooperate with the Chinese teacher, so they had to have the further communication on teaching. At first, I didn’t suspect that… anything about him, but ….when he was having a phone call in….at home, he wouldn’t talk in front me, but he choose to talk through the phone in his… study room….instead.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So did you found anything strange in his cellphone? 

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	And I checked through his phone book, and I saw there was a same number, then I checked his phone message, and I found that he was messaging with a girl he chatted every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even though…. It was a…. Even though, texting messages is not..doesn’t have anything wrong or are there any something weird during the communication?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	So it’s just a regular message, but however there are..they have some intimate messages between each other, and I have files some intimate messages to the court. Maybe it’s inside the file already. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please show the exhibit 1 of Page 13. The defendant, please see the content, are these the one on your phone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這是我手機裡的訊息內容。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Then, I will ask you some questions with these messages. The first message, it was sent at 9:50, December 21st, 2017, the phone number was 0958932123. It was sent to your… the message was sent to your cellphone, and it was written “I really miss you very much”, 我非常想念妳。….親愛的，我非常想念妳。 what does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那是我同事…我同事發給我的，那天我請兩天的假，那是我朋友非常緊張有焦慮的事情。那是我…她是在美國接受教育的，所以她是一個非常開放，然後她思想開放，很勇於表達她自己想法的人，那封訊息內容，I really miss you so much, my love. 那只是她.. 我們互相表達關愛的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the girl was educated in foreign country? So she is westernized, and what she expressed is open-minded, and the message” I really miss you so much” is how she expressed her care?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	對阿。那是朋友之間表達關心的方式。或是更好朋友之間互相表達的關心

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	So how about the previous message?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，她是來….她是傳簡訊來問我東西。我那天請兩天假，所以她有點想念我

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So you mean that …since you have seem just drop two days from your work, and she messaged you that she really missed you a lot. Which means she wanted you a help for her, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的，這就是那個..這內容所要表達的。那並沒有什麼。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent at 23:55. December 29th, 2017. And it was sent by the same person. The message was written” 我想要你在我旁邊，我們什麼時候可以在一起？” What does that mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳的那則簡訊，是要問我說要怎麼在中文怎麼表達豐富的情感。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you mean that she sent you the message just for…just asking help with her work?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我之前跟法庭所說的，我現在有那個碩士學位要修，而且有30學分去完成這個學位。正常來說，我有功課，我一定有功課要做，所以這就是我當時我要所提問的問題

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you further explain, what are you studying in your Master program?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程是屬於英語教學，除了英語的教學之外，還有那個…文化上跟語言能力的課程。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you are getting a mater degree for TESOL, and there are some cultural communication inside the course right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得有至少三門課程是有關文化溝通的課程。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what are the assignments for the cultural and communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	文化溝通不只是就是增加我的經驗之外，還有爭取教學的工作在台灣，除了當一個老師要有一個目標之外，還要一個有語言能力在中文上。所以我的作業有很多是有關中英上的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you want to…you plan to teach English in Taiwan, but you have to get a master degree, and there are courses about Chinese. So the assignments you are assigned are translating the sentences right? In Chinese and English right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	沒錯，我同時還要精進我的口說跟寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So that go back to the words, are these your assignments?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對的。那的確是我的，我之前在學中文所翻譯到的句子。你知道吧，對外國人來說，有些中文句子的確很難分辨。那剛好那個句子我就請我同事翻成中文給我看….請她翻成英文給我看。然後再請她傳送我過來。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So you mean that ask your colleague to send the message into English to you. And those sentences of messages in English was just your assignments?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那句話就只是我作業中的一個中文。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	So the defendant, please see the Exhibit 1, P.14-16. As we see the message context Are these all context were the assignments was for seeking help with your homework?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的。這些都是我要拿來做功課做作業用的

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So, what’s your explanation about the… about your wife filing the sue against you for…you are having an affair with other?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得太太真的有點對此太焦慮了。我知道她其實並沒有對我感到對我照顧這個家庭感到很滿意，從我一開始要唸碩士學位的時候，她就沒有支持我。如果在她一開始支持我的攻讀進修的話，我就不需要尋求我同事的幫忙了。所以她應該要為這一整件的誤會付起最大的責任吧。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your words, there seem to be some dis….between your both?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	一開始我跟我太太結婚其實相處蠻愉快的，但問題出現在我要開始找工作，因為我當時要教葡萄牙文，但是我並沒有辦法拿到任何授課時數。所以因為這樣子我已經跟我太太吵了很多次了。她就是不相信我在這教學上做的努力，她也不知道我其實在教學上面臨了許多的挫折。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s go back to your master course. Are you finish with your courses, or still keep going?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我從2015年的秋天開始進行我兩年制的課程。原計畫是訂定在 2017年五月完成我碩士學位。但是因為我的打工因素，還有我作業沒有辦法完成。所以我就沒有拿到碩士學位。就像我說的，我太太並沒有支持我，我感覺像我自己一個人在追求這個學位，我真的感到很累也感到非常的挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean that the courses was for two-year program, but you didn’t finish. Why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成所有課程的功課。那還有一些課程的必修我也沒有辦法完成。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So, what is your finish date for the registering your…courses?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我註冊在學的最後一個學期是在2017春天的時候。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	Like you said, you should finish your courses on May, 2017. And there will be no assignments for your courses. However, you have been texting messages with your colleagues for seven months after you finish your courses.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	就算我今天沒有完成我的課程。我還是想要增加我的…精進我的中文能力。所以我就還是有持續自己在自學，然後就都會詢問有中文上的困

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that even though you didn’t finish your Chinese courses, you still want to enhance your Chinese ability, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，這就是為什麼我尋求我同事的幫忙

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleague is just like a tutor teaching you?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，也是我真心地朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay for her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有耶，我本來想要付錢給她但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why did she texting you during the midnight, and it’s not the right time, isn’t that beyond the co-worker’s relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	所以我才說她真的是我的好朋友。她都利用她所有的花時間來幫助我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school？

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的，我還在那裡工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does the colleague still working with you in that cram school?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	她還是在那裡工作，但我們並沒有再合作了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have anyone to subpoena, or anything to subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena the witness which means the colleague… the defendant’s colleague to the court. I want her to be the witness of the background and the message, and explain the context

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, do you want the court to help you subpoena anyone?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the Mei-Er-Mei Cram School has taken some actions, one of these is to let Zong-Er Huang to get off …. to leave her work. I would like to subpoena the principle for the… to respond this message.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you want the court to help you investigate any evidence? The defendant, your master courses have ended in May, 2017. However, the action between you and your colleague is beyond co-worker’s relationship. And it’s weird that to text the messages after 9:00 p.m. just for asking for the….having with the assignments, do you have any evidence to…for the court to investigate? And verify your suspicion?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	基本上，我沒有要法院再進一步調查的證據了。我跟我同事真的就是單純之間的朋友互動。我就只是想要增進我的中文而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So the next proceeding will be set on June 24th, 2018. The time is 4:30p.m. We are going to have a witness questioning procedure. For both parties, you have to be here, and you can have your own lawyers. Do you understand?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	Now I am going to inform the rights and obligations of the defendant.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	First, you have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民、或符合相關法令規定者，可申請法律協助。
en-US	Second, you have the right to a lawyer. If your financial status falls under poverty line, you are an aborigine or meet other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	Third, you have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you with his case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand you right?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of adultery case. The accuser is Yu-Han Wang. She filed a lawsuit against the defendant Edward Takayashi. He works in a cram school. He had some intimate messages with his coworker Rong-Er Wang. The defendant often worked overtime… He often made up a reason working overtime and he even had some tele-conferencing with Rong-Er Wang. They had beyond coworker’s relationship.The defendant, the accuser Yu-Han Wang filed a lawsuit against you for adultery. What’s your pledge?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the court will figure out the details of this case and to find whether the details are truth and can the details constitute adultery. Do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	The accuser, how long you have been married with your husband? Do you have child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years. We don’t have any child.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	You two got married in Taiwan or in other countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met each other in Taiwan. He wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the last four years, he was always teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we met each other, he was a teacher teaching Portuguese. Now he is still teaching.Because not many people really want to learn Portuguese in Taiwan, his teaching hours are not stable. There is even a period of one to two months between jobs.To have a more stable income, he wants to teach English but he… his mother tongue is not English so he decided to seek advanced degree. 

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned he wants to seek advanced degree. Does he want to seek a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He wanted to teach English so he needed to seek a degree of English teaching.He found a distance learning program of … in California in US. So he can learn English through distance learning. So he can get the degree just through distance learning and he can have the US degree to teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship between he and the person he has affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are coworkers in cram school. There is a rule in cram school that a Chinese teacher has to partner with a foreign teacher, so the person he has affair with is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, he just often worked overtime. I asked him it’s just an English cram school, why did you need to work overtime. He said he had to communicate with the Chinese teacher to prepare the courses.I did not doubt him at first but he gradually… uhh.. when he went home, he always got some phone calls and he did not answer the phone calls in front of him. He always picked up the phones in study room so I started to doubt him and I check his phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything wrong in his phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	He often called the same person and he sent messengers with the same one almost every single day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	I think it’s fine with the messages? Or the messages are inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	I am fine with the normal messages but the contents are too intimate and I have given some of the messages to the court. I think the messages are attached to the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Exhibit one, page 13, the records of the messages. The defendant, please check the exhibition. Are they messages in your phone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對，這是我手機裡的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	I’m going to ask questions according to the messages in your phone.The first message was sent at 9:50pm on Dec 21st, 2017. It was from 0958-932123. The content is “I really miss you, my love.” What does it mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	這是我同事發給的，因為那時候我休假兩天，她有點擔心，所有才有這個簡訊。我的同事在美國念書，她講話比較開放，那就是她表達方式，至於my love，那就是我們稱呼我們在乎的人的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that because the person who sent you the message is educated in a foreign county, she is more open-minded. So “my love” doesn’t mean anything. Right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	對阿，這就是一個很普通的稱呼方式。好朋友之間就這樣。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	what about the previous message?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	我說了，那就是她關心我的話而已。我們是工作上的搭檔，所以她關心我也很正常。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean that because you took two days off, she didn’t have the assistance during the classes so she sent that kind od message to you?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	對，所以才有那樣的簡訊，沒有什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent at 11:55pm on Dec 29th, 2017. It’s from the same person. The content is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does it mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這樣的簡訊告訴我怎麼樣用中文表達一件事情，那是我的功課。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	She sent you this message to help you with the assignment? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太所述，我有在進修，我需要修滿30個學生，所以我需要做點功課和練習也是很正常的。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you explain on you master degree? What’s it about?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程是關於TESOL 英文教學，它除了包含教學課程以外還有包含一些文化還有本身語言能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So the master degree is about English teaching but it includes some… cultural communication, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，我記得至少有三堂課是有關於文化和溝通。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	For these courses of cultural communication, they gave you what kind of assignments?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這些文化溝通課程給的功課，會因為不同的人而不一樣。就我來說，我在台灣，我想要一個教英文的教職，那我就必須要證明我的中文能力很好。所以我有很多功課是關於中英的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove your Chinese competence. That’s why the course give you the Chinese translation assignments?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對，當然我也有被…也有被訓練一些寫作和口說方面的能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So, the messages are your assignments?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，那就是我的作業，你知道中文句子很多時候對外國人很難，我就請我的同事把句子翻譯成英文，然後再用簡訊傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So you asked your colleague about the Chinese sentence and she translated it into English and sent it to you. This is the situation at that time? That is only the sentence of the assignment?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那句話只是我作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Exhibition 1, page 14 to 16. Please check the messages. Are these messages only for the assignments? They are only the answers to the assignments?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，這些簡訊都是我的功課而已。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So about your wife mentioning you have an affair with your coworker, what’s your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得我的太太真的想太多了，我知道她一直嫌我不夠專注在家庭。我想要庭上知道，她打從一開始就沒有支持我，關於我對碩士學位的進修。如果她當初有在我進修的時候幫忙我，那我也不需要問我的同事，我覺得她要對她的誤解負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, I think there are some unpleasant moments between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們一開始結婚的時候是很快樂，但問題是我的工作，我教葡萄牙文，授課時數不穩定。所以工作成了我們爭吵的重點，我們常為這個在吵，她不相信我已經很盡力了，我也無法讓她知道我多沮喪。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s come back to the Master program. When did this program start? Do you get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我從2015年秋天開始修這個碩士學位，我預計在2017年五月修完，但是我沒有拿到這個學位，因為我有一些兼職，我沒有時間去做作業。就像我剛剛說的，我的太太從來沒有幫忙過我，我一直都是一個人在做這件事情，我真的很累也很沮喪。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You said that this master program is a two-year course but you did not finish, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法完成課程的所有作業還有一些課程要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	When is your last semester of registration?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後日期是2017年的春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	According to your last registration date, that is May 2017. After that, you wouldn’t have any assignment but the massagers with your coworker last 7 months after that. Why?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒有完成課程不代表我不想學好中文，我還是想要精進我的語言能力，所以我就自學了

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that even though you did not finish the Master program, you still want to learn Chinese ad sharpen your Chinese ability, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	對，這就是為甚麼我請我的同事幫忙?

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the role of your colleague, she is like your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是家教，她是一個很好的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我原本想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you did not pay her, why she still send you the message during bed time? Is it beyond coworkers’ relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我說過她是一個很支持的朋友，她用她自己的時間來幫我。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	對，我還在那工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does the colleague still work there too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	她還在那工作，但我們不再是搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, is there any witness you want to subpoena or any evidence you want to investigate?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena the coworker in cram school, that is Rong-Er Wang in May Er May cram school. She can come to court as witness and explain the details of this case.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	About the coworker in cram school… I heard that people in cram people had taken some action on this matter. They tried to convince the coworker to quit. I would like to verify this matter.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? Your course had ended in May 2017. You cannot say that your messages are just for assignments. Furthermore, your interaction of messages is over 9:00pm. It cannot really be explained. So do you have any evidence you want to investigate?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我沒有任何想要法庭代為調查的證據，我和同事的關係真的很簡單，我只是想要精進我的中文能力。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next proceeding is at 4:30pm June 24th, 2018. We will have the procedure of questioning witness. The defendant and the accuser both need to show up. Both parties can hire a lawyer if necessary. Do you understand?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白。

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	I am going to read the defendant’s rights and obligations.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	First, you have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民、或符合相關法令規定者，可申請法律協助。

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是，我了解。

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparation procedure of an adultery case. The accuser is yu-han Wang. Sha prosecuted her husband, Edward Takayashi, for getting too close with his coworker, 蓉兒-Huang, in the school where Takayashi works. Yu-han Wang found many pieces of intimate message in the defendant’s cellphone. The defendant often works overtime by making up reasons, and he usually make tele-conferencing with his coworker, 蓉兒-Huang. And the accuser thinks that’s beyond coworkers’ relationship. The defendant, your wife doubts that you have an affair. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯，當然。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In the preparation procedure today, we will ask the defendant about those messages and see if these messages constitute an adultery. Do everybody understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Accuser, how long have you married with your husband? And do you have a child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years and we don’t have children.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. At that time, my husband came to Taiwan and wanted to teach Portuguese here

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the past few years, is his job teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	He was a Portuguese teacher when we get married, and he kept teaching Portuguese after we married. There are not many people in Taiwan that want to learn Portuguese. As a result, he has an unstable teaching hours and often has a period between jobs for about one or two months. Since he wanted to have more fixed income, he decided to start to teach English. Since his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just said he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean he wanted to earn a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Since he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he needed to get a degree of TESOL. He found a distance learning program established in California, USA. With this program, he can do online learning at home without going to the U.S. after he earned all the credits, he can get the degree and teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then, what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are coworkers in the same cram school. The program in the cram school, they will have a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher at one class. And they are partners in the class.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	In the beginning, I found my husband often stay in the school, working over time. I ask him why he had to work overtime just working in cram school. And my husband said he partnered with another Chinese teacher, so they need a lot of communications about the class. First, I didn’t doubt him at all. However, later I found that my husband often receives several calls after work. When he received the call, he didn’t speak in front of me. Instead, he went to his study room. So I decided to check his phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find any unusual in the defendant’s cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	First, I checked his record, and found there is always a same number. Then I checked his mail. I found that he nearly every day contact a woman by mail.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	That’s not so unusual sending a mail. Or is there anything strange?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If they are just ordinary messages, then I won’t care about them. But the woman sends some intimate words or sentences to my husband. He’s a married man! I have provided some contents to the court. I believe it’s in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	We are presenting file 1, page 13. The defendant, please check. Are these contents of messages the ones in your cellphone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對，這是我手機裡面的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Then I will ask some questions according to this. First messages. The time was 21st December, 2017 at 9:50 p.m. the message’s from 0958932123. The content was, “I really miss you, my love.” What does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	這個嘛，她是我的同事。那時候我休了兩天的假，她非常擔心我，所以傳訊息問我發生什麼事。我同事是在美國受的教育，所以她心胸很開放，她講話一直都是這樣子的，至於”my love”，這是我們在叫自己在乎的人、關心的人的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean your colleague is educated in the US, so her thought was westernized, so the way she talks are more open, and “my love” doesn’t mean anything. Is that correct?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	沒錯。這就只是很好的朋友，互相關心的朋友之間會講的話而已。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	What does the first sentence mean? “I really miss you.”

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，我們是同事，我們是工作搭檔。我請了兩天假，她當然會非常擔心我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean just because you take two days off, she sent this kind of message to you to tell you without your assistance in the class, she really miss you?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	沒錯，事情的背景就是這樣子。沒什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message. The time was 11:55 p.m., on 29th December, 2017, from the same number. The content was, “I want you by my side, when can we truly get together?” Why do you have this kind of message?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她是在教我要怎麼，她是在教我作業，她在教我這句話該怎麼用中文表達。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	She sends this message to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我妻子剛剛提到的，我正在攻讀碩士學位，我必須要修滿30個學分才能拿到學位，所以，我自然需要做一些作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you explain what on earth are you learning in your Master degree program?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我在修TESOL學位，這個學位主要是關於英語教學，也包括一些文化及語言能力的課程。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	You mean you are studying for an TESOL Master’s degree, and the program also includes cultural communication?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	沒錯，我記得至少有三堂課就跟文化溝通有關。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What kind of assignments do these culture and communication program give?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這些文化溝通課程的作業，會針對每一個學生而有不同，像是我的話，我想要在台灣找到一個教英文的工作，所以為了達到這個目標，並加強我的語言能力，我必須顯示我有很好的中文能力。所以我的作業有很多需要翻譯中文句子。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean since you want to teach English in Taiwan so you need to show that you have good Chinese competence. And so you will have the assignments like translation, right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，除此之外我還需要增強我的口說跟寫作的能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s come back to this question. Is this your assignment? The message in your phone?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，我記得我的這個作業，我需要將這個句子翻成英文，但是你也知道，有些中文字對我們來說，是很難詮釋、很難了解的，所以我請我的同事翻譯這個句子，並將答案寄給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You ask your colleague how to translate this sentence to English, so your colleague type this sentence in English and send to you. This message is just the answer of your assignment, correct?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊就只是我作業的解答而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Page 14 to 16 in file 1. That’s all message contents in your cellphone. Are they all your answers of your assignment?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯，這些簡訊全部都是為了完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Your wife accuse that you have an affair with your colleague. What’s your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我妻子真的想太多了，我知道她一直對我沒辦法穩定地養家這件事情很不滿意，她從我一開始修習這段課程開始，就沒有對我任何的支持。她完全不想協助我得到這個學位，如果她能多支持我一點，我就不用為了完成作業，向我的同事求助，所以她該為這整件事情負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, it seems that you two are not getting along with each other, right?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	剛結婚的時候，我們相處得很不錯，但是我的工作一直是個問題，我想要在這裡教葡萄牙語維生，但是我的授課時數一直都不穩定，我的工作問題一直成為我們吵架的話題，我的妻子不相信我已經盡力了，而我也沒有辦法讓她了解我所面對的挫折以及困境。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Alright. Let’s go back to your Master degree. When di

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2015年秋天開始課程，這是一個兩年的課程，所以我原本應該在2017年的5月就可以修習完畢，可是我在這期間也一直有在做兼職的工作，沒有時間完成我的作業，所以我還沒有得到學位。像我剛剛說的，我的妻子完全沒有給我任何支持，讓我覺得我是很孤獨地在攻讀這個學位，我非常的疲憊和挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You said this is a two-year program, and you didn’t finish it. Why is that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有的課程作業。我也沒有達到一些課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	When is your registration of the last semester?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是到2017年的春天為止。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	Like you said, your last semester was until May, 2017. Your messages should have been over after you finished that semester. However, your messages…you two kept sending messages to each other after 7 months…what’s your explanation?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	即使我的課程已經結束，可是我還想要繼續增進我的語言能力，所以課程結束之後，我還是想要自學。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean even if you didn’t get a Master’s degree, you still want to keep learning Chinese and want to speak fluent Chinese, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	對，所以我才繼續找我的同事求助。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So this colleague is playing a role of your tutor, correct?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，也是一位真心的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我想付費給她的，但是她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay for her, why she sends message to you at the time when she should go to bed. It’s not the thing just a coworker would do.

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個非常支持我的朋友，她願意犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still work in this cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是，我還在那裡工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is this colleague still work there, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	她也還在那裡工作，可是我們不是工作搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any evidence that want to investigate further or other witness you want to subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena this colleague, 黃蓉兒, in 美而美cram school as a witness and ask her about the relationship between she and the defendant and the context and purpose of those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Accuser, do you have any evidence that need the court to investigate further?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that 美而美cram school has taken some actions based on their relationship and even pursue 蓉兒-Huang to quit her job. I want to verify if this is true.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you have any evidence that you need the court to investigate for you? According to the situation now, you have already finished your program in May, 2017. You have no reason to send messages with your colleague by the excuse of doing assignment. Furthermore, you send messages to each other after 9 p.m. You need more evidence to help you with this case.

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到其他能請法庭代表我調查的證據，我和我同事之間的對話真的很單純，我只是想要增進我的語言能力，想要把中文學得更好。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next proceeding is set to be at 4:30 p.m. on 24th June, 2018. Both parties should appear in the court. You both can have a lawyer with you. Do both parties understand?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	The prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indi.. indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for adultery case. Umm.. the defendant, 王宇涵 ummis prosecuted..was prosecuted for adultery. Uh! The defendant has found her husband, Edward uh has the crime of adultery because she find a message, and he had intimate message with uh a woman called黃蓉兒, and it’s beyond co-worker’s relationship, so umm王宇涵, the accuser, wants to wanted to uh accused her husband, Edward, for adultery. The defendant, your wife is suspected suspects you umm had a crime of adultery, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然無罪

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s procedure preparation procedure, we will umm examine the details of the Edward’s the defendant’s messages, and try to see whether this constitutes the crime of adultery. Does Do both parties understand… today’s procedure? Have any problem?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, the accuser, how long have has your marriage been? Do both of you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married four years, and we don’t have any children.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Then, are both of you married in Taiwan? Or in other countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	Both of us were met in Taiwan. Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan umm to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the past four years, is his job is to teaching to teach Portuguese? Or, does he have other jobs?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	Umm, at first when we got married, he was still a Portuguese teacher. Umm After we married, he was still teaching Portuguese. Umm However, Portuguese isn’t a very hot uh very… many people want to learn Portuguese…there are not many people want to learn Portuguese, so his teaching hours is not stable, and sometimes he has a period between jobs. Umm After that, he wants to make his income more stable, so he wanted to teach English instead of Portuguese. However, English is not his mother tongue, so he has to he has to seek an advanced degree umm on English.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree umm. Does this mean that umm he wants to umm another degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, I he he wants a degree on English because he wants to teach English and his degree is should… should be about English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California, USA, so he don’t have to go to the school. He can uhh use this terms of learning to learn English. After he finished all the credits, he can get a umm master degree in USA, so he might can find a teaching job in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then, what’s the relationship between the husband and the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	Umm The woman is his co-worker in the cram school. The cram school will arrange a Chinese teacher and an English teacher uh for English teaching, and umm the woman is partner with my husband.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know that they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	Umm At first, I just noticed that he usually work late, and I asked him many times umm why is an English cram school so busy? He answered me that he has to be partner with the Chinese teacher. Umm and they have to prepare for the next class, so they are busy. At first, I didn’t suspect him, and I just found that after he returned to home, he sometimes picked up the phone and even just umm hide hid in the study room, and don’t want me to see it…see this situation. So, I started to suspect he might have an affair with someone else.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	In the cell phone, did you find any umm weird part?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	Umm, I found umm I found umm the same number which frequently appeared in his phone book umm which is really weird, so I just find who the girl is, and I found is Ms. 黃.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even it’s just messages, it sounds okay. Umm Is there anything weird? Is there any intimate message in there?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it’s just a normal messages, I would think it’s fine. But my husband is a married man, how could he sent…how could that woman send so intimate messages to him?Umm, I already I already offered some evidence. It should already be in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Umm Just as We will show some evidence about this case. We will display some pic..pictures in the investigatory file page three. Umm is this message in youy cell phone? Is this the message which you sent to the woman?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的, 這些是在我的手機上的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Then, so, then I will I will umm ask some questions according to your messages. Umm on the date of December twenty-one, 2017, at the time twenty-one fifty p.m., there was a messages sent by the number 0958932123. The content was umm I really miss you my baby. Is this sent by the woman?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	恩, 這個是我的同事傳給我的, 我記得那個時候我請了兩天假, 她很擔心我的質狀況所以傳這封簡訊給我, 恩, 我的同事是在美國受教育的, 所以她的思想是開放的, 恩, 這種訊息只是我們關心對方的一種方式, 所以並沒有什麼不妥之處

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So you’re meaning that umm your co-worker studied in foreign country, in US., so she is westernized and open-minded, so “my love” sisn’t mean anything special or intimate. Is that right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	恩, 沒有, 這沒有什麼特別的意思, 這只是單純朋友之間的訊息, 或者是你傳給你在意的人的一種很普通的訊息罷了

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	Then what… what about the previous sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我剛剛的一樣, 我們是很好的同事, 痾, 我請了兩天假, 她只是很擔心我, 所以才傳了這封訊息給我

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So, you are meaning that her message is just to express that she reallycared about you, and without your assistant in the cram school, she was hard in the job. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的, 這就是那封簡訊的內容, 恩這個根本就沒有甚麼大不了的

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	So, next I will we will talk about the next the second message. It was at the time 11:55 p.m. on the date 2017 December 29th from the same person. Umm, the context is “I want you to by my side, when can we truly be together.”

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳…當時她傳這封簡訊只是想要表達恩這句英文..這個中文要怎麼寫, 在我的功課範圍之上

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So, you are saying that the the woman sent you this message just to help you with your assignment? What does this mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我老婆剛剛所告告知法官的, 我當時正在修一個碩士課程, 需要修完30學分, 這個是我必須做的功課之一,

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you please explain what did you learn…what did you learn in your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	恩我的碩士學位是有關於英語教學的, 只要是關於怎麼教英文, 其他部分還有關於文化還有一些語言能力的部分

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So, you are meaning that your master degree is related to TESOL, and in this program also have some courses related to language competence. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的, 我至德..記得至少有3門課是和文化還有溝通有關係的

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So, what’s your assignment in this kind of culture and communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這個文化與溝通課程會依每個學生的狀況不同而有所變化,就以我自己為例子, 我想要在台灣尋求教英文的一職, 恩 為了達成我的目標, 並且顯是我的語言能力, 恩所以才會有這樣子的功課, 所以很多我的功課內容都是關於中英翻譯

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So, you’re telling me that you want to find a teaching position in Taiwan; umm to reach this goal, the culture courses includes some Chinese translation, and also this translations is part of your assignment. Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的, 恩 我還需要增進自己的會話和寫作的能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	OK, let’s go back to your pre previous sentence. Umm Do you mean that this is your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的, 當我收到個功課的時候, 恩, 你也知道外國人對學中文這件事情是非常難的, 所以我不知道要怎麼翻譯, 我就把這個句子傳給我的同事, 請求她的協助, 希望她能幫我翻譯這句話

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So your meaning is umm because you don’t know the sentence the translation of this sentence, so you sent this message to your co-worker, and asked her to send the Chinese translation back umm. It is just for your assignment only? And didn’t have other special meanings?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊只是我的作業答案

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Ok, then let’s show some evidences. See the file from the p.14 to p.16, the content of the message. So, all of the messages are only related to your assignment and didn’t have other special meaning?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的, 這些所有的訊息都只是為了完成我的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then, according to your wife, about you have love affair with your co-worker, what’s your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	恩我覺得我的老婆只是想太多了, 她就是不滿 對於我的工作能力不能滿足, 恩覺得我沒辦法支持這個家庭, 但從一開始, 我學這個碩士課程的時候, 她也沒給我任何的協助, 恩因..因為她不願意幫我, 如果她願意幫我的話, 或是就是幫那麼一點點忙, 我也不用去拜託我的同事, 所以我覺得她就是這件..誤會的罪魁禍首

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	Just as what you mentioned, umm both you and your wife are not getting well with each other?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	恩在我們的婚姻一開始我們確實相處得很好, 而且有很多甜蜜的時光, 但是在這之後, 她對我的就業狀況感到不滿, 我一開始是教葡萄牙文, 但是我的工作時數不穩定, 然後這個就變成我們爭執的原因, 她不相信我曾經為了這件事情努力過而且掙扎過, 然後個就變成我們之間的問題並且會常常為了這事情而爭吵不休

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Well, let’s go talk about your master degree. When did the master degree begin, and how was it going? Did the master degree end or not?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	恩這個碩士學位是在2015年開始的一個兩年學程, 它應該要在2017年結束, 但是因為我自己個人的打工工作, 所以我最後沒有如期地完成, 就像我剛剛所說的, 我的老婆並沒有就是為我幫我完成這個學位, 痾我覺得我從頭到尾都是孤軍藝人在學這個學位, 這讓我覺得非常地挫折和非常地疲倦

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So you’re meaning that this should be a 2-year program, but you didn’t finish it, why? What’s the reason for you that you didn’t finish the program?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	恩我沒辦法完成所有的課堂作業, 還有一些課程要求我也無法完成

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	Then, when is your your.. the last.. the final semester that you registered?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我的最後一個註冊學期是在2017年的春

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If what you just mentioned are true, then your courses and your program should be ended in May 2017. You shouldn’t have any assignment of this program. Then why did you have this kind of messages...this kind of assignment with your co-worker even after you end your program for 7 months? What’s your explanation?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	雖然我的我的碩士課程已經結束, 但這不表示我不想再精進我的中文, 就算課程結束, 我還是想練習中文翻譯, 所以我才傳訊息給她

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So, you are telling me that even this program already ended, you still want to polish your Chinese ability. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的, 這就是為什麼我請我的同事來幫我

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So, in this whole situation, the co-worker that you mentioned is acted like a tutor of yours…tutor.

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不僅是一位家教, 她對我而言更是我朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Then did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有, 我曾經提議要付她錢, 但是她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her for money, then why did she send you the messages at midnight? Normal people will sleep at this time. Umm Isn’t this beyond co-worker’s relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這件是為什麼我說她是一個非常幫助我的朋友, 她會犧..使用自己的時間來教我中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still teaching in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的, 我還在那裏工作

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So, this co-worker, is she still working in that cram school?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是的, 她仍在那裏教書, 但是我們並不再是拍檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, so do you still have any evidence or any witness that needs the court to help you subpoena or gather?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	Umm I want the court to help me subpoena the witness, the co-worker, 黃蓉兒, who is working in that cram school,美而美. Umm, I want her to describe the details of the messages and the relationship between her and the defendant.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The defendant, do you want any evidence that the court help you to investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I have heard that the cram school, 美而美, already took taken some actions on this issues, and tried to persuaded the woman not to do so. Umm can I have more details about this?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you need any evidence that want the court to help you investigate? Umm Now your master degree should ended in May 2017. You have no reasons to send messages with umm that woman. This shouldn’t be an excuse to do so. Moreover, most of your messages were sended at 9 pm, which is very suspicious. Do you need any evidence that want the court to help you investigate?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我並沒有任何證據需要法官痾法庭幫我查, 恩因為就像我所說的, 我跟我的同事的對話都是非常簡單, 我只是想要精進中文, 並持續練習我的中文

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court will set on umm June 24th 2018 at 14:30 p.m. All of the people, including the defendant, the accuser, and the witness should be here. If you need a lawyer, you can apply for a lawyer. Do both parties understand?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也了解

en-US	I’m going to inform the defendant of following obligations and rights

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的我了解

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	The prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparation procedure for an adultery case. The accuser, 王宇涵, sued his husband, Edward Paparazzi for his relationship with his colleague, which is more intimate than usual. When the accuser checked his husband’s, Edward’s phone message, she found that his husband sends some intimate message with his colleague, and his husband often find an excuse for working late, or going out at midnight, and she found that his husband has an intimate relationship with 黃蓉兒, his colleague, so she sued the case that his husband has some relationship beyond co-worker… and he has an affair beyond co-worker’s relationship with his colleague.The defendant, your wife wants to sue you for adultery, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然沒有罪啊。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparation procedure, we will ask the both parties some questions to confirm if the defendant really reach the level of adultery and we will check the message detail today to see if the defendant reach the level of adultery. Do the the both parties understand today’s procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, the accuser, how long since.. have … since you married to your husband? How many childrens do you have?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have married for four years, and we don’t have any children.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Where did you marry? In Taiwan or in other countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So…Does your husband teach Portuguese for the past several years? Or is there any other language he taught?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	He has taught Portuguese for the four past years, and after we got married, he still taught Portuguese. Because Portuguese isn’t an popular language in Taiwan, so he doesn’t have many teaching hours, and he doesn’t have a steady income. So maybe sometimes he will have up to one or two months period between jobs. So to have a steady income, he wants to teach English. But English isn’t his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he wants to seek an advanced degree, do you mean that he’s looking for a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, I mean that because he wants to teach English, he has to have a degree of TESOL. He found a course on the Internet, and the course is from California, America, and the course provide distant learning program which is distance learning, so he doesn’t have to go to the US and he can enjoy the courses. So after he finished his distance learning program, he can gain a master degree, so he planned to get TESOL and to gain a license to teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what’s the relationship between he and his adultery partner?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	In the courses, there is an English teacher and a Chinese teacher, and they are colleague relationship. That girl is his Chinese teacher in his company. And they are partner relationship.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you that your husband has an affair with his colleague?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At the beginning, I only found that he often worked late in the cram school, but after that, I started to think that it is only a cram school, why do you have to work this late? But he explained that because he is an English teacher, he has a lot to communicate with the Chinese teacher so he have to stay in the cram school to communicate with his colleague. At first, I didn’t suspect him. But after I found that when he got home, he often got some phone calls, and he doesn’t want to pick up the phone in front of me. Instead, he went to his study room to talk in the phone. I wonder why he did this, so later I checked his phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything unusual in his cell phone

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	So later I went to check his dial record, and I found that there’s always a same number on his phone, so later I went to check his phone message, and I found that every night he messaged the same woman…every night.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	It is not that serious if he sent a message to a woman? Or you found some inappropriate message in his cell phone?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it is only some ordinary messages, it’s ok for me. But he’s married, how can he let a woman send some intimate message to him? Before, I have sent some message to court, they are in the file. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	The displayed evidence one. Here is some message from the phone. The defendant, please check if it is the content of your message.

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這是我手機裡的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Then I’ll ask some questions based on the messages. The first message which is sent on nine fifty pm, twenty first December, 2017, from the phone number 0958932123, to your cell phone. The message said, 我真的很想你，what does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	這個是我的一個同事傳給我的。那個時候，我請了兩天的假，他非常擔心我，所以他才傳了這封訊息給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，所以他的思想非常開放，他講這些話都很正常，而我很想你，這些都是因為他關心我所以才會說的話，我們都是這樣溝通的。至於My love，我的愛，那只是因為我們很熟，所以我們都這樣稱呼對方。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that because your colleague is educated in the foreign country, so she is westernized, so the message “my love” is because she is open-minded and it doesn’t mean anything, is that right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	沒有啊，那沒有什麼意思，那就只是很好很好的朋友之間會互相稱呼的一個名字而已，或者是非常關心對方的朋友也會這樣講。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	Then what’s the previous sentence in this message?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我講的一樣，我們兩個是非常好的朋友，而之前我請兩天假的時候，他非常的擔心我，所以他才傳了那些訊息給我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So do you mean that because you took two days off, so she didn’t have your help when she is having a class so she missed you a lot, is that your meaning?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	對啊，那就是簡訊的內容，我覺得沒有什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	So the second message is sent on eleven fifty-five pm, on twenty nine December 2017, from the same cell phone to your cell phone, and the context is “I want you to by my side, when can we be together?” 我想要你待在我的身邊，什麼時候我們才能在一起呢? Why does the message have this context? And what’s your explanation? Why do you have this message?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	當初他傳這封簡訊只是想要教我一句我不會的中文，然後他只是要教我這句話要怎麼講。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you mean that your colleague sent this message to you is to help you to learn Chinese, what does that mean? What do you mean she helped you to do your homework?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太之前有提到的，我現在正在進行一個碩士課程，所以我必須要完成三十個學分才能拿到這個學位，那當然我要完成這個學位我必須完成一些作業還有練習，這就是為什麼。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you please first explain what do you learn in your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是關於英語教學的。然後這個計畫是教你怎麼去教英文還有一些文化上的問題，所以這其中也包含了語言能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you’re having TESOL classes in your master degree, and it includes some cultural communication, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	沒錯，我記得至少有三門課都是有關文化，還有語言溝通的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So the so-called cultural communication classes, what assignment you have to accomplish in this course?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	我的們文化還有溝通作業是因人而異的，每個學生都不一樣，就像拿我自己來說好了，因為我在台灣想要尋找一個英語教學的職位，所以我必須要證明我自己的語言能力，我必須證明我的中文能力是好的。所以我有很多作業都是中英文翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So do you mean that you want to teach English in Taiwan, so currently you’re studying a master degree to cultivate your Chinese competence…ability? So you have to finish some assignments which is related to Chinese-English translation, is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，所以此外我還必須加強我的會話、口說還有寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Ok so let us be back to the sentence we just mentioned. So is it a part of your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，我還記得這些句子。這些句子我必須要把它翻譯成中文，然後，這些中文我必須把它翻譯成英文，而且你知道有的時候這些中文的句子對於外國人來說是非常難理解的，所以我才尋求我的同事幫忙。拜託他幫我翻譯成英文然後拜託他把答案傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you typed a Chinese sentence to her and she sent back the answer which is an English sentence to you, is it the situation at that time? So you mean that it is only your assignment, is that right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊就是我作業的答案而已，就這樣。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Ok, let us take a look at the displayed evidence, page 14 to 16, these are all contexts of your messages. So in these pages, are the messages all your assignment which is the assignment you asked your colleague for help?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯啊，這些都是幫助我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So according to your wife, your wife just said that you have an affair with your colleague, so what’s your explanation on that?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得我的太太真的是想太多了。我知道他一直不滿意我對家庭沒有什麼幫助，但在一開始在我學習中文的時候，他也一樣就是也沒有給我什麼支持。他後來完全不支持我完成這個學位，而且如果他有給我支持的話，我也不會找我的同事幫忙。所以我覺得他應該要對整件事情負責，他不應該誤會我，而且他也沒有給我支持。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, there’s something unhappy between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們婚姻一開始的時候，我們也是有一些美好的時光的，但是問題就是在我的職業。我原本一開始是教葡萄牙文的，但是這並不能給我一個穩定的收入，我不能獲得足夠的教學時數。後來因為工作不穩定，成為了我們兩個常常吵架的原因，我們常常吵架，而我的太太不相信我有盡我最大的努力去找工作或學習英文，然後我也沒有辦法讓他理解我的挫折還有我面臨的困難。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Well let’s get back to the issue of your master degree. When did you start your master degree? And did you finish it? Did you get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我的碩士在2015年的秋季開始的，原本他應該是一個兩年的計畫，預計在2017年的五月結束，但我並沒有完成這個碩士課程，因為我一邊做我的打工，還要一邊上課，我沒有辦法兩邊兼顧。就像我之前說的，我在讀我的碩士學位的時候，我太太並沒有給我支持，我覺得在讀碩士的一路上我都是一個人，所以我開始覺得很累也覺得很挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So you just mentioned that it is a two-year program, but in the end you didn’t finish it. Why didn’t you finish it?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	因為我沒有辦法完成我課程所有作業。還有一些課程的要求我沒辦法達到。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So when is your registration of your last semester? When did your register end of your last semester?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期的期限是2017年的春季。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So if what you said is true, then your course finished in May 2017, so it is reasonable to say that you won’t have any assignment if your courses are finished. But you and your colleague still have sent message to each other for seven months after your course is finished. 

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	嗯…我的課程結束了不代表我就不想要精進我的中文，我還想精進我的中文，然後完成一些我自己的作業，所以我才傳那些訊息給我的同事去精進我的作文。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So do you mean that you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that what you mean?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，這就是為什麼我要找我的同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So you mean that you colleague is playing a role of your home tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不只是我的家教，他還是我很好的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我本來想付她錢的但他拒絕我了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, then why did she sent messages at the midnight to you, which is the time you should go to bed, and she didn’t say anything and she’s not afraid of tiredness to send messages to you? Is it the relationship beyond co-workers?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說他是一個非常支持我的朋友。因為他用他自己的時間來幫助我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	So do you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的，我還是在那邊工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So does your colleague still works there too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是的，他也在那邊工作，但我們現在已經不是搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, is there any other people you want to subpoena? Or any evidence you want to investigate further? 

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena his colleague, who is 蓉兒黃, working in the cram school named 美而美, I hope she can come to the court as a witness and I want to ask her about the relationship between her and the defendant. And I want to ask about the background of the messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school named 美而美 has taken some actions towards the relationship between Edward and 黃蓉兒, and it is about the fact that 黃蓉兒’s leaving her position. I want to ask the cram school if it is true.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate for you? So the situation now is that your course is finished at May, 2017, so you really don’t have any reason to finish your homework by sending these messages, and most of the messages are sent after nine pm, this is very suspected, so do you have any evidence to prove your situation?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我現在想不到法院可以幫我調查的證據，但是就像我講的一樣，我跟我同事之間的關係是非常簡單的，我只是想要精進我的語言能力，然後繼續把中文學好，就這樣子而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court is set at four thirty pm, 24 June, 2018, and we will proceed the procedure of questioning the witness. The both parties please come to the court, and you both can have a lawyer, do you understand?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白。

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	Now will inform the obligation and rights of the defendant

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	First, you have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民、或符合相關法令規定者，可申請法律協助。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我知道。

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	May the prosecutor please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The accuser Yu-Hang Wang has prosecuted the defendant Edward Takayashi because the defendant has worked in a cram school, and he has many messages in his phone with another co-worker in that cram school. The defendant sometimes overworks and also have some teleconferencing with the other party. The accuser believes that their relationship has been beyond co-worker’s relationship. Therefore, she has prosecuted this case. The defendant, you wife has suspected you for adultery, what is your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然是無罪答辯。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, we will ask the defendant the message he has with the co-worker in order to know whether they had an affair. Do both parties understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	I would first like to ask the accuser. How long have you been married and is there any children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	I have married my husband for 4 years and we do not have any child.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Where do you and your husband married? Is it in Taiwan or in other country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan four years ago, and he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	Over the past years, is his job always teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he is still teaching Portuguese. However, there are not many Taiwanese wanted to learn Portuguese, so his teaching hours is always unstable, there might be a period of one to two months between his jobs. After that, he wanted to have a stable income, so he decided to teach English. However, English is not his native language. Therefore, he is seeking an advanced degree for English.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that he was seeking an advanced degree. Does that mean that he is trying to earn a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he need a TESOL degree. He has found an online course on the Internet based in California, United States, so he decided to earn his degree from this distance learning course. He believes that in this way, he could finish his credits, and he could earn a US master degree, so he could teach in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What is his relationship with the person he had an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues in a cram school, and in their cram school, they will partner an English teacher and a Chinese teacher, and that colleagues is his partner in the cram school.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know that your husband has an affair with her?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	Since my husband always work late in cram school, so I ask him “It is just an American cram school. How come you have to overwork?” He told me that he has to collaborate with the Chinese teacher, so he has to stay in the cram school to discuss about their work. At first, I did not suspect him at all. However, he always received phone call, and he will not answer it in front of me. He will go to the study room to answer it, so I decided to check his phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything particular in his phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, there is always a same number calling to him. Out of curious, I check his text messages, and I realized they have a lot of text messages every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Those are just text messages, so it should be okay, or is there anything inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it is just normal text messages, it should be fine. However, he is a married man, and why would he still text some intimate messages? I have provided some of their intimate messages to the court in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Show file 1 page 13. The defendant, here are some text messages. Are these text messages you have on your phone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這些是在我手機上的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	I would like to ask the details for these text messages. The first message is sent at 9:50 pm, December 21st 2017, and the phone number is 0958932123 sending to your phone. The content is “I really miss you, my love.” What does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	他就只是我的同事而已，我記得我當時請假兩天，他很關心、擔心我，所以他才會傳簡訊來。我的同事是在美國受教的，所以他還蠻開放的。所以他才會那樣說，“my love” 就只是我們關心對方的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because the sender stays in a foreign country before, so it means that she is westernized, and when she said “my love” does not mean anything at all?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	是的，這段表達的方式只是我們在乎對方的方式。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the phrase before that?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，他很擔心我。我是他的搭擋，因此他當然很擔心

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because you did not go the work for two days, and you could not assist her, so she texted I really miss you?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的，這就是簡訊內容上面的意思，並沒有什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent on the same phone at 11:55 pm, December 29th 2017. The text message is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this text message mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他之所以傳給我這封簡訊，是告訴我如何用中文表達這句話的意思

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You said that the other party send this message to help you with the assignment. What does that mean

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	我老婆剛剛有提到我正在爭取我的碩士學位，我必須要拿到30學分才能取得學位，所以當然會有一些作業需要完成。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you please first explain about your Master’s Degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位主要是有關於英語教學。裡面的課程來講的話，主要就是如何教學英文，以及文化和語言能力相關的課程。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you are now pursuing TESOL degree, and there are some cross-cultural communication courses?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是，我記得有至少三堂課是和文化溝通有關的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What are the assignments for the cultural communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這些文化溝通的課程，作業因人而異。以我自己為例，我現在在台灣教英文，我必須要有好的中文溝通能力。因此，我的作業當中有很多是和中英文翻譯相關。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean that because you have planned to teach English in Taiwan , so you have to prove that you have a good command of Chinese, and you have to practice English-Chinese translation. Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的。我也被要求加強我的口說和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to the text message. Is this one of your assignment

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，我還記得那條訊息。你也知道中文對於外國人並不是很簡單，我當時看到中文句子不知道要怎麼翻。因此我才請她幫助我，然後他翻給我這段訊息。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You have sent her the English message, and she has help you translated. Is that what you mean? 

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那條訊息僅僅只是為了我的答案而用而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Let’s show file 1 page 14 to 16. These are the content of your text messages. Are these messages your assignment that you have to translated, so you seek for help?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些訊息都是相同的目的，為了完成我的作業而已。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What is your explanation on your wife suspecting you having an affair with your colleague?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太想太多了，我知道我自己沒有賺很多錢去支撐這個家庭，但在我念碩士學位上，他並沒有給予太多的支持和幫助。我覺得他不願意幫我完成這份學位，如果他能夠多付出一點心力的話，我覺得我就不會去問我同事了，因此他的錯比較大。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you said, you do not get along with your wife, do you?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	一開始，我們的確過得很幸福，但是就業一直是個問題。我當時想要教學葡萄牙文，但是我的授課時數一直不穩定。在就業這個議題上一直是個問題，我們在這件事上爭論。他一直認為我並沒有盡力去找到一份好的工作，我也無法向他表達我垂頭喪氣的一面。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Now let’s get back to the Master’s degree courses. When did your courses start and end? Have you earned your degree yet?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2015年的秋天開始上課，這是一個兩年的課程，所以預計會在2017年5月完成。但是因為我有兼職工作，並沒有足夠的時間完成作業，因此還沒有取得學位。就像我說的，我太太並沒有想要幫我的意思，我要自己完成這份學位，我感到疲倦、挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mentioned that the course is a two-year program, but you did not finish it. Why is that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成所有的作業以及課程上所設立的標準。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	When is the last semester you have registered?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我最後一個學期註冊是在2017年的春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If everything you stated was correct, your semester should end on May 2017, and you will not have any assignment anymore. Why do you still text your colleague 7 months after the semester?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	雖然我沒有完成學位，但並不代表我不想精進我的語文能力。因此我仍繼續和我的同事來往，希望能夠精進我的中文。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You did not finish your degree, but you still want to practice your Chinese to become more fluently. Is that what you mean?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，所以我才會請我同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	Is your colleague playing the role of a tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不僅是我的家教，也是我的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay her for tutoring?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	並沒有，我原本想要付錢，但他卻拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you did not pay for her, why did she try to text you in the middle of the night after sleeping hours? The situation is beyond co-workers.

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	所以我才說他是一個很支持我的朋友，他用他自己的時間幫助我。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still working in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的，我還是在那裡工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does this colleague still work in that cram school?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是，他仍在那家補習班，但我們不再繼續搭擋合作了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Did the prosecutor have any witness to subpoena or any evidence to investigate on?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena the colleague 黃蓉兒from 美而美cram school as a witness in order to explain her relationship with the defendant and the text messages she sent.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Is there anything the accuser would like the court to investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has taken action to their relationship. The cram school has asked 黃蓉兒 to quit her job. I would like to ask whether the court could verify this matter.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	Did the defendant have anything you want the court to investigate on? The current situation is that your registration for the Master’s Degree has already finished on May 2017, so you should not use finishing assignment for explanation for the text message with黃蓉兒, especially with those messages were texted after 9 pm, so is there anything you want us to investigate on?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我並沒有任何證據能夠證明這件事，但我們的關係真的非常單純，就是我想要學語言，增進我的中文能力。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next proceeding of this case will be on 4:30 pm June 24th 2017. We will move on to the cross-examination of the witness. Both the accuser and defendants could hire lawyers if necessary. Do both parties understand?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白。

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	The same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The accuser is Yu-Han Wang. She prosecuted his husband, 愛德華•塔喀牙什, for an adultery with his co-worker in the cram school because Yu-Han Wang thinks they are too intimate. She found there are a lot of intimate messages in his husband’s cellphone, and Edward Takayashi usually makes up reasons for overworks and get along with his co-worker. The defendant, your wife thinks you have an adultery with the other, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我沒罪啊。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s procedure, we are going to ask the defendant about the details of messages. And we will decide whether it constitutes adultery or not. And do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	The accuser, how long have you get married with your husband? Do you have a child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have got married for four years, and we don’t have child.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	So, do you get married in Taiwan or overseas?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met in Taiwan four years ago. He came Taiwan, and he wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, for the past years, is his job always teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we met each other at that time, he was a Portuguese teacher. And after we get married, he was still a Portuguese teacher. In Taiwan, there is a few people learning Portuguese. So, his teaching hour was unstable. And there can even be one to two months a period of time between jobs. He wanted a stable job, so he wanted to teach English. However, his mother tongue wasn’t English. So, his sought an advanced degree for that.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	So, you just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree, is that he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan, right?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get a degree about English teaching. He found a distance learning program on California in United States. It is an on-line learning, and he can get his degree at home. After he completes all the courses, he can get a master degree. Through this, he can find a job about English teaching.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So, how’s the relationship of he and the person he has affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in the cram school. And in that cram school, they tend to partner with a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher. And the person he has affair with is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	So, how do you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	To begin with, my husband usually overworks, and I ask him, it’s just a English cram school, why do you often overwork? And he replied me that because he needed to partner with the Chinese teacher, there was a lot of thing to communicate. At first, I don’t really suspect him. However, he often has some phones after school, and he usually went to the study room to talk. So, I checked the cellphone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So, is there anything wrong in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	After I check his record of phone, I found there was a person usually in his phone book. So, I check his messages afterwards, and I also found there was a woman often messaging him.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even the messages, that won’t a big problem, right? Or the content was inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it a common message, it isn’t a big deal. But my husband was a married man, and how can a woman message him some intimate messages? And I offered some messages for the court in advance, the judge can check that.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Show the evidence, page 13. The defendant, are these messages on your cellphone, right?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這些是我手機裡面的訊息。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now, I am going to ask you about these messages. The first message was on 12/21 in 2017, the time was 9:50 P.M. And the cellphone number was 0958-932123. And the content was that I really miss you, my love, could you explain what’s that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那是我同事傳給我的，然後我記得那天我已經兩天沒去上班了，所以他才傳給我，關心我一下。我同事是在美國受教育的，所以她非常的開放，然後她之所以會叫我親愛的，那是她表現在乎的人的稱呼方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that the person messages you was educated in United States, so her thought was open-minded and westernized. So, she calls you “my love,” it doesn’t mean anything, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	嗯對啊，那是我們對於親密的朋友會有的稱呼，並沒有什麼特別的意思。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	So, how about the previous sentences?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，我們是同事，然後她非常的關心我，我兩天都沒有去上班，所以她傳個簡訊關心我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you didn’t work for two days, so she didn’t have your assistance, so she really miss you, right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	對，就像是簡訊上傳的一樣，這根本就沒有什麼大不了的啊。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent on 12/29 in 2017. The time was 11:55 P.M. And it was sent by the same person, the content was that I want you by my side, when can we be truly together. So, could you explain for that?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳這封簡訊是為了如何幫我用中文敘述我的中文作業。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So, you mention that the other party sent the message for you for assisting you to do the Chinese homework. What’s that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	 我老婆剛剛也有提到了，我因為想要找一個英文教師的工作，所以我參加了一個遠距教學的碩士課程，然後在課程裡，我必須完成30個學分，我才可以拿到學位，所以這個作業是在課程裡面所要求的。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	So, could you explain for what do you have to study for your distance learning program for the master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程主要是英語教學的課程，然後裡面還會包含一些語言能力，還有文化之間的溝通課程。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So, your master degree is about TESOL, right? However, it also contains some culture communication, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得有三門課是有關文化溝通的課。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So, about the culture communication courses, what’s its homework?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	文化溝通課程的作業會是因人而異的，以我來舉例好了，因為我想要在台灣找一個英語教學的工作，所以呢，我的作業就必須對我的中文是很要求的。所以呢，我的作業當中有很多是中英文需要翻譯的東西。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that because you wanted to teach English in Taiwan; however, there is a certain Chinese command for you. So, the assignments for culture communication ask you to translate some Chinese and English sentence, right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的沒錯，而且我還要精進我的閱讀跟寫作的能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So, let’s back to the message. Is this message your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對的，那是我的作業，然後那句句子必須中文翻成英文，你也知道的，外國人學習中文是很辛苦的，因為有些字我們真的認不出來，所以我就請我的同事幫忙，然後請她幫我翻譯成中文再傳送過來。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that you ask for the translation of the Chinese sentence, and your colleague translates it in English? So, the message is just an answer for the assignment?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	是的，那個簡訊只是我功課的解答。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Let’s show the evidence 1, page 14 to 16. Are all these messages just the answers for your assignment?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊都是為了要協助我完成作業的解答。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So, what’s your opinion about your wife’s thought, you have affair with your co-worker?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太對於這件事真的是想太多了，而且我剛開始攻讀這個遠距教學課程的時候，她就沒有給予我任何支持，然後她還覺得我對這個家庭不用心。她完全不支持我攻讀這個課程，所以我有作業難題的時候也只好去找我的同事，她應該要為這整件誤會負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	So, according to your thought, is there anything unhappy between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們一開始是相處非常愉快的，但是呢，主要就是我工作的問題，因為我想要在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是這個教學時數是非常不固定的，所以我們就有一些爭吵。所以這就變成我們之間最大的問題，她不相信我真的已經盡力去找工作了，所以我們就常常為了這個事情爭吵，然後這讓我非常的挫折，然後我也不知道如何面對她。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	So, let’s go back to your master degree program. When did it begin, and is it over?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2015年開始我的碩士課程的，預計在2017年會拿到學位，但因為我一直有在做兼職，最後學分有點拖延，所以沒有拿到這個學位。就像我所說的，我太太從來不支持我讀這個學位，然後這段期間我遇到學業上的瓶頸的時候也沒人可以支持我，這讓我覺得很累又很挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mention that the master degree was a two-year degree, how did you fail to complete?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有的學分，還有一些其他課程要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	When was your last semester of your registration?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我最後註冊的學期是2017年的下學期。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you mention, the last semester registration was in spring in 2017. So, reasonably speaking, there was not any homework after that. However, you have messages with your co-worker after 7 months. Why do you do that?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	即使我沒有拿到那個學位，這不代表我就不想要精進我的語言能力，所以在那之後，我還是一直嘗試著想要精進我的中文能力，所以我就一直靠著自學的方式來進修。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that even though you didn’t complete that master degree, you still want to sharpen your Chinese language skill. So, you try your best to learn Chinese, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，所以我找我的同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	 So, your co-worker is kind of your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是家教，而且還是我一個非常要好的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Do you pay for her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay for her, why does she still message you in the midnight? Is this totally beyond co-worker’s relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說她是非常有義氣的朋友，然後她甚至不辭辛勞犧牲自己私人時間來幫我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的，我還在那邊工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is your colleague still in there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	她還有在那邊工作，但我們沒有常常搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any evidence or witness and wanted to investigate or subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I wanted to subpoena the co-worker of the defendant, Rong-Er Huang, as a witness. I hope she will be on court to explain the messages and the relationship with the defendant.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, do you have any evidence and want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard about that Mei Er Mei Cram School tried to intervene this event, and they even tried to fire Rong-Er Huang. So, I hope the court ask Mei Er Mei Cram School to verify the situation.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence and want the court to investigate for you? Your problem is that your master degree should be over in May in 2017, and you really didn’t have any reasons for messaging with your co-worker, Rong-Er Huang. And most importantly, you usually message each other after 9 P.M. every night, it’s really hard for us not to suspect you. So, do you have anything to help with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我沒有進一步的證據可以證明這件事，但是就像我所說的，我跟我同事之間的簡訊真的單純只是為了想要精進我的中文能力而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court is set on 6/24 in 2018. The time is 4:30 P.M. We will ask questions for the witness. If the both party have necessary assistance, you can have a lawyer.

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也了解了。

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	Now I’m going to inform the right and obligations of the defendant.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	First, you have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民、或符合相關法令規定者，可申請法律協助。
en-US	Second, you have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low-income family, a medium-and-low-income family, or if you are an aborigine, or meet other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	Third, you have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you with the case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	The defendant, do you fully understand your right?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of an adultery case. The accuser Yu-Han Wang filed this case because his husband Edward Takayashi had a relationship beyond co-workers with a woman in the cram school he works in. There were intimate messages between the two of them and the defendant had made up reasons for working long nights. He also tele-conferenced with Rong-Er Huang at midnight. The accuser believed they have a relationship beyond co-workers. The defendant, your wife has accused you of adultery. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然無罪

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s procedure, we will ask both parties the details of the case to confirm whether the defendant and his colleague constituted adultery. Do both parties understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	The accuser, how long have you married your husband? Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	I was married to him four years ago and we don’t have any kids.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	When did your marriage take place? Was it in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met in Taiwan four years ago. He came to Taiwan because he wants to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in the past few years, his job was to teach Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still teaches Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan. His teaching hours can be very low sometimes. Like..the period between jobs is like one to two month. In order to have a stable income, he decided to switch to teaching English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree, does it mean that he want to have a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to get a degree on English-teaching. He found a distance learning program online from California so he can have distance learning instead of taking course in the USA. After he finishes all his courses, he can get a master degree. Therefore, he is able to get a job in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What is his relationship with the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They were colleagues at the same working place. The cram school will partner an English teacher with a Chinese teacher. They were partners.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you assume that they have adultery?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I noticed my husband will often stay at the cram school for long hours. I asked him several times. It was merely an English cram school, why did he need to work for such long hours. He told me he partnered with a Chines teacher and there was a lot to communicate with on teaching programs. I had no doubt with him in the beginning. However, when I found out that he got a lot of calls after he got back home and he would hide to the study room to answer them. So I decided to check his cellphone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything suspicious on his phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, there was a number he often called and answered. So I was curious and I checked his messages and I found out he had been texting this girl for a long time.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even if they text each other, it was merely messages. Or is there any inappropriate messages?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	He is a married man. Why did the woman text him intimate messages? I have provided files to the court previously. The evidence should be in the files.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Check and confirm the evidence used in the case. Investigatory record p.13, are these the messages you sent, defendant?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這是我手機上的簡訊內容。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I am going to ask you some questions based on these messages. The first message was sent on December 12th ,2018 at 9:50 pm. It was sent by the number 0958-932123. The content is「I really miss you, my love」. What does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那封簡訊是我同事傳來的，我記得那時候請了兩天假，她有點擔心我，所以才傳的。我同事在美國受教育所以她思想比較開放，至於我的愛呢，那只是我們對在乎的人的稱呼。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that because your colleague is educated in the US before so she is westernized and has an open mind so my love does not mean anything special?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	對阿，那只是對在乎的人一個常用的稱呼而已。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the “I miss you” part?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我剛剛說的，那時候我請了兩天的假，她自然就打出了那些字阿。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean the reason she sent the message is because at then you took two days off and without your assistance she missed you a lot.

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是阿，內容大致如此，那簡訊沒什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent on December 29th , 2018 at 11:55pm, and it was sent by the same number, the content was “ I want you by my side, when can we be truly together? ” what does this mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳這封訊息來教我怎麼正確表達在我作業上的中文句子。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	She sent the message because she wanted to help you in the assignment? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太告知法院的，要完成碩士學位，我必須修滿三十學分，所以我自然有一些功課要做。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you please explain what the program of your master degree is?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是有關英語教學的，除了教學以外還有些課程和文化跟語言能力有關。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So your master degree was about TESOL and there are some cultural communication programs?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三堂有關文化溝溝通的課程

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What is your homework in those courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這樣的課程會給學生們不同的作業，像我在台灣是要找一個英文教學的工作，為了達到這個目標，我需要證明我中文很好。所以我的作業裡面有很多關於中翻英的句子。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So because you plan to teach English in Taiwan, the homework is to somewhat prove your Chinese ability by giving you assignments on translating sentences?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，同時我也被要求要精進我的口說和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Back to what we mentioned, this is your homework right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，我記得那句。當我看到那些中文句子，我不知道怎麼翻譯成英文，中文字對外國人來說有時候很難理解，所以我就向她尋求幫助，然後再叫她回傳答案給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So you mean you told your colleague the Chinese version of the sentence and she sent it back the English version by messages and it is merely the answer to the homework?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊只是我作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	So back to investigatory file one page 14 to 16, please take a look at those messages. Are they all sent by this colleague because she wanted to help you on your assignment?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的這些簡訊都只是用來解答我的作業而已。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So what is your explanation about your wife accusing you having an affair with your colleague?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太在這事上太小題大作了。我知道她對我並不滿意。從一開始我去修學位時她就沒有給予我任何支持了。如果她能夠表現出一點支持，我就不用向我同事尋求協助了。我認為她應該為這次的誤會負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statements, are there any unhappy events between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	結婚一開始，我們的確相處的不錯，後來她就對我教葡萄牙語這件事非常不快，因為我拿不到穩定的授課時數。我的工作就變成我們之間最主要的問題。我沒辦法讓她明白我的挫折和困難。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	So back to your master degree, when did you start the degree and when did it end?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	這個課程在2015年的秋季開課的。這是個兩年的學程。照理來說我在2017年的五月就該畢業了。可是因為我做兼職的工作，所以我沒辦法好好完成我的那些作業。就像我說的，我太太並沒有很支持我。在我看來，我是獨自完成這個學位而沒有靠她的任何幫忙。我覺得很累也很挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	The program was to study for two years, but you did not. Why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法完成課堂上的所有作業。還有一些課堂上的要求

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	What is the last semester you registered in?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一學期是2017的春季班。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you said the last semester of your registration was in May 2017, but the messages continued seven months later after you should have finished your degree. And why is that?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	儘管我沒有完成我的學位，這也不代表我不想精進我的語言能力，在課程結束後我還是有繼續精進我的中文能力。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	Just like you said, you wanted to keep learning Chinese despite you failed to finish your degree?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的。這就是我向我同事尋求協助的原因。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleague’s role is to be your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不僅是我的家教更是我真心的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有。我原本要給她錢但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why did she still text you at midnight? It is way beyond a colleague’s duty.

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	所以我說她是非常支持我的。她用她私人時間來幫我回答問題。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still working at the cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的，我還在那工作

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	And does this colleague still work there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	她還在那邊工作但我們不在是搭檔關係了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Does the prosecutor wish to subpoena any witness or investigate any ecidence?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope the court to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, Rong-Er Huang, to explain the reasons and the background of those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had took some actions. They have persuaded Rong-Er Huang to leave the job because of her relationship with my husband. I want the cram school to clarify the statement.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate for you? Your lesson should be finished in May 2017. You shouldn’t make up reasons for texting her seven months later. And your messages were all sent in midnights. Do you have any evidence to help you explain the situation?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我沒有什麼證據好提供的。就像我說的，我和我同事之間的關係很簡單。我就是想要精進我的語言能力然後她幫助我。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next proceeding will be on June 24th ,2018 at 4:30 pm. The accuser and the defendant, please be here on time. Both parties can hire a lawyer if necessary.

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白。

en-US	Now I’m going to inform the rights and obligation of the defendant.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	First, you have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民、或符合相關法令規定者，可申請法律協助。
en-US	You have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low-income family, a medium-and-low-income family, or if you are an aborigine or meet other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your right?

zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same with the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we’re here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case and the incident is that the defendant has an affair with the cram school teacher and they often message through the phone and has a telephone-conferencing at midnight and the message is too intimate and the defendant often finds reasons to work too late and he often has an telephone-conferencing with黃蓉兒and this is beyond coworkers’  relationship, so we prosecute the defendant.The defendant, your wife accused you for having an affair with other women. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我無罪阿。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s procedure, we mainly try to understand the detail of the adultery case and do both parties understand today’s procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	I want to ask the accuser first. How long have you been married? How many kids do you have?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	I have been married with my husband for four years and we don’t have any kids.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Then, where did you get married? In Taiwan or in foreign countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	My husband and I met in Taiwan and he came to Taiwan in order to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the past four years, did your husband teach Portuguese all the way?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we met with each other, he was an Portuguese teacher and he continued to teach Portuguese.However, the learning people of Portuguese in Taiwan is not too much and teaching hours is not stable and the job always has a period between jobs.Because the income is not stable, so my husband decided to learn mother tongue and seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that your husband are seeking an advanced degree and does that mean he wants to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because my husband want to teach English in Taiwan, so he want to get a degree about English teaching. He searched for a distant learning program from California in America. He just go for a course of distant learning and meets the qualification that he could get a degree.In this way, he can get a master degree of English learning and after he gets the certificate, then he can teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	 So, what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	Then, his cram school proposed a case about the combination of Chinese and English teaching and my husband partnered with the Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	 My husband always stayed in the cram school for the reasons of the too much working load but I don’t think that the loading is too heavy. They said that they had to communicate with the partner about the teaching course. At first, I didn’t have any suspection for my husband but I observed that after he came back, he always has a phone call and didn’t talk about the content of the phone call and always got to the study room to have a phone call, so I started to suspect of my husband.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So, in the cell phone, do you find something weird?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I found in his phone book they are too many the same number, so I started to check his message and found that they have a lot of messages with each other.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even though they just message to each other, I think it is not too strange. It’s still OK.

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	I think if they don’t have nothing, why did they often send intimate messages to each other and use the intimate words and phrases. He has been married and why did he do that?

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	The defendant, please look at the indictment 1 page 13. There are some messages. Do you send these intimate messages?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這些親密訊息都是在我手機上。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now, I’ m going to ask you some questions based on these intimate messages.The first message happened at 106/12/21 9:50 p.m. and the phone number is 0958-932123 and the message content is “I really miss you, my love.”

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那是我其中一個同事發給我的簡訊。因為我前兩天都加班到很晚，所以她關心我的狀況。我同事是受過美式教育的，所以她是非常的劍潭與開放。那至於這個my love，只是我們之間的一個稱謂而已，其實沒有什麼。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that because your colleague once studied in aboard and her thought is westernized, so the express of the emotion is very open. The phrase ”my love” means nothing, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	對阿!那個my love 就只是我們對彼此的稱呼，其實也沒有什麼，就是西方稱呼彼此都是這樣。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	Then, what’s your explanation about the previous sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，她只是單純擔心我而已。因為我們是同事，工作壓力比較大，她當然會關心我啊!

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that because you have not gone to work for two days and don’t assist with your course, so she sent the message to concern you?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的，那就是訊息的內容阿!沒有什麼其他的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Ok, and the second message was sent at 11:55 p.m. 106/12/29 from the same person and the message was that “I want you by my side, when do we get together?”

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她只是傳這封簡訊來向我詢問說這個句子的意思與表達。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So, do you mean that your colleague sent a message to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太之前說的，我曾經修習英語教學的碩士學位，要30學分才能畢業，常常需要完成一些作業和練習，她只是幫我罷了。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	What do you study in your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是關於英語教學的，那主要是學習英語教學，還有學習語言文化相關，還有語言能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that you get a master degree of English teaching and the course is combined with some culture communication?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得有三門關於文化溝通的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So, what kind of assignment do the culture communication courses often assign?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這個跨文化溝通的課程其實是非常的不一樣的。像我就是要尋找一個英語教學的職位，那我必須要對於中文有非常好的造詣。因此，我的作業很多都是關於英中翻譯的。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that because you want to teach Chinese in Taiwan, so you have to finish the English courses about culture communication and the assignment is always about English-Chinese translation?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，我也必須要常常精進我的寫作與口說能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s get back to the sentence…

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對的，因為我對於中文其實沒有很了解，所以我就傳了中文句子給我同事，請她幫我翻譯，然後她把中文翻好之後再用英文傳過來。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that the assignment you sent some Chinese sentence to your colleague and your colleague sent back the English translation? In other words, is that the answer of the translation?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那個簡訊就是那個中文句子的翻譯解答。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	The defendant, please look at the indictment 1 page 14-16 and please quickly browse these messages and I want to ask you that are these messages is all about the assignment?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊的傳送都是為了幫助我完成作業?

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So, your wife accused you for the adultery and what’s your explanation about this?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	關於這件事，我覺得我老婆想太多了。她認為我沒有能力支持家庭，而且她在我學習的時候，我老婆也從來沒有對我有任何幫助阿。因為在我就讀碩士時候，其實她沒有給我什麼幫助。那假設她能給予我幫助的話，就是不用傳那麼多訊息去尋求幫助了，所以我覺得她應該被這件事被譴責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to the sentence from both parties, I think that your married life is not too good.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們感情的初期，其實是過的有點苦，特別是在我尋求葡萄牙文的工作時候，因為當時後收入不是很穩定。因此，我老婆對於我工作不穩定其實不諒解，我們常常因為此事而吵架。我老婆甚至沒有體諒我所遇到的挫折及遇到的困難。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	OK, let’s get back to the master degree. When did you start your master degree and when did you finish? Did you get a degree?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	這個碩士學位是從2015年的四月開始。原本預計是2017年五月會取得學位，但是因為其實在過程中很少有時間去認真完成作業，所以最後還是還沒有得到學位。就像我說的，我的太太在我的求學過程中，其實沒有給我任何幫助，所以我一直都是孤單一個人去追尋我的夢想，努力取得學位，所以我非常的疲累與挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So, do you mean that your master is long for two years and you didn’t finish, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	因為我沒辦法完成所有的作業，而且還有一些課程上的要求也沒有達成。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	Then, what's the date of the last registration?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	上一次最後註冊日期是2107年...

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you said, the courses ended at in 2017/05 and the learning should not be continued to July, then why do you still send the messages in July?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	雖然碩士學位已經結束了，但是我還是非常積極的學中文，所以在那之後，我還是持續的學習中文，而且也非常努力的研讀。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that after the program, you still want to learn Chinese, so you study very hard alone, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，這也就是為什麼我會尋求同事的幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So, in other words, your colleague played the role like your tutor, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	對我來說，她不只是一位家教，也是一位很好的朋友?

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Then, do you pay to her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	並沒有，其實我有想要給她錢，但是她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn't pay to her, why did she still passionate to send these messages? Isn't it clear?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	所以就是我說因為她非常支持我，所以她願意花自己的時間來教我啊。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的，我還在那工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So, does the colleague still work there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是的，她還在那邊工作，但是我們已經沒有任何課程方面的合作了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any further to add or search for more information?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	My honor, I want to ask the colleague of the defendant, also黃蓉兒from美而美 cram school and talks about the purpose of the messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, do you have something needs our assistance to investigat

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	 I have heard the美而美cram school once took action about the two person, so I want to ask about the evidence form the cram school.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want us to investigate?The defendant, since the master degree ended at 2017/05 but after that, you and黃蓉兒still have many interaciton and even after 9 p.m., you and黃蓉兒still send messages, so do you have any evidence want to search about this?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	關於這件事，其實我沒有什麼證據能夠提供的。就像我說的，我只是單純因為修習英語教學碩士學位的文化溝通的課程，我只是想要改進我的英文能力。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next procedure is at 2:30 p.m., 2017/06/24 and please the defendant and the accuser come to the court. Both parties can hire a lawyer.

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	 I understand

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	I am going to read you your right.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	You have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民、或符合相關法令規定者，可申請法律協助。
en-US	You have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low-income family, a medium-and-low income family, or if you are an aborigine, or meet other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance. 

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	You have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which can help you with your case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Does the defendant fully understand your right?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解。

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please describe the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure for love affair. Yu-han Wang filed the suit because her husband with his colleagues has some imitate messages with each other, and her husband often has some regular contact with his colleague Ron-er Huang. The defendant, your wife is going to suit you, and what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯，當然。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, we are going to see the details of the messages and to decide whether the detail is enough to make the case. Do both parties understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	The accuser, how long you married with your husband? Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We’ve married for 4 years. We have no children.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Did you marry in Taiwan, or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met with my husband in Taiwan, and he came to Taiwan here because he taught Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So he taught the language is always?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	After our marriage, he kept teaching language as a language teacher. He keeps teaching. But the language is not frequent in Taiwan, so he had no steady class. Often there’s one or two months no class for him. In order to make income steady, he decided to teach English, but English is actually not his mother tongue, so he decided to go to English class.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mean the course, does it mean the degree?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wants to teach in Taiwan, so the degree he wants to get is about teaching English. The file for the America California is far distance course that allowed him to have the course from the far distance. After he gets the credit, he will get the master degree. And after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship between him and this love affair object.

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues in a cram school. The cram school has Chinese teacher and English teacher at the same class, and the one in this love affair is the Chinese teacher in the class.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know they have love affairs?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At the first I discover my husband stayed in the school for a long time. I wonder that is only an English cram school, why did he have to stay there for long, and he answered he had to communicate with Chinese teacher. At first I didn’t doubt him, but I found there are some phone calls to home and he always answered when I wasn’t there and he even answered phone at the study.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	When you checked the phone, did you find anything strange?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I found a regular number in his phone, so I checked the email and I found there are many emails about the colleagues that almost contact each other every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	It seems common for the message, is that strange in the content in the message?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If this is only a common message, that’s OK. But there are often some strange words and imitate words in the message. I have filed it to the court, that should be in the file there

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	The exhibit 13, there is the content of the message. The defendant, is it from your message?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這是我手機的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	I am going to request you from these messages. The first message is at 21:50 on 21st December, 2017. The number is 0958-932123. The content is “I really miss you, my love”, and what does it mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那封信是我同事傳給我的，我記得那時候我請了兩天假，她很擔心我，所以才傳了這封簡訊來。我的同事是接受美國教育，心胸非常開闊，那只不過是她講話的一種方式來表述自己想要表達的。「my love」只不過是一個我們對於一個在乎人所用的用法。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	The messenger is from the US and her way to speak is so open, so ‘my love’ means nothing, is it right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	對啊，那根本就沒有代表什麼，它只不過就是互相表達關心的詞而已。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the former sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	正如我前面所說的，我沒去上班的兩天，她很想我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean she just wanted to express her concern because of your two days off. And she needed your help from class so she misses you. Only this?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是啊，就這樣而已，那簡訊根本就沒什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second exhibit, the message at 23:55 on December 29th 2017 from the same phone, the content is ‘I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?’ and why did she send the message?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳那封簡訊是想回答我那句中文是什麼意思

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean she send this message it do the homework, and what does it mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	在我老婆告我之前，我還有13個學分要拿，要拿到這13個學分我才能取得碩士學位，所以我還有作業和練習題要做

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you explain first what did you study for the mast degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士課程大部分是英文課程，還有一些文化課程和能力課程。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	You mean the degree you get is for English teaching but there are other culture and communication courses

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是啊，我記得至少有3堂是文化與溝通的課程。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what the assignment did they give you in the culture and communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這門課文化與溝通的課程每個學生的作業都不太一樣，像我是待台灣，我就必須要證明我可以精準的駕馭中文，還有我的中文能力這樣子。因此我中文很多都是中英翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean because you have to teach Taiwanese English so you have to prove your Chinese ability so there are a lot of Chinese and English assignments for you, is it?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是啊，我的確有必要去精進我的口說和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So is it your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	中文字對我來說就是有幾個字很難辨認，所以我就寄了這封簡訊給她，請她翻譯過來。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean this message is only the answer of the assignment. You sent the Chinese words to her and she brought the Chinese answer to you, is that right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊就只是我作業的解答而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	The exhibit 1, page 14 to 16, are these all the answers to your assignments? You sent them because your assignment?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊全部都是作業要用的。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	How do you explain about the love affair your wife filed

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得我太太真的是想太多了，我知道她覺得我沒有能力撫養家庭。因為他都不支持我這個碩士學位，所以我只好問我同事，如果她肯支持我一點，我就不用問我同事了，我覺得她必須為這整個誤會負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you said, is that any unpleasant situations between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們一開始還不錯，但可能是教葡萄牙語的關係，可能就…。自從開始教葡萄牙語，工作的關係就一直起爭執，她覺得我都一直沒有盡我的力去工作，但其實我經常遇到挫折，我都沒辦法跟她說

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Back to what you said about the master degree, when did the master degree begin, and has it finished and do you get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2015開始，預計2017年結束，但因為我一直有在兼職，所以我一直無法完成我的碩士課程。就像我說的，我太太一點都不支持我，我必須獨力完成這個學位，我覺得很累很挫折挫敗。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean the degree is for 2 years, but you didn’t fish it, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成所有課程作業，還有一些課程必修。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So the registration for the semester, when did it end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是2017年的春季。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If you said is true, you mean the last registration is last until May 2107, and there will not be any assignments for you, but the messages between you and your colleague remained 7 months afterwards, could you explain why?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒能完成我的學位，並不代表我不想繼續精進我的中文能力，為了繼續精進中文能力，所以我一直有在試圖傳簡訊增進中文。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean even though you didn’t finish the master degree, you still want to improve your Chinese ability and make your Chinese fluent more, is it right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	那就是我問我同事的目的，希望她幫我。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the colleague plays the role of a house teacher for you?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，還是我的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我想要付，但她婉拒。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t her, why did she send the messages in the middle of the night? Doesn’t that exceed the relationship between you and the colleague?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這就是我說她為什麼總是這麼支持我，用盡所有的時間來教我中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still teaching in that school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的，我還繼續在那邊上班。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is this colleague working there, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	她也繼續在在那邊教書，但我們不再是一個團隊了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	 Prosecutor, is there any witness you want to subpoena or you want to investigate something?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena Ron-er Huang, the colleague from Mei-er-Mi cram school as a witness and asked her about the relationship with the man and the purpose to send the message.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, do you have anything you want the court to investigate.

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that school have taken action for the relationship between my husband and Ron-er Huang. I want this investigation.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you want the court to investigate something for you? Now your master degree ended at June, 2017, you didn’t have any reason to send these messages with your colleagues. That’s really strange and especially these messages sent from your colleague were mostly sent after 9 pm, do you anything you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我沒有想到什麼法院可以為我調查的證據，我只是像要加強我的中文能力罷了。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court is set at 4:30 pm on June 24th, 2018 and to subpoena the witness. The accuser and defendant have to be there. Both of you can have a lawyer.

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白。

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	Now I’m going inform the defendant’s right.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	First, you have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民、或符合相關法令規定者，可申請法律協助。
en-US	Second, you have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low-income family, a medium-and-low-income family, or if you are an aborigine or meet other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we’re here for the preparation procedure for an adultery case. The accuser 宇涵王, she claimed that her husband… has an affair… her husband Edward Kapayashi has an affair with his coworker in his cram school. The accuser found some intimate messages in her husband cell phone, and all that messages showed her husband has more than… a relationship more than a coworker with her colleagues… and her husband often make up reasons for another worktime… and tele-conferencing in dark night. The defendant, your wife filed the lawsuit on you for adultery. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我完全是無罪的。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparation procedure, the court will investigate the details in the messages from your cell phone and we will consider that the messages are enough to constitute an adultery. And we will ask questions of you two. Do you both understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	The accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have any child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years. We don’t have any child.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Are you married in Taiwan? Or other place?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan four years ago. He came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the past years, did he work as an Portuguese teacher?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	The time we met, he was an Portuguese teacher, and now he’s still teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese in Taiwan is not popular with people, so his teaching-hours are often not stable. (yeah… not stable… from one to two hours per week…) After that in order to make his income more stable, so he decided to teach English as well. But English is not his mother tongue, so he tried to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just said that (X2) he wanted to… your husband wanted to seek an advanced degree. That means get an degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, I mean he wants to… teach English, so the degree he needs is about a teaching qualification. My husband found a distance learning program on-line and it is a program from California, the United States. And the program provides on-line learning so that he doesn’t need to go to the USA and he can learn English on teaching… for teaching. After he finished his class, got his… all the credits he needs, he can… could obtain the master degree in the USA, and he can use the degree to teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then, the relationship between your husband and the person he has affair with… what is the relationship?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are coworkers in a cram school. The cram school… the class in the cram school needs a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher to teach English together. The affair person is the Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I often ask my husband why did he always stay up late in the cram school. It’s just an English class. There’s no need for staying up late in the cram school, but my husband told me that he had something to discuss with his Chinese teacher… for teaching. I did not… doubt my husband at first, but days pass… days has passed, my husband would get some calls in our home after getting off the cram school, and he will answer the phone into… in his study room so I have no choice but to doubt him.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything inordinary stuffs… messages?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	There is a same num… a very same number in his phone record so I checked my husband cell phone’s messages, and I found that my husband chatted with the woman very often.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	It just… they are just text messages. Anything not okay?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If they are some work stuff messages, that’s okay. I found very intimate words the woman used to text in the message, and my husband is married with me, you know, so that’s quite not okay.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please display the exhibit file on page 13. The accuser, are these your… the messages you said…

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這就是…這些是我手機上的訊息。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Well then I am going to ask you some questions about these messages. The first message was sent at 09:50 p.m. on December 21st, 2017 from the cell phone number 0958-932123, and the message said, “I miss you, my love”, what do you want to say?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那只是我同事發給我的訊息啊。我記得我那時候剛好放了兩天假，我同事就只是關心我而已啊。我同事在美國讀書然後畢業…在美國接受教育的，所以她的思想相對也是開放許多。我們就…平常打打鬧鬧的…我們對於在乎的人會說my love這樣。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that your coworker is westernized on his… her thoughts and her expression for feelings because she got the education in the US, so “my love” is nothing special?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	沒錯，那就只是…對於在乎的人所傳達的關心方式，真的沒有什麼。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the previous sentence… in the message?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，我們就是同事。然後她很…比較擔心我一點，因為我兩天都沒去上班去放假這樣。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that… your coworker she is quite… she missed you because you have two day-off and there is no assistance on teaching…

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	對，訊息的內容就是這樣，它的意思也是這樣。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent from the same… the exact same number at 11:55 p.m. on December 29th, 2017. The content is… writes as when can she be with you… “I want you so bad…”

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她這樣說只是為了告訴我，我在…我的一個…我剛剛寫到一個中文的作業要怎樣表達這樣…要怎樣表達一個豐富情感的句子。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You saying that she sent you the message to help you on your assignment...? What are you talking about?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像之前…先前我老婆跟你們講的…我太太跟你們講的，我正在攻讀一個英語教學的碩士學位，而我需要30個學分才可以完成這個學位，所以在這之前有一些習作也是很正常的。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you first explain your… what exactly you are preparing for the degree.

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的學位是有關TESOL這個英語教學的系統…然後裡面除了英語教學外，也有一些文化相關的課程…或是語言能力相關的課程。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So, the program you take needs not… has not only TESOL or… and courses about culture…communication…

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
en-US	對啊，有至少三個是有關文化溝通的課程。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
zh-TW	What kind of assignment the courses will need you to complete?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這些文化溝通的課程對每個人來說…每個人選的都有點不同，像我現在住在台灣，而且我準備要來教英文，所以我會需要這個…會需要一些能力在中文上。所以囉，我的一些作業就是有關中英翻譯的一些句子。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So, according to your words, the program you need… and you need to translate some sentences between Chinese and English, right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對，我也需要精進我的閱讀跟寫作的能力在中文方面。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s get back to the sentence. It is one of your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是啊，我讀到了一些句子，可是你也知道有一些中文字對外國人來說就是比較難理解，所以我請我的同事翻譯給我…翻譯成英文給我，讓我去明白句子的意思。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Well, you are telling me that you ask your coworker to translate the sentence into English… from Chinese to English for you, and that is the answer… and then send text message to you as the answer for your exercises?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，那個就只是我功課的…那個訊息就只是我功課的解答。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	The defendant, we will go on to show you the file on page… the exhibit on page 14 to 16. So these are all part of your homework, right?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯，這些所有看到的句子都是在幫助我完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then, in terms of the affair your wife accused you, what’s your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	對此，我真的是覺得我太太真的是想太多了，我真的沒有做什麼。而且我也只是想讓自己可以更支持這個家這樣。而且庭上，請你知道，我在進修的時候我太太是完全沒給任何精神支持的。我太太真的是沒有幫助我太多，如果她能對於我在進修這件…進修英文這件事上，提供更多的協助的話，我也就不需要拜託我的同事來協助我，她才是那個需要被責怪的人。而且還造成這些誤解，真的很抱歉。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your words, there’s… there seems to be unpleasure… unhappiness between you and your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們剛…結婚沒多久的時候，我們都還…相處地都還很愉快很融洽，可是我的工作就是很不穩定，尤其在授課時數方面，因為真的沒什麼人要學葡萄牙文。所以漸漸地我們常為了我的工作而爭吵，我老婆都不知道我做了多少努力在想要去好好地維持這份工作上，而她也完全不知道我有多挫敗在遭遇了這些失敗上。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s get back to your program. When did it start? When did it end? (Do you know? And can you tell us?)

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2015年秋天開始了…開始去參與這個課程，它是個兩年期的課程。原本預計是在2017年5月會結束，可是我陸陸續續地在打工啊什麼的，所以我也是沒有完成這個學位這樣。就像我說的，我太太在對於我…進修英文這方面真的是沒有給予很大的支持，日子久了我也就感到很疲倦因為讓我覺得我是自己在奮鬥的這樣子，我真的很灰心。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You’re saying that the course is a two-year course. But why did you… didn’t you accomplish it? 

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	因為我沒辦法完成所有課程的作業。還有一些課程相關的規定。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So when is the last semester of your registration?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是在2017年的春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	We know that your course ended in May 2017, then after this… after all of this, why… why those messages can… will show up in your text messages record…

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	就算我沒辦法完成我的學業，也不代表我不想要精進我的中文能力。所以我為了更精進它，所以我就是自己繼續學下去這樣。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	According to that, even if you did not finish the course, you still want to make progress in your Chinese, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	對啊，這就是為什麼我才要向我同事尋求協助。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	Well, the role your coworker play is kind of tutor of your Chinese?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不僅僅是我的中文家教，她真的是一個很好的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay her for the tutor?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有…我有試著要付錢給她，可是她說不用。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	Well, you didn’t pay her. But why did she text you in such night… That is telling that you are beyond coworkers’ relationships?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	所以囉，我說，她真的是很幫助我的一個朋友。尤其花了…犧牲了她那些時間來幫助我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still work as an English teacher in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	對，我依然在那裏就職。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So do your coworker?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	她依然在那邊上班，但我們已經不再是教學的夥伴了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, any more witness or any further evidence needed to be investigate?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	Your honor, I would like to subpoena the defendant’s coworker 蓉兒黃 at his 美而美 cram school. I would like to ask her about the detail and the intention about those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, anything you want… is there anything you want the court to investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has take some… has taken action for the incident my husband and his coworker… and I even heard that the cram school asked his coworker to step out of the work.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	And the defendant, is there anything you want the court to help you investigate? It is a fact that the defendant your course is… your courses ended May 2017, so there’s no need about the assignment stuff you need to deal with, and that makes those messages quite dubious because you received them in the really night and that is quite out of control.

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我真的沒有什麼證據想要法院為我調查。就…一直都像我說的，我跟她會聊天，真的是單純就是我想精進我的中文，因為我真的想繼續學它這樣。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So the next court is set on… at 04:30 p.m. on June 24th, 2018. The court will ask some questions from the witness, and both the accuser and the defendant need to come to the court and both of you can hire a lawyer.

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白。

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？

zh-TW	是的，我了解

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Proce…prosecutor please state the case

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the adultery case. The plaintiff, Yu Han Wang, he sued his husband Edward for that he had a…he had an affair with his colleague in a cram school, 王柔兒, they not only have intimate message, and…but also Edward usually make up reasons for having extra work; moreover, they also have tele-conferencing, and their relationship is beyond coworker’s relationship. Also, 王宇涵 has collected some advance that… point out 王柔兒 and Edward has constitute in the adultery. The defendant, your wife is suspecting that you have an affair. What do you want to say?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我認為無罪

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparation procedure, we will mainly focus on their…the message between the…defendant and 王柔兒, and to see if their behavior constitute in…the adultery crime. Does the both parties understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Now I am going to ask the plaintiff. How long have you married with your husband. Do you have any children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	I have been married with my husband and…for four years, and we don’t have any children.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	And did you married in Taiwan or in other countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met with my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in these years, does he…did  he teach Portuguese as his work?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. And after we got married, he continues to teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hour is not steady, and sometime his…he had a period between jobs for about one or two months.  Because teaching Portuguese is not a steady work, he decided to teach English, and because his mother tongue is not English, he went to seek an advance degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that he… seek an advance degree. Do you mean that he had…studied for a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he needs a degree in English teaching. He..he had a distance learning program which is from California in the United States, and…and the learning is a distance online learning, so he can learn…he can learn in Taiwan, and also…therefore, through the credits from the online program, he can get the master degree in English teaching, and then he can teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then what is the relationship between your husband and the so call affair…the person he had affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleague. They…they work in a same cram school, and the cram had a program to have a foreign teacher and a Taiwanese teacher and to be partner with teaching, and she is the person who partner with him.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, my husband usually make up reasons for having extra work and stay in the cram school. I asked him for the reason, and he said that he has to communicate with the Taiwanese teacher to talk more about their work. But I think he’s just a English teacher, why he have to stay in the cram school for so long. At first, I didn’t suspect him, but he started to have some phone calls after his work, and moreover, when he pick up the calls, he would avoid me and went to the study room. And I started to suspect him and check up his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So did you find anything wrong with his cell phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I check his phone call record and saw that he almost had phone call with the same person every day. And then I check his text…I check his message and see that he text with the same person with a woman almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	I think texting people is not a very unusual thing. So is there anything wrong with the messages.

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	I think the message with ordinary content is fine. But he is a man…but he had got married, and how can he have message with some intimate content with other people. I had provided some information about their message, and I think all the evidence are in the files.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	So the…so the file and is the message you mean on the phone call text?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這些就是我手機上的內容。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I am going to ask you based on these…these contents. The first message is…was sent from the cell phone 0958-932123 on 21:50…at 21:50 on 12/21 in 2017, and the content is “I really miss you”. What does this mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	痾那就只是同事寄給我的簡信。那個時候我剛請了兩天假，他很擔心，所以才寄這樣的簡訊給我。我的同事他之前在美國讀過書，所以她的表達方式也比較開放，這就是他說話的方式，就像是說「我的愛」這樣子，這都是很正常的表達方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that because this person has stayed in the foreign countries and his…her concept is westernized, so…her expression is just this kind of opened,  and it’s very ordinary and this is nothing wrong with her words, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	對，那就只是普通…那種表達方式很普通，就只是好朋友或是很親密的朋友間的表達方式。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	So what about the sentence he sent you…she sent you?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，我們是同事，在我…在我請了兩天假之後，他當然會很想念我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So do you mean that the other party sent you this message is just because you are out of work for two days, and he miss you and he miss you because she work without your assistance in class, right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的，那個簡訊內容並沒有甚麼問題。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	And let’s see the second message. That’s from the same person’s cell phone and the time was at 23:55 on12/29,2017, and message content is 我很想要你在我身邊，你甚麼時候可以在我身邊呢? I…So what do you think about this message. What does it mean? 

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他會寄給我那封簡訊是因為他想教我要怎麼表達這樣子的意思。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you mean that the reason why she sent you this message was because she wanted to help you with your assignment? What does it mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就如同我老婆之前在法庭上說的，我有一個碩士學位的一個計劃，在那個計劃裡我要…需要拿到三十個學分，這就是拿到學分的其中一個作業，他只是協助我完成這個作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	So please explain what master degree are you…did you get?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是英語教學，然後他有一部份是關於英文，另外一部份是關於文化還有語言能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that the master degree you get was TESOL, and it includes some language competence ability, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的。我記得至少三堂課是跟文化還有語言能力有關溝通…能力有關。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what was the assignment in the…in the cultural and communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這些文化溝通課程出的作業是因人而異的，像我是一個在台灣然後想要在台灣能夠教英文的人，我的作業就要去展現出我對中文有多麼了解。所以我的作業有很多都是關於中英的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So you mean that because you wanted to teach English in Taiwan, your assignments from the master degree is usually about translating the sentences between Chinese and English, and your assignments was to finish these translation and to…and to express how well you did in Chinese.

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，除此之外，我還必須展現我的… 精進我的閱讀跟寫作能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Ok, let’s get back to the message, so you mean the message is your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，那就是我的作業。你知道有的時候中文字對外國人來說是很困難的，所以我寄給她…所以我寄給她那句話請她幫我翻譯。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So you mean you sent her the sentence in English and she sent you back the sentence in Chinese and…and the sentence is just the answer of your assignment, is that right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊就只是我作業的解答。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Ok, let’s see the… show the page 14 to 16 on file one and check the message content…contents, and are these messages all the answer about your…all the answer to your assignment?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊都是為了完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	How do you explain to your wife’s…to your wife’s words that she said you have an affair with your colleague?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得我太太想太多了，我覺得他只是不滿意我在這個家庭裡面的付出，但是在我一開始學習的時候他也沒有給我任何的支持或支援。他在我拿到…他在我拿碩士學位的過程中，也並沒有展現要支持我的意思，這也是為甚麼我要轉而尋求我同事的協助，那都是因為他根本就不支持我，我覺得他應該為這件事情負責

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your words, is there anything wrong with your relationship between your wife and you?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們一開始剛結婚的時候，我們的確相處得很好，但是後來因為我工作的關係，我一開始沒有辦法有穩定的工作時數。因此，工作這件事情就成為我們爭吵的主要原因，我們為了這件事情已經爭吵了非常多次，我也覺得很沮喪，但是也沒有甚麼發洩的方法。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Ok, let’s get back to the…your master degree. When did you started to study for the master degree, and when…when did you get this degree?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2015秋天的時候開始這個碩士學位課程，並且本應要在2017年的五月拿到學位，但是因為我…並且本來應該…並且這是一個兩年課程，我本來應要在2017年的五月拿到學位，但是因為我自己還有申請其他工作，所以就沒有足夠的時間完成這個學位。就像我說的，我太太在這件事情上面並沒有很支持我，所以就變成好像是我一個人在完成這件事情，讓我覺得很累，讓我很累也很沮喪。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So you mean the degree…the program is two years and you didn’t finish it on time, so what is the reason?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	因為我並沒有完成所有的課程的作業。還有一些課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So when was the last semester that you registered?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我最後一個有註冊的學期是2017年的春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So you mean that you have finish your… study program on…in May in 2017 but you continue to text your colleague for over 7 months after your study, so what is the reason?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒有完成這個學位，但是也並不代表說我就沒有再繼續學習了，雖然我沒有完成學位，但是我還是想要去精進我的語言，所以我才會在停止這個學習計畫之後，繼續跟我同事詢問相關的。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that even if you didn’t finish the program, you still continue to keep studying Chinese and wanted to make your Chinese more influent, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是，那就是我為甚麼跟我同事尋求幫助。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the position of your colleague is just like your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不僅是像家教一樣，還是我的非常好的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Then did you paid her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	不，我想要付給她錢，但是他拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If…if you didn’t pay her, then why did she answer your message at midnight at such a time that people should go to bed? I think the relationship is beyond the…an ordinary period.

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這就是我說的他非常的支持我，然後也是我非常好的朋友，而且他都用自己的時間來幫助我。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	So are you teaching English in the same cram school.

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是，我還在那邊工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does this colleague still working there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	他還在那邊繼續工作，但是我們並沒有在一起搭檔。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you need to have any people here, or you want to see any evidence?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to have 王柔兒, who is the colleague work with the defendant in 美而美cram school, to be here to explain the messages and the relationship between the defendant and her.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The plaintiff, do you need anything the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that 美而美 cram school took some action to this… and they even try to persuade the 王柔兒to quit her job. I want to check if this thing is true or false. 

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you need anything the court to investigate for you? The situation is that you have already finish your… finish the program in May in 2017, and you… keep on having messages with 王柔兒and almost the messages are after 9 p.m. at night, and it’s really not an ordinary situation. So what… evidence can you offer to the court to help yourself?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我沒有任何法庭...需要法庭來幫我調查的事情，但是就像我所說的，我只是想要精進自己的中文能力，然後跟我的同事也只是非常單純的關係。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	We are going to have the next court at 4:30 p.m. on 6/24 in 2018. And we will have the witness here, and we need the plaintiff and the defendant both of you be here, and both of you have the right to the lawyer. Do you understand?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	Today we are here for an adultery case, case number 2345. The preparatory procedure.

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯______，中華民國107年5月21日。」

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	Now I’m going to announce the defendant his rights and obligations.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	First, the defendant has the right to remain silent and does not have to make any statement against his will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民、或符合相關法令規定者，可申請法律協助。
en-US	Second, the defendant has the right to a lawyer. If the defendant comes from a low income family, a medium income…family, a medium-and-low-income family, or if…the defendant is an aborigine or meets other qualifications set by the law, the defendant may ask the court for legal assiatance.

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	Third, the defendant has the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help him with his case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Does the defendant fully understand his rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是，我明白了。

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	The defendant, you have been prosecuted of ……an adultery case, and today is the preparatory procedure. The accuser, Yu-Han Wang, filed the lawsuit because…he, she found her husband, Edward Takayashi, was ……too, close to his co-worker, which was, ugh …Rong-Er Huang in…the working place. And Edward Takayashi, the …defendant, umm …… often …make up reasons for working for extra time, and the accuser found in the defendant’s cellphone that there are some intimate messages with this Rong-Er Huang. And the accuser think that they are beyond the co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, she filed this lawsuit.The defendant, your wife ……suspected that you …have an adultery, you have an …you have an affair with others. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪，答辯。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s procedure, ugh …the main goal is to …investigate …the message between the defendant and his co-worker. Do you both …do both party understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白了。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	The accuser, how long …ugh, was your marriage with your husband? Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	Ugh we have been married for four years, and we don’t have a child

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	And ……are you married in Taiwan, or you get married in foreign countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan, and he want to taught Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the past few years, ugh his work in Taiwan is to teach Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, ugh he was a Protu …Portuguese teacher. And …ugh after we get married …we got married, ugh… he kept teaching Portuguese.Ugh because there are not very ……very much person in Taiwan want to learn Portuguese, so ugh his teaching hours were not very stable, sometimes umm …there are only few hours, and …umm even one or two months.And …ugh in order to let his income more stable, he started to want to teach English. However, English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he …want to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean that he want to …earn another degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, I mean ugh because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan. So, ugh his degree must be somehow related to English teaching,Ugh he found a distance learning program on the Internet, which ugh …was provided by …umm California in American …America. So therefore, he didn’t have to go out, then he can ugh …he can a..a..achieve his learning through the distance learning.So after he …finished …all his …umm …scores and umm …lessens, he would get his …a master degree, so he didn’t need to go to the United States, but he can get his degree and teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then what is the relationship between your husband and the person he  had an affair with this time?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in the cram school. And ugh that cram school, umm… has, ugh …required ugh …all the teachers partner with another one, to ugh make a Chinese teacher partner with a foreign teacher, And that person was his Chinese teacher in his class.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I just found that my husband …ugh often worked for extra hours, so I asked him that ugh, “It was just an American cram school, so why did you work for extra hours that often?” He said that ugh because they have to work with a Chinese teacher so there are many things to communicate.I didn’t suspect him in the very beginning. However, I started to ……umm discover that after he went home, he often picked up phones. And there are many phone calls for him. And when he answered those phones, he didn’t ugh answer them in my front, he often go into his study room to answer those phones. So I started to be confused. So I checked his phone message.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything you think is not normal in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	Umm ……it is ugh …phone records, ugh … there are not ugh … there are not anything …anything …unnormal. Therefore I checked his umm text message, and found out that he often text with another person …another woman, and always umm …almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even if he sent text message, it’s quite alright …right? Or …if the contents in the messages is not proper?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If the message …the text messages are just something normal, I won’t be like …like this. However, ugh …his was a married man, so why …ugh did the woman send some very intimate words to him? I think I have provided some of his text message in …ugh, to the court. And there are …I think there are in the files.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Exhibit hasten …evidence one. Page 13. And here is …some text message …ugh the contents of some text messages. Ugh may the defendant check if this message is in your cellphone.

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是，這是我寄過的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Well, then I want to ask some questions …umm ……toward these messages.The first message was sent at …ugh, 9:50 PM on December 21st, 2017, and it was sent by a phone number, 0958932123, to your phone. And the content is “我真的好想你呀，我的愛人。” What does this mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那是我一個同事寄給我的訊息。我記得那時候我請了兩天假，那就是為什麼她寄這封簡訊給我。我同事是受美國教育的，所以她的個性非常的開放，她講話都是這樣。然後至於那個「my love」，那只是我們互稱我們關心的人的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Ugh so you mean that this colleague was westernized, so ……her expressions are open-minded, so umm …you don’t think this message is not proper, right? Is that true?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	沒有。這只是一個非常一般朋友打招呼的方式。我們對關心的人、朋友，就是這樣。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	Then how about ……the forward line?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	我已經說過了。我們是同事，我們在那家補習班是搭檔。那時候我請了兩天假，所以當然，她…她會想我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Did you say that because you took a two-days off, so without your …ugh help in her class, she ……was quite missing you. Is that right? Is that only …is that the only thing? Is that simply like that?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	對，我就是這樣說的。那個簡訊…就只是這樣而已，沒什麼大不了。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Okay, so …the second message. It was sent at, ugh 11:55 PM on December 29th, 2017 from the same phone number. And the ……context was, ”I want you by my …ugh, 我想要你在我身邊，我們什麼時候才能真正地在一起？” What does this mean this time?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她是想要幫助我寫這個句子，因為我那時候在寫一個中文的功課。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Did you say that ……ugh, the …ugh this person sent you this message because she wanted to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	我妻子剛剛也在…呃…她的……她被問問題的時候說過了。我正在修一個碩士學程，呃，為了要修完這個學程，我必須要修滿30個學分。所以我當然有一些作業要做。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Would you please explain first that ho …ugh what is your major for the master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是英語教學。嗯，那個碩士學位，呃有一些部分是跟英語教學有關，其他部分跟文化和語言能力有關。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	Ugh, so your master degree is TESOL, however, there are something in that related to culture and language competence. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是，我記得有三堂課跟文化與溝通有關。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	Then about this kind of courses related to culture and communication, ugh what assignments would these courses, ugh, required you to ……achieve? to complete?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	呃，這種文化與溝通課程給每個人的作業都不太一樣。就舉我自己的例子而言，因為我是一個在台灣的外國人，然後想要，嗯…在台灣得到…可以、可以教英文的能力，所以我必須要表現出我對中文的…掌握能力。所以我很多的作業都是跟中英翻譯有關。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Well, you mean that because you plan to teach English in Taiwan. So umm … these courses ugh … required you to complete some assignments, and these assignments are related to Chinese and English sentences translation. Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的。另外我也要精進自己的口說和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay then let’s go back to ……the text … the text message. Did you say that this …is …your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我記得那時候我看到這個句子的時候，我不是很能理解它到底在寫什麼。你也知道的，對外國人來說，中文字有一些非常地難以閱讀、難以辨認，所以我就給我的同事看了這個句子，然後請她告訴我這句話用英文怎麼說，並把它打成簡訊寄給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that, ugh…because you asked your co-worker to …told you the answer of this sentence …the translation of this sentence and send you a text message to, ugh …for the answer, so this message was simply the answer of your assignment? Is that right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那條簡訊只是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Okay then let’s ugh …take a look at exhibit evidence one, page 14, the text messages contexts. Could you …ugh …take a look at those contents? Are they all …related to your assignment? Are these all because of ugh …you need the answers for your assignment? So you sent these messages?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯，全部的簡訊都只是為了要完成作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then ugh …according to what your wife just said that you had an affair with another person, do you have anything to say?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	呃，對這件事，我認為我的妻子想太多了。我知道她一直對我無法支持這個家庭經濟的能力感到失望、不滿；但我想說的是，從我開始上這、這、這個課程到現在，我的妻子也沒有提供我任何幫…任何支持。她從來都沒有…表現出支持我的樣子，對於我念碩士這一件事情。那就是為什麼我會尋求我的同事幫助我做作業。如果她可以多一…表現出多一點點支持，我可能就不會尋求我同事了。我認為，關於這件事情，她應該要受到責備。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you just said, you and your wife seem to be not ugh …very …accordance in your getting along with?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們剛結婚的時候，我們確實滿快樂的。但後來出現了問題，而這問題就是關於我的工作。因為我想在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是這份工作又不太穩定。於是後來這件事情就變成我們之間的問題。我們常常為了這個吵架，她不相信我已經盡我最大的努力，所以…我也沒有讓她知道我所面臨的艱難處境以及…困難的狀況。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Well, okay. Then let’s go back to …ugh, the master …courses you …just mentioned …about. So did you finish your master courses, all of your credits? Did you get the master degree?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	這個碩士是從2015年的秋天開始的。然後它是一個兩年的碩士學位，所以我應該要在2017年的5月完成這個學位。但是我並沒有完成。因為我又開始做一些兼職工作，所以我一直沒有時間可以好好地完成我的作業。就像我剛所說的，我的太太並沒有ㄕ…表示出任何的支持。所以在追求這個碩士學位的時候，我覺得我是一個人在讀這個學位的。我覺得非常地沮喪與挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You said that this master degree is ugh …a two-year courses program, but you didn’t finish and complete it in the end. Why is that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	因為我無法完成所有的作業。也無法達到一部分要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	Then …ugh for the registration ……of this master degree, what is the last ……semester?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	嗯我最後一個學期，是……2017年的春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If the things you’ve said is true, then ugh …your assignments should have been …ugh, in an …should have been an end in May, 2017. However, after 7 months ugh in December, you and your co-worker’s messages are continuing. Why is that?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	即使我無法完成我的碩士學位，但我仍然想精進我的中文能力。所以雖然我沒有辦法成功地拿到碩士，我…仍然繼續自己研讀中文。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You …ugh, what do you mean is that, even if you can’t …ugh get your master degree, you still wanted to …sharper your Chinese ……and let your Chinese be more fluently. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	沒錯，那就是為什麼我…請我的同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the co, co, colleague, this colleague, ……ugh the role she played was ugh …somehow like your …homeroom teacher?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，她還是我一個真正的好友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Then did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有欸，我有提出我想要給她錢的要…呃，我我有、我有…

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If she declined, then why …ugh did that … she still send messages in the midnight? I think this is somehow ugh …be more to her ……responsibility?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個…我非常好的朋友，也很支持我。她會用她自己的時間來幫助我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still working in that cram school teaching English?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是，我還在那工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	And is this colleague still work with you in the cram school?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	她也還在那工作，但我們現在不是搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have ugh ……any witness you want to subpoena, or any evidence you want to ins …investigate?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	Ugh I hope to subpoena …the co …ugh the defendant’s co-worker to come to the court, which is ugh …the Rong-Er Huang, ugh …works, works in the cram school 美而美 to come here to explain her relationship with the defendant and also explain those messages, what is her goal and her background to send these messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Does the accuser have any further evidence want the court to investigate on your behalf?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I’ve heard that …ugh the cram school have taken some actions toward my husband and his co-worker’s relationship. I think the cram school has convinced Rong-Er Huang to …ugh …resign for his job. So I …I’ve wondered …ugh wondered if the cram school could …ugh …could prove this.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	Does the defendant ugh …want …have any evidence you want the court to investigate on your behalf?Ugh …the current situation is that your master degree …ugh ……may be end in …ugh 2017, May, May, 2017 already. So there is no excuse for you to still sending message with this Rong-Er Huan. And ……ugh even in after …after 9 in the midnight, which is really suspective. So if you have any ……do you have any evidence to …this situation?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我現在想不到任何需要法院為我調查的證據。呃…我已經說了，我和我同事之間的簡訊真的只是為了要精進我的中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court will be set at 4:30 PM on …June 24th, 2018. The procedure is to ask the witness some questions. The pro …ugh the accuser and the defendant must be in the court at that time. And if necessary, you both parties can ugh ……have a lawyer. Is this clear enough?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白了。

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	I’ll inform the defendant’s rights and obligations.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	Firstly, you have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民、或符合相關法令規定者，可申請法律協助。
en-US	Secondly, you have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low-income family, medium-and-low-income family, or you are an aborigine, or meet other qualification set by the law, you might ask the court for legal assistance.

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	Thirdly, you have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you with your case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的。

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment. 

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are her for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The accuser, Yu Han Wang, is filing this case because she suspected her husband, Edward Takayashi, is having an affair with his colleague in the cram school he worked at. The accuser found some intimate messages in the defendant’s phone. And the defendant always found reasons to work late. Moreover, the defendant has been seen go out with his colleague, Ron Er Huang, for multiple times. Therefore, the accuser suspected that the defendant was having an affair.The defendant, your wife is suing you for adultery. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我認為我無罪。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, we will be focusing on investigating the communication between the defendant and his colleague in order to prove that if he’s having an affair. Do both parties understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First I would like to ask the accuser, how long have you been married to your husband? Do you have kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years and we don’t have kids.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Well, do you have your wedding in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	Then, over the past few years, does he keep teaching Portuguese as a job in Taiwan?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he’s a Portuguese teacher. After we were married, he still kept teaching Portuguese.However, Portuguese is not a popular language for Taiwanese to learn. So, his teaching hours were always unstable. There would even be a one or two-month periods between jobs. Therefore, in order to get a more steady income, he decided to teach English.However, English is not his mother tongue. So, he went to seek an advance degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that he decided to seek an advance degree. Do you mean earning a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, the degree he has to acquire is TESOL.He went online and found a distance learning program from California, United States. So, he got to stay at home and did the distance learning instead of going abroad.This way, he can earn enough credits to get a master’s degree so that he can get a job of English teaching in Taiwan with this degree from the States.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Well, what’s the relationship between him and the person he’s having an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues from the cram school. The cram school will arrange a Chinese teacher to partner with an English teacher. That woman is his partner in the cram school.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you find out their affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I only suspected of working late in the cram school too often. I asked him, “It’s just an English cram school, what’s there to stay late for?” He told me that because of partnering, he had to communicate a lot with his partner.At first, I didn’t really suspect him of having an affair. However, when he got back home from work, he would always get some calls. And he would not answer the calls in front of me. He would even go to the study room to answer the phone. So, I checked his phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything unusual in the phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, the same number always appeared. So, I went to check his text messages. After I checked, I found out that he’s been texting with the same person every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Well, it’s just texting. Are the texts juicy?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it’s just regular texting, it’s fine. However, he is a married man. Why would somebody texting some intimate messages. I submitted some of the messages before, so they should be in the investigatory files.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Show exhibit number one. Check the page thirteen. Defendant, are these the text messages in your phone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這些是我手機裡的訊息。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now, I’m going to ask you some questions regarding these messages.The first one was sent at 9:50 PM, December 21st 2017. The number is 0958932123. The text messages said, “我非常想你。” What does it mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	呃嗯…是一個同事發給我的。我記得我那時請假了兩天，所以他可能有點擔心我吧，所以才發了這封訊息。我的同事是在美國接受教育的，所以他的思想非常開放，他說話就是那個樣子，至於為什麼會說「我的愛」，這是因為這是我們稱呼我們在乎的人的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because this colleague is educated in the U.S., her thoughts are pretty westernized. So, “my love” does not mean anything, is that right? 

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	對的，「我的愛」只是用來稱呼那些很好的朋友或是在乎的人，沒什麼特別的。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the phrase before that?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，他只是擔心我而已。我們是工作上的共事夥伴，因此我請了兩天假，他自然而然會想念我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	What your saying is that just because you took two days off, she missed you without your help at work, she texted you “I miss you.” Is that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	對的，訊息就只是這樣而已，並沒有什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Okay, let’s move on to the next message. Text message number 2 was sent at 11:55 PM, December 29th 2017. It was sent by the same person. The message says “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” So, what does this message mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他之所以傳給我這封簡訊是為了教我如何用中文表達。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You’re saying that the reason that this person texted you this message is to help you with your homework. What does that even mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我老婆剛剛有提到的，我正在就讀一個碩士學程。我必須要拿到三十學分，所以自然而然的有一些功課跟練習需要操作。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you please first explain what you’re studying in your master’s degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學程主要為英語教學。在這學程裡當然要學英語教學能力，還有一些文化溝通課程和語文能力的學程。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	You’re trying to earn a master’s degree in TESOL. But there are some cultural communication courses in it, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三個課程是跟文化溝通有官。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So, what are the assignments for this so-called cultural communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這些文化溝通的課程對於每個學生來說都不太一樣。以我來說的話，因為我想在台灣找一個教職工作，所以我必須展現我的教學能力及中文上的溝通能力進以達成我的目標。所以，我很多的作業是中英文章的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Because you have to prove that you have the competence to teach in Taiwan, you have to learn Chinese. And a lot of the assignments are about translation. Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，而當然我也被要求須要加強我的口說、寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s get back to the text message. You said that’s your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對的，我還記得那條訊息。你也知道的，有些中文字，對於外國人來說，是很難理解的，所以當我接到這個作業後，我就傳訊息給我那位同事，要他傳答案給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You typed in Chinese and ask your colleague to type in English and text back to you. This text message is just a product of an assignment, right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	是的，那封簡訊只是我作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Okay. Let’s show the investigatory records again. From page 14 to page 16, look at all the text messages. Are these all your assignments?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對的，這些訊息的目的都只是為了完成我的作業而已。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What’s your explanation on your wife accusing you of having an affair with your colleague?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	在這件事上，我覺得我太太只是想太多了。我知道我可能無法滿足他對於這個家庭的期望，但在我開始這學位的時候，我太太並沒有展現他的任何支持。他一點都不願意幫助我來完成我的學程，如果他一開始多支持我一點的話，我也根本就不用去問我的搭檔了。所以我覺得，對於這整場誤會，他最該怪的是他自己。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	Based on your testimonies, there’s something unhappy going on between you and your wife, right?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們婚姻剛開始的時候的確是蠻快樂的。但後來主要的問題就是我的工作，因為在台灣，教葡萄牙語實在無法獲得穩定的薪水跟工作時間。所以我們就越來越疏遠了，我沒辦法讓他明白我的挫折感，我也不知道要怎麼與他溝通。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay. Let’s get back to your master degree. When does your master degree start? Does it end? Did you get your degree?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2015年的秋天開始這個課程的，這是一個兩年的課程，所以我理應該可以在2017年的五月拿到這個學位。但是，我後來並沒有完成，因為我還有兼職的工作，所以我沒有時間做完所有的作業。就像我說的，我太太從一開始就不支持我。所以，我就像是獨自一人在進攻這個學位，到了後來我已經太累，也充滿了挫折感。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	This course is a two-year course, but you did not finish. Why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成所有的課程作業。也無法完成一些課程的需求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	When is the last semester of your registration?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我註冊在學的最後一個學期是2017年的春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you said, your registration should end on May 2017. So, why are you still texting your colleague long after seven months of the end of your registration? There should be no assignments left, right?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	呃，就算我沒有通過這個學程，我還是想要繼續學中文呀。所以我還是繼續自己跟同事傳簡訊來學習、增強我的中文能力。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	What you’re is that even though you did not finish the master’s degree program, you still want to keep on learning Chinese in order to be more fluent on Chinese, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	沒錯，所以我才尋求我同事的幫助。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	The role your colleague is serving is kind of like your tutor, is that right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不只像是我的家教，也是一個真正的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	並沒有，我曾有提過要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why would she, in the middle of the night, way past sleeping hours, still text to help you? Isn’t this relationship beyond co-worker’s relationships?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	所以我才說，他是一個很支持我的朋友。他犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學中文！

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still working in that cram school to teach English?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	對的，我仍在那裏工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does this colleague still work at that cram school?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	對的，他也仍在這間補習班工作，但我們不再是搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have anyone that you need to summon further to examine? 

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to summon this colleague from Mei Err Mei Cram School, Ron Err Huang, so that she can state this case as a witness and explain those text messages and the background reasons of sending those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, do you need this court to summon anyone to investigate further on?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school did take some actions on the relationships between those two. And they even asked that woman to quit this job. So I was wondering that if we can confirm this matter from the cram school.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any other further evidences that you want this court to investigate for you?The situation now is that your master degree program already ended on May 2017. You really don’t have the rightful reasons to send these messages and you cannot use assignments as an excuse to justify your relationship with your colleague. It really is suspicious. Do you have any evidences that can help you with this case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我並沒有任何需要庭上幫我調查的證據。就像我之前說的，我跟我同事的關係非常簡單，我只是想增強我的中文能力而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next procedure of this case is set at 4:30 PM, on June 24th 2018. We will move on the cross-examination process. Both parties have the right to a lawyer. Do both parties understand? And the accuser and the defendant have to be here.

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也瞭解了。

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today, we are here for adultery case, preparation procedure. The defendant is accused by the accuser, Wang Yu-Han, of adultery case. The defandant has an adultery with her collegue, Huang Ron-Er with her college Ron-Er Huang. As the intimate messages collected by the defendant collected by the accuser, the messages is far beyond coworkers’ relationship constitute . The defendant, the accuser the defendant, you are accused of adultery. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s prosedure, the court will going the court is going to ask the defendant about the the the relationship between him and his coworker to clarify if the adultery is true. Do both parties understand today’s procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	了解。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	The accuser, how long have you married with your husband? Do you have an do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years and we do not have children.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Are you married in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met each other four years ago. At that time, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the past years, is his job to teach Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When I just married when we just married, he was a Portuguese teacher  and he kept teaching Portguese after we married. However, the however Portuguese is not a dominant language in Taiwan, so my husband teaching hour is not certainty. Thus, it’s always period between jobs. So, in order to make a fixed salary, he wants to teach English, but English is not his major language, so he wants to seek an advanced agree. 

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mention seek an avanced agree. Does it means that getting a degree in Taiwan.

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Because he wanted to teach English,  so the degree he got need to be related to English teaching. He found a distance learnig program provided by California in USA so that he can complete the course the requirements through online learning. After he complete the course required, he will got he will get a bachelor degree he will get a US bachelor degree which can help him teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So, what is the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues in a cram school. The cram school provided the course taught by foreign teacher and Taiwanese teacher. So, the woman is the Chinese teacher. 

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know that they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At the beginning, I just think that that why did he always work overtime in the cram school. He said because of the because he needs to partner with the Chinese teacher, so he will need to have some communication with his partner, but I still think that it’s just a cram school, why do you still need to work overtime? At the beginning, I don’t doubt him. But, afterwards, he always getting his phone calls in the study room. In other words, he tried to avoid making me see her him talking with others, so I checked the phone books so I checked his phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So, what do you found in his cellphone? 

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	After check his phone books, I find there is a phone number which he always called. Furthermore, I went to check his text message and I found he always has text messages with a woman.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Text message seems to be a not seriors problem. Is the content of the text message not appropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	But it is not ordinary messages. My husband is a married man. Why did allow a woman to send him some intimate messages. I have provided those messages to the court. I think they are now in the files.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Exibit 1 in page thirty one in page thirteen. The defendant, please check if these messages is from your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這就是我手機上的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now, I need to now I want to ask you some questions about the message. First, that text message is sent at twenty first fifty, on twenty first in December in 2017. The phone number is 2958 0958932123. The content of the message is that I miss you so much. What’s that means what does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那封簡訊是來自於我的同事。那一次我請了兩天假，所以她覺得非常擔心，才寄了這樣的一封簡訊給我。我這位同事是在美國受教育的，所以她的所以她表達方式比較開放，這就是他們表達愛的一種方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that your colleague is educated in US, so her so her expression is more open. The expression my love is not special, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	對，這不是一個太奇怪的方式。這就是朋友之間的表達方式。這就是好朋友之間或非常在乎對方的人之間的表達方式。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	So, what about the the last sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，我同事只是很擔心我，因為我請假了兩天。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that the text message so do you mean that the message texted by her is just because that you leave away for two days and she missed you for accompanying you to teaching?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的，這就是我想表達的。我認為那封簡訊真的不是個大問題。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Exibit 2, the text message is sent at twenty third fifty five, on twenty ninth in December in 2017. The phone number is the same as the above. The content is that I want to by my side I want to by your side, and what can we truly be together?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這封簡訊是想問我這些英文句子在中文裡面應該怎麼表達。 這只是個工作。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You are mean that so do you mean that she roll this message to help you compete your assignment? What does that means?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太說的，我正在爭取一個碩士學位而且我必須要完成30學分。所以很正常所以很正常地，我必須會有一些工作我必須會有一些作業要做。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Uh so please explain that what do you actually study to achieve your master degree.

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程是英語教學，這裡面一部分包含了英語教學， 另一部分包含語言能力及文化。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that you will get a degree of TESOL, but the course also includes some culture communication?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，如果沒記錯的話，有三門課是跟文化溝通有關係的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what does the assignment which is related to this kind of course? 

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這樣的文化或是溝通的課程是將會因人而異。拿我自己當例子好了，我想要得到英語教學的學位，所以我必須要證明自己對於中文有一定的了解。所以我的作業當中有很多是關於中英對譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you wanted to getting a teaching position in Taiwan, so the course require you to have the understanding of Chinese, so many assignments related to your course is translation between Chinese and English. Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的沒錯。此外我還被要求要精進我的口說跟寫作寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So, let’s get back to the point. The message we just mentioned is your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，當我收到作業上的那兩那幾句中文時，我不知道要如何翻譯他們，法官也知道的，中文字有的時候對於外國人來說難以辨識，所所以我就向我的同事求助並請她將答案寄給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So, the situation is that you ask the your colleague the translation of the Chinese sentence and ask her to send the answer to you through text message, so the message is just a part of your assignment.

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	是的，那封簡訊就只是我作業的一部分而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	The defendant, please see the evidence show on Page No.14 to page 16. These message are all for your assignments, right?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些所有這所有的簡訊都是為了完成作業而存在的。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So, regard so concerning that your wife think that you have an affair with your colleague, what’s your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	關於這件事，我覺得我的太太真的想得太多了。我知道她對於我沒有對這個家提供我知道她一直在意我沒有對這個家提供資助，但我想讓法官知道的是，從我開始這段課程，我的太太也沒有提供我任何支持。因為在我想要取得學位這件事上，我太太的我太太的態度一直不是那麼的支持，如果她可以表示出支持的話，我就不需要去找我的同事尋求協助了阿!所以我覺得她應該為這整件誤解負一些責任。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	So, it seems that you are not satisfied with your relationships?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們的婚姻一開始，我們也曾經過得很幸福。但是一切的問題都來自於我的工作，我無法在教授葡萄牙語上得到穩定的授課時數。這件事，關於我的工作這件事，是造成我們不愉快的最大原因，而我們也已經因為這件事起了很多衝突，我的太太不相信我已經在工作這件事上做了最大的努力，我不知道如何讓他了解我的挫折和我面對的處境。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Uh, back to your master degree, when did the course begin and do you complete your course and get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2015年4月開始的這個課程，這個課程需要兩年的時間完成，理論上我應該在2017年5月得到取得碩士學位，但因為我一直有做一些兼職，所以沒有足夠的時間念書，最後也就沒有得到這個學位。正如我所說，在我追求學位的這件事上，我的太太並沒有展現出她的支持，我覺得我是一個人孤軍奮戰在取得在追求這個學位，這讓我覺得很沮喪。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So, you say that the whole program last for two years and you don’t complete the course and get the degree, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成所有的作業一些還有一些課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	What is the end of your registered period?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一學期是在2017年的春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you mentioned above, your course may your course is supposed to was supposed to end in May in 2017, so you are supposed to not have the assignment at all, but you still have text message with your colleague after seven month of your expiration.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	雖然我最後沒有取得學位，但這不代表我就放棄精進我的中文了，所以在課程結束後，我仍持續地靠自學進修我的中文。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even though you didn’t complete your degree, you still want to keep improving your Chinese competence. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，這就是為什麼我持續尋求我同事的協助。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So, the role of your colleague is like a personal teacher?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	對我而言，她不只是個家教，而是我真正的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	So, do you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有耶，不過我曾經有說過要付她報酬，但她婉拒了我。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	So, if you didn’t pay her, why does your colleague sending you answer in the midnight, which is a sleeping time of her? I think the situation is beyond the coworker’s relationship.

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說她是我真正的好朋友啊!在我學習中文這件事情，她一直表示著為最大的支持。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的，我還在那裡工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So that colleague so is that colleague still work there still working there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是的，她也還在那裡工作，但我們不再是彼此的搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any person that you want to subpoena or any evidence that need the court to investigate?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena the defendant’s colleague Huang Ron-Er to serve as a witness. I hope that she can explain her relation with the defendant.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence that need the court to investigate for you

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I hope that the court can subpoena the cram school 美而美. Uh, I hope that the court will inquire the cram school 美而美 about the whole situation. I heard that the cram school once took some actions to deal with this situation and they even wanted to persuade the woman to leave.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence that need the court to help you with your case? The current situation is that your master degree course ended in May in 2017, so that’s not an explanation that can help you clarify your relationship between you and Huang Ron-Er. So, do you have any evidence you want the court to investigate?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我實在是沒有任何證據可以代表我，就像我說的，我們之間的關係很簡單，就只是我想要持續進修英文，而我的同事提供我協助，就這樣而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So the procedure of inquiry of the witness is set to be at four thirty PM on twenty forth in June in 2018. Both of the parties need to attend the procedure attend the court. Both of you can hire a lawyer.

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白。

en-US	Now I’m going to read the right of the defendant

en-US	You have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民、或符合相關法令規定者，可申請法律協助。

en-US	Do you fully understand your right?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	了解

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	The prosecutor please states the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	We’ re here today for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The accuser filed the case because her husband had an affair with his coworker, and it’s beyond co-workers’ relationship. The accuser found some intimate messages in her husband phone. Her husband often made up reasons for extra hours working, also he would found up reason for doing tele-conferencing with his co-worker Rong-Er Huang. The defendant, your wife accused you had an adultery case, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我無罪

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s procedure, we will ask the details of text messages of the defendant to confirm if the adultery case existed. Does both parties understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	The accuser, how long have you been married to your husband? Do you have a child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for 4 years, and we don’t have kids. 

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Did you marry in Taiwan, or in other country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband 4 years ago. He first came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	Well, over the past few years, his job in Taiwan is just teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he still teaches Portuguese. However, there aren’t many people in Taiwan want to learn Portuguese so his teaching hours is not stable. Sometimes, there is a period between jobs, even for two months. In order to increase the income he decided to teach English. However, his native language is not English so he decided to seek an advance degree in English.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned he decided to seek an advance degree. Does it mean that he wanted to seek a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wanted to teach English, he wanted to get a degree of TESOL. He found a online platform about distance learning program provided by California, so he doesn’t have to go to America to get that degree. After finish all the classes, he can get a master degree. Then, he can get a English teaching job in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what’s the relationship between him and the person he has adultery?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	There are coworkers in the cram school. In that cram school, they have foreign teachers and Chinese teachers. They partner up to teach the classes, so the lady is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At the beginning, I found that he often worked over hours at the cram school. I asked him why he had to spend so much time at the cram school. It’s not necessary. He said that because he had to partner up with Taiwanese teacher. He had to communicate with her. At first, I didn’t doubt that he has an affair. However, sometimes after he came home, he often had a phone call. He didn’t answer the phone in front of me. Instead, he went to the study room to answer the phone. After I checked his phone, I found that there are some messages.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything unusual in his phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	First, I found that there is always a same number in his phone record. Then, I checked his messages. I found that he kept texting with the same lady, and they have messages everyday.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even if they are messaging, that’s not a big deal. Is the context inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it just a normal message, why did she kept texting to the man who is married. I found some intimate messages. It should be in the file that I provided to the court before.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	As you can see in the file, there are some messages in the file. I want to ask the defendant. Is that the messages in your cellphone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的這是我手機裡的訊息

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Then, I want to ask some questions about these messages.The first message is sent from the phone number 0958932123, at 9:50 pm, on Dec 21st, 2017. The message is : “ I really miss you, my love.” What does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那封簡訊是我同事傳的，那時我請假兩天，所以她只是傳簡訊來關心我一下。我的同事是在美國受教育的。他的思想非常開放，至於my love 這個字只是用來表達我們在乎的人而已。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So the person is educated in the U.S. Her mind is westernized, and she openly expresses her emotion, so the word “my love” is not a big deal. Is that right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	是的，那個只是我們彼此之間稱呼在乎的朋友的方式

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the former part of the message?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	正如我所說的，他只是很擔心我而已，在我請假兩天時，他非常的擔心，畢竟我們是工作上的搭擋。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So did you mean that because you were away for two days, and without your assistance, she just missed you, so she sent the message to worry about you?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的，那封簡訊真的沒有什麼

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Then, the second message also sent from the same number, at 11:55 pm, Dec 29th, 2017. The content is “ I want you by my side, when can we be truly together? What does it mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他寫那個句子是為了幫助我寫中文作業

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You meant that the purpose that the message to help you to do the homework. What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	正如我太太先前提過的，我為了要拿到我的學位，我必須完成30學分的課程，還有一些作業及習題。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you please explain what is your master degree about?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程主要是英語教學，那個課程涵蓋英語教學，以及文化和語言能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So you get a degree of TESOL, and there are some culture and communication courses?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的我記得有三門課程是與語言文化有關

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What are the assignments of the course Culture and Communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	在這門課的作業是因人而異的。以我來說，我為了要在台灣取得英語教學工作，我必須要有能力用當地語言溝通。所以我很多作業都是中英翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	In order to get the English teaching degree, you have to finish some assignments about Chinese-English translation. Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，我還需要精進我的口說與寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Then….Let’s go back to the sentence we just said. Is that your assignment

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，那是我的作業，當時我看到這個句子我不知道該怎麼翻譯。你也知道，中文字對外國人來說是很困難的，所以我就問我的同事，並請她傳訊息告訴我答案。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So you meant… because you asked some questions about Chinese, your colleague sent you this message. This is just about the assignment. Is that what you meant?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Please see the evidence 1, page 14-16. These messages are all your assignment. The person sent you the messages because you need help for your assignments. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What’s your explanation about your wife accused you had an affair with your coworker?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太對這件事情真的是想太多了，我知道她很不滿我沒有那麼多能力去支撐整個家庭，但當時我要去進修的時候她完全沒任何支持。因為他一開始就沒有支持我。如果她當時支持我的話，我就不會去找我同事幫忙，她應該怪罪於自己。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your words, it seems that you didn’t get along with your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們剛結婚時，的確相處得非常愉快。主要是我工作的問題，因為教授葡萄牙文的時數並不是很固定。所以這就變成我們之間很大的問題，我們常常為這件事吵架，她並不相信我已經盡力，她並不知道我因這件事非常挫折。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	So let’s go back to your master degree. When did you start it? Does it finish? Did you get your degree?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2015年秋季註冊的，那是兩年的課程，我應該會在2017年的五月完成，但我一直有兼職工作，我沒有時間做作業，所以我沒有完成它。就像我所說的，我的太太並沒有支持我，讓我覺得很孤獨、很累，所以我就沒有拿到學位。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You meant that this program is for two years, and you didn’t finish in the end. Why is that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成所有課程的作業。以及一些課程的要求

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	When is the last semester you registered?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我最後註冊的學期是2017年的春學期。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you mentioned, your program should be finished on 2017 in May. But the messages happened 7 months after the program finished. Why was that?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	就算我完成我的學位，這並不代表我不想精進我的語言能力。所以就算我沒有完成我得學位我還是有在自學，精進我的語言能力。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You meant that even you didn’t finish your program. You still want to learn Chinese to improve your Chinese ability. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫忙

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleague is just like your tutor. Is that right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不只是我的家教，還是我的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	不，我曾提出要付她錢，但她拒絕。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why would she help you in the midnight? Is that beyond what the coworker has to do?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這就是為什麼我會說他是非常支持我的朋友，她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still work in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的我還在那工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does this colleague still work there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是的，她還在那工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any evidence that you want to investigate? Do you want to subpoena someone?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, Ron Er Huang. I want her to come to the court to explain the relationship between her and the defendant and explain the content of the messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that MeiErMei cram school had tried to deal with their relationship. They even asked their colleague Ron Er Huang to quit the job. I would like to subpoena the officer of the cram school to the court.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? According to your words, your program should be finished on May 2017. You have no excuse for that, especially the messages were often sent after 9 pm. Do you have any evidence that you can prove that is just for the assignment?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我目前有任何想要法院幫忙調查的證據。就像我所說的，我與同事之間的關係非常簡單，我只是想要提升我的中文能力而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court date will be set on 2018, June 24th, at 4:30 pm. The court will ask some questions to the witnesses. The both parties please make sure to come to the court. If necessary, you can hire a lawyer. Does the both parties understand ?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	Today we here for an adultery case, case number 2345 for the preparatory procedure.

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	Now we’re going to inform the rights and obligations of the defendant.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	You have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民、或符合相關法令規定者，可申請法律協助。
en-US	You have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low-income family, a medium-and-low-income family, or if you are an aborigine or meet other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Does the defendant fully understand his rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of an adultery case. The accuser Wang Yuhan, she thinks her husband is having an intimate relationship with his co-worker in the company. The accuser found intimate messages in the phone of his husband and his husband always found excuses for working late in the night. And he always has tele-conferencing with his coworker in the night. This situation, she thinks, has beyond coworker’s relationship, therefore she decided to file an adultery case. Defendant, your wife thinks you’ve committed the case of adultery, what’s your plea? 

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然沒有罪。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, this court will ask the details of the relationship of the defendant and the coworker to decide whether they have committed adultery. Do you fully understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We’ve been married for four years, and we do not have kids.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	So do you get married with your husband in Taiwan or in any other countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in past years, is your husband’s main job about teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, he continued as a Portuguese teacher. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so my husband always had an unstable condition in teaching Portuguese, for example, he would have few weeks not teaching Portuguese. Therefore, to make his income stable, however, English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced education.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that your husband decided to seek an advanced program in Taiwan, do you mean he wants a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wants to take English-teaching as his job, therefore he must have a TESOL certificate. He found online a distance learning program in California, therefore he didn’t have to go to the US. And he can sit at home and receive distance learning and meet the requirements of the program. After he finished all the credits, he would have a postgraduate degree. Therefore, with such a certificate, he can have a job as an English teacher.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So What’s the relationship between he and the partner he is having a relationship with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	The person he is having a relationship with is a co-worker in his class. The teaching school has one Chinese teacher and one foreign teacher for one class. And the woman is the Chinese teacher in his class.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know they are having an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, he always worked overtime and didn’t come home. I’m confused that it’s only a teaching school. There’s no reason for him to work overtime. He explains that he had to work with a Chinese teacher, and there’s much to communicate with that Chinese teacher. At first, he didn’t think he is having an affair. But later on, I found he constantly received telephone calls at home. And he didn’t receive those phone calls in front of me. Instead, he goes to the study room to receive those phone calls. So I got a little curious about the intention of him and later I checked his cellphone and found the reason.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, I found one telephone number constantly showing in his phone book. And therefore, I checked his messages and found that he sent text messages to that number constantly.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	I think it’s ok to send text messages. Is it because the content of the text messages is inappropriate? 

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	They are not sending common text massages. Considering he is a married person, it’s not appropriate to send intimate messages to another woman. I have report to the court the content of the messages. I think they are in the files. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Exhibit evidence, page 13. Please be noted of the content of the messages. Defendant, please take a look, do you send those messages?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的， 這些是我手機上的訊息。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Therefore, I will ask you a few questions about the text messages. The first message is sent by the phone number 0958-932123 at 9:50 pm, on December 21st, 2017. The content is I really miss you, my love, so what’s your explanation?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	該簡訊的內容由同事傳給我，當時我記得我休假了兩天，她非常擔心，因此發送了這樣的簡訊。我的同事在美國受教育，思想開放，這也是她之所以這樣談話，這樣表達的原因，至於“My love”的部分，這是我們對關心的人的稱呼。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the sender received her education in the US, and got very westernized and she is very open-minded about stuffs like emotions, and the phrase my love sent by her does not have any special connotations? 

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	是的，這樣的話是在朋友間，或是在互相關心的人之間的用法。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	So how about the phrase before my love?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	正如我之前所述，她非常擔心我，作為我的同事對於我離開兩天非常擔心。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So do you mean because you take two days off from work, she got very worried about you and sent you messages like she missed you.

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的，這就是當時的背景情況，那封簡訊沒有什麼大的問題。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message is sent by the same person at 11:55pm on December 29th, 2017. the content is I really want you be my side, when can we be truly together? So what does this text message mean and what does it exist?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她當時寫這封簡訊是告訴我怎麼樣表達我作業中的用法。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you mean that the sender sent you this message to help you with this message, what does it mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	正如我妻子所向法庭所述，我當時正在修讀一個碩士課程，需要完成30分的學分，因此也需要完成一些作業和考試。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Please explain what on earth your master program is about?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士課程是英語教學，內容包括英文教學，文化以及語言能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that there’s something about culture in your English-teaching master program.

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三門課關於文化與溝通議題。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What’s the homework of these culture and communications courses.

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這樣的一門作業每個人都有所不同，就以我為例，因為我在台灣，希望獲得一個英語教學相關的崗位，要達到這樣的目標，我需要提高自己的英語能力，所以要學好中文。因此我的作業很多方面很多都是中英句子的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So you mean you want to seek an English teaching position in Taiwan, and in this master program you have to prove yourself the Chinese competency. The coursework includes assignments of translating Chinese and English sentences, am I right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，我同樣被要求提升自己的讀寫能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Ok, let’s go back to that text massage. Is that your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，因為我當時寫的作業有一些不太理解，因為中文中有些東西外國人很難認， 因此我就請我的同事幫助我來翻譯，然後將答案傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So you sent the Chinese text message to her and she sent back the Chinese answers to you. Is that your homework?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	OK, defendant please look at the file One, page 14 to 16. Please carefully check the content of the messages. Are those messages all the assignments of you? Is it because it’s your homework and you sent them to her to help you with your assignment?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊都是同樣的目的，針對我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So what’s your explanation in response to your wife’s suit that you have an affair with the third person?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我的妻子把這件事想得太嚴重了，我知道我持家的能力並不是很好，但她沒在剛開始的時候幫助我啊。因為她一直都沒有幫助我完成我的學位，如果不是這樣，我也不會讓同事幫忙，她應該為此負責，這是誤解的原因。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, it seems that you have some unhappy situations with your wife. 

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	剛開始相處時，我們彼此都度過了愉快的時光， 但問題就在於我的工作，我剛開始在這裡教葡萄牙語，但並不能獲得穩定的 教學時間。之後工作問題就成了我們之間的問題，我們時而為此吵架，她並不理解我的努力也並不知道我的沮喪和當時的困境。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Ok, let’s go back to the master program, when does this master program start? Does it end? Did you get your diploma?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	這個項目開始於2015年的秋季，應當耗時2年時間，並在2017年5月結束，但是我當時在兼職，我沒有足夠的時間做作業，所以並沒有完成學位。正如我所言，我的妻子在我這個碩士項目上並沒有很幫助我，我覺得我彷彿一個人在追求這個學位，因此非常累也非常沮喪。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean this is a two-year program, and you failed to finish it, what’s the reason?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有的課程作業。也沒辦法完成課堂的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So when is the end of the last semester registration?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	最後註冊的學期是2017年春季。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you said, the last semester is May 2017, therefore you shouldn’t have assignment from then on. But the text messages last 7 months after the completion of your master program, what’s your explanation?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	好吧，儘管我沒有完成自己的碩士項目，但這並不意味著我不能繼續學習中文， 所以結束後，我也是想繼續提升自己的中文能力，所以我繼續一個人努力。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that although you didn’t complete your master program, you still want to sharpen you Chinese competency, am I right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，這也是我讓我同事幫助我的原因。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the role played by your co-worker is like a home teacher, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	對我來說，她不僅像個家教，更像是個很好的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay the tuition to her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我之前說要給她學費，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, is it beyond coworker’s relationship that she sent text messages to you to answer your questions at midnight?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	正如我之前所說，她真的在幫助我，利用她的閒餘時間幫我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach at that teaching school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的，我仍在那裏工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does your coworker still work there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是的，她也在那裡教學，但我們並沒有組成一個班。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there any evidence you want to investigate or any witness you want to ask to the court?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	This court wants to subpoena the colleague Huang Rong’er, to explain the relationship between these two and the context as well as the purpose of these text massages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Accuser, is there anything you want the court to further investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard the teaching school has done something about their relationship. They even talked to the coworker to resign. I want to know if it’s right and I want to further investigate this evidence.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there any evidence you want us to help investigate for you? Considering your master program has already finished on May 2017, you have no reason to keep sending text messages to your coworker Huang Rong’er for assignment. And the conversations start usually at 9 pm. This is really suspicious. Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我沒有任何的證據作為進一步的調查，我和同事之間的短信互動實際上非常簡單，就是我想提升我的語言能力，精進我的中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next proceeding starts at 4:30 pm on June 24th, 2018. Both the accuser and the defendant shall be present. If required, both parties can have a lawyer, do you understand?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我了解。

en-US	Today, we are here for preparatory procedure. We will see the evidence provided. Both the prosecutor and the defendant can ask questions. The defendant did not hire a lawyer, so he will state by himself. The defendant, do you understand the procedure?

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也了解

zh-TW	請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
en-US	The prosecutor, please check and confirm the evidence used in this case and ask questions.

zh-TW	被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
en-US	The defendant, at 7:50 p.m. on June 18th 2020 at the door of your house, you had a quarrel with neighborhood, who is also the accuser, and your quarrel came into physical confrontation. In the investigatory record on page 8, there are statements made at the police station. In the statements you made at police station, you said that you went home at 6:30 p.m. at that day. Then you put your motorcycle in the parking slot, and then you went up to the stairs. After you have dinner, you looked down stairs quickly, and you found out there was someone moving your motorcycle. So you go down stairs to check the situation immediately. When you go down the stairs, you found that the one who moved your motorcycle is Damin Chang, the accuser… umm who moved your motorcycle. Then you asked why he move your motorcycle. The accuser said that because your motorcycle stock his way, and you should not stop motorcycle at that place, so he moved your motorcycle. Because you disagree with his statement, so you two have quarrel, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
zh-TW	是的，事情大概就是這樣發生的。我想要強調的是，這不是我們第一次為了停車格的事情而吵架。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
en-US	You mean that both parties have many quarrels about the parking slot, right?

en-US	I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
zh-TW	我住在那個社區已經超過8個月了，這幾個月來，告訴人移我的摩托車，而且沒有經過我的同意。他只是不喜歡我把機車放在那個位子，但是他沒有任何理由可以這麼做。在這個社區，每個人都可以把機車停在有空位的地方。

zh-TW	以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
en-US	Then, have you ever reported this kind of case in police station?

en-US	When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences. 
zh-TW	之前，我都想說要避免衝突，所以有的時候我就會不太在意，或者是假裝沒有看到這類的情形。針對剛剛的問題，我的回答是沒有，我沒有為這件事情報過案，但是其他的鄰居有遇到跟我類似的問題。

zh-TW	在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
en-US	Are there specific parking slots in your neighborhood?

en-US	No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
zh-TW	null

zh-TW	所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
en-US	So, in your neighborhood, anyone can stop their motorcycle when there is an empty place?

en-US	Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
zh-TW	是的，只要有空位的話，任何人都可以停在那個空位裡。

zh-TW	那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
en-US	Then, are there any parking slot in the empty area?

en-US	Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
zh-TW	是的，市政府有畫至少十格以上的停車格在那個空地。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
en-US	In the investigatory record one on page 24, the picture showed that there are parking slots in the defendant’s neighborhood. The defendant, please check the picture. 

en-US	 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
zh-TW	是的，照片裡的就是我們社區的機車停車格。

zh-TW	那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
en-US	Then, at that day, why did your quarrels become the physical confrontation?

en-US	When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
zh-TW	當我看到有人在移我的摩托車的時候，我立刻從樓上衝到樓下去看發生甚麼事。就像我說的，我不是第一次遇到那樣的情形，所以在那個晚上，我就再也忍不住我的憤怒。當我下樓看的時候，我看到，告訴人已經把他的手放到我的摩托車上，我問他，為甚麼要移我的摩托車，他沒有回答，所以，我就更往前一步站，來阻止他行動。

zh-TW	所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you try to stop the accuser so it became in to the physical confrontation?

en-US	Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
zh-TW	對，當我推他放在機車把手上的手，他就是不放開。

zh-TW	你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
en-US	Did you remember who start the physical confrontation first

en-US	I believe I tried to push his hands away.
zh-TW	我記得是我把他的手從我的機車上拿開。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
en-US	I’ll show the investigatory record one on page 8, the statement made at the police station. In investigatory record on page 9, line 10, the record showed that you tried to move the accuser’s hand on the motorcycle with much force because he grab your motorcycle tightly. You said that you moved first, so is that the move you said before?

en-US	Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
zh-TW	是的，剛那個就是我在警局裡描述的行動。

zh-TW	在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
en-US	When you move the accuser’s hand, what is his reaction?

en-US	He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
zh-TW	他沒有把手從我機車上移開，更糟糕的是，他把我的機車抓得更緊。

zh-TW	所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
en-US	So the other party did not move his hand from your motorcycle. Instead, he grab your motorcycle more tightly, right?

en-US	Yes.
zh-TW	是的

zh-TW	接下來發生什麼事呢？
en-US	Then, what happened next?

en-US	Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
zh-TW	因為他不把手從我的機車上放開，所以我就推了他的肩膀，希望他可以把手放開。

zh-TW	因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
en-US	So that’s why you push his shoulder?

en-US	Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
zh-TW	是的，我有推他肩膀。

zh-TW	你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
en-US	Did you think that you push him with a strong force?

en-US	No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
zh-TW	沒有，我只是輕輕推他一下，就像是我們平常要提醒別人要做哪些事，或阻止別人做某件事的時候會有的那種輕輕推一下。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
en-US	Then, we will show the investigatory record one on page 48. On this page, the medical record in the lein heh hospital. In the medical record, there are many scratches and bruises on accuser’s body and the back of his hand. Why did these injuries happened? Is that the push you did cause?

en-US	I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
zh-TW	我不曉得那些傷口和瘀青是怎麼來的，我並沒有造成他的這些傷口。

zh-TW	有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
en-US	Is there anyone can prove your statement? Is there any witness saw the situation at that day?

en-US	My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor. 
zh-TW	我的女朋友那時候也在家，她知道我那時候去處理那件事，她也有看到我們的事發經過。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
en-US	You mean that your girlfriend saw the procedure of your confrontation?

en-US	She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
zh-TW	我的女友在我們爭執到一半的時候下樓，她有拿手機，試著錄下當時的過程，以防我們之後需要那段影片。

zh-TW	準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
en-US	When did your girlfriend exactly came to saw your quarrels and try to record the clip?

en-US	She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
zh-TW	她在我第一次嘗試想要抓我的機車的時候下來的。

zh-TW	後來她有拍成功嗎？
en-US	Then, did she record the clip successfully?

en-US	No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
zh-TW	沒有，就在我女朋友拿出手機錄的時候，告訴人警告他不可以錄，但是他並沒有權利告訴我的女朋友這麼做。

zh-TW	那我的問題先問到這裡。
en-US	Then, I have no further questions.

zh-TW	今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
en-US	The defendant, today is the preliminary preparatory procedure. Do you need the court to investigate any evidence on your behalf in the next court?

en-US	Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day. 
zh-TW	是的，我想要求法院調查那天兩個監視器裡面的影片。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
en-US	You mean that there are two CCTV in your streets, and you want us to check the CCTV clips there? If so, can provide the exactly time or section that you want us to check specifically?

en-US	I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
zh-TW	我是在七點四十分下樓的，因此，我希望法院可以檢查七點三十到八點十分的影片。

zh-TW	檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any questions about the defendant’s request?

zh-TW	沒有意見。
en-US	No.

zh-TW	今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？
en-US	Today’s court is dismissed. The next court is set to be at 2:30 p.m. at August 8th 2020. In the next court, we will examine the CCTV clips and asked the opinions of the defendant and accuser. The defendant and the prosecutor, do you have any further questions?

zh-TW	沒有。
en-US	No, I rest.

en-US	No. 
zh-TW	我沒有，謝謝。

zh-TW	那今天開庭到此結束，請在簽完筆錄後離席，謝謝。
en-US	Then, today’s court is dismissed. The defendant, please sign the court record before you leave.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也了解。

zh-TW	請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
en-US	Prosecutor, please show the evidence and ask the defendant some questions. 

zh-TW	被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
en-US	Defendant, you had argument with your neighbor and evolved into physical confrontation because he moved your motorbike. The incident happened in front of your house at 7:50 p.m. on June 18, 2020. I’ll show you the statement made at the police station on P.8 in investigation record one. In the statement, you went back home at 6:30 p.m., parked your motorbike, and then went upstairs. After dinner, you looked down and saw someone move your motorbike so you went downstairs to check. When you went downstairs, you found your neighbor also the accuser 張大明was moving your motorbike. You asked him why he moved your motorbike. Then, he replied because your motorbike blocked his car and you couldn’t park here so he moved it. You disagreed with his statement so you had argument with him, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
zh-TW	是的，事情就是這樣發生的。我只想強調這已經不是第一次為了這樣的是，而發生爭執了。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
en-US	You mean, it’s not the first time you argue about parking the motorbike?

en-US	I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
zh-TW	我已經住在這裡至少八個月了。而告訴人已經不是第一次無故移動了我的摩托車。他只是看不慣我把車停在那裡…。這社區裡的每個人都可以停車在這裡，如果這裡有空位的話。

zh-TW	以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
en-US	Have you ever reported to the police …like this before?

en-US	When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences. 
zh-TW	之前發生口角時，我會想要避免衝突。有時候，我不會在意他移動我的車子。有時候，我會假裝沒看到。回答剛才的問題，我沒有去警局報案過，但其他鄰居也發生過類似的事。

zh-TW	在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
en-US	In your neighborhood, do you all park your motorbikes in fixed spaces?

en-US	No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
zh-TW	沒有，我們可以停在任何的空位。也就是，先到的人先停。

zh-TW	所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
en-US	So, everyone can park his motorbike of there is empty space, right?

en-US	Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
zh-TW	沒錯，只要有空位，大家都能停車在那裡。

zh-TW	那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
en-US	Are there any parking slots drawn in the empty space?

en-US	Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
zh-TW	沒錯，市政府有畫超過10格停車格。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
en-US	I’ll show you the photo on P.24 in investigation record one. In the photo, there are parking slots for motorbikes. Defendant, please make sure. 

en-US	 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
zh-TW	沒錯，照片裡面就是我們社區可以停放機車的停車格。

zh-TW	那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
en-US	How did your argument evolve into physical confrontation?

en-US	When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
zh-TW	當我看到有人移動我的摩托車時，我便衝下樓查看。如我剛才所說，這已經不是第一次有人移動我的車。我那時已經忍無可忍。當我下樓時，我看到告訴人將手放在我摩托車的把手上。我問他在做什麼，但他沒有回我任何一句話。…

zh-TW	所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
en-US	You mean when the accuser moved your motorbike, you want to stop him soyou have confrontation, right?

en-US	Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
zh-TW	是的，當我試著握住我的摩托車把手時，他並沒有放手。

zh-TW	你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
en-US	Do you remember who started first?

en-US	I believe I tried to push his hands away.
zh-TW	我只是想試著把他的手挪開。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
en-US	I’ll show you the statement made at the police station on P.8 in investigatory record. On P.9 line 10, the accuser grabbed the handlebars tightly and moved your motorbike. So, you… pushed his hands away. …

en-US	Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
zh-TW	是的，這就是我在警局陳述衝突發生的過程。

zh-TW	在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
en-US	When you pushed his hands away, what was the accuser’s reaction?

en-US	He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
zh-TW	他沒有鬆手。而且他甚至握得更緊。

zh-TW	所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
en-US	You mean the other party didn’t move his hands and even grabbed the handlebars tightly, right?

en-US	Yes.
zh-TW	沒錯

zh-TW	接下來發生什麼事呢？
en-US	What happened next?

en-US	Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
zh-TW	因為從他的肢體語言來看，他看起來沒有想要鬆手。所以我才推了他的肩膀要他放開把手。

zh-TW	因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
en-US	Because of this, you pushed his shoulder, right?

en-US	Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
zh-TW	是的，我因為這樣推了他的肩膀。

zh-TW	你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
en-US	Do you think you pushed his shoulder with much force?

en-US	No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
zh-TW	沒有，我只是輕輕推了一下，就和其他人會推別人去做或不做一樣。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
en-US	I’ll show you the hospitalization on P.48 in investigatory record one. In the hospitalization, there are multiple injuries and bruises on his arms and bodies.How did he suffer? Is it because you pushed his shoulder?

en-US	I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
zh-TW	我不知道為什麼他身上有多處的瘀青和受傷。這不是我造成的。

zh-TW	有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
en-US	Is there anyone who can verify your statement and the details of the incident?

en-US	My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor. 
zh-TW	那時我女朋友正好在家。他知道我下樓，也知道這樣的事已經不是第一次發了。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
en-US	You mean your girlfriend spotted the incident at that time?

en-US	She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
zh-TW	她在我們爭執到一半時下樓，想要拍下當時案發的照片以作為證據。

zh-TW	準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
en-US	Specifically speaking, when did your girlfriend do downstairs and try to take a photo about the incident?

en-US	She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
zh-TW	就在我第一次握著把手時，她就下來了。

zh-TW	後來她有拍成功嗎？
en-US	Did she take a photo successfully?

en-US	No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
zh-TW	沒有，當我女朋友要拿手機出來時，告訴人就警告他，但他沒有權力制止她拍照。

zh-TW	那我的問題先問到這裡。
en-US	I have no further questions.

zh-TW	今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
en-US	Today is the preliminary preparatory procedure. Before the next court, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate?

en-US	Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day. 
zh-TW	有，我想要法院調閱在場兩個監視器畫面。

zh-TW	是的，我了解。

zh-TW	請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	As stated in the indictment.

zh-TW	被告Steven Knox於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在其自家門口 （地址為：新北市板橋區長江路 23號6樓），因其摩托車被挪動而與鄰居（即告訴人）發生口角，進而產生肢體衝突。經告訴人至醫院驗傷，醫師診斷為手臂、身體多處挫傷、瘀青，後被提告。檢察官起訴被告違反刑法375條之傷害罪，被告做何答辯？
en-US	The incident happened at 7:50 p.m. on June 18, 2020. It happened in front of the accused’s house which is located at floor 6, number 23, Changjiang Road, Banqiao District, New Taipei City.… The motorcycle of the accused has been moved. Therefore, the accuser and accused have some argument, which caused their physical confrontation. Later, the accuser went to hospital to see his condition, and the doctor said that he had some scratches and bruises on his arm and the rest of his body. Therefore, the accuser filed a lawsuit against the accused. The accused violated the attack in the Criminal Law, number 375. What’s your plea

en-US	I plead not guilty.
zh-TW	無罪答辯。

zh-TW	今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
en-US	Today is preparatory procedure. The court will check and confirm the evidence used in this case. The prosecutor and the accused can talk about their opinion based on the evidence. Today the accused doesn’t have lawyer, so he will speak for himself. Do you understand the procedure?

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand. 

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也了解。

zh-TW	請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
en-US	Prosecutor, please check and confirm the evidence used in this case and ask questions.

zh-TW	被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
en-US	The accused, you have some argument and therefore have physical confrontation with the accuser at 7:50 p.m. on June 18, 2020. You have confrontation because your motorcycle was moved. In the evidence used in this case, that is, page 8 in Investigatory Record 1, there is a statement made in the police station. According to the statement you made in the police station, you went home at about 6:30 p.m. After you parked your motorcycle, you went upstairs. After you had a dinner, you look out of the window and saw someone at the downstairs was moving your motorcycle, so you went downstairs to check the situation. When you walked downstairs you saw… 大明張, who is the accuser of this case, was moving your motorcycle. Therefore, you asked the accuser why he moved your motorcycle, and the accuser said that your motorcycle had blocked his car. You should not park the motorcycle here, so he moved the motorcycle. Because you didn’t agree the other party’s answer, so you have an argument with the accuser. Is it right?

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
zh-TW	是的，那基本上是當時發生的情況。我想強調這已經不是第一次我們因為停車的關係發生口角。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the quarrel on the motorcycle parking space between both parties was not happened for the first time?

en-US	I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
zh-TW	我住在這個社區已經至少有八個月了，告訴人在沒有原因的情況下…移動我的摩托車已經超過一次了。他只是不喜歡我把摩托車停在那裡，但是他沒有任何理由去做這件事。 在社區，每個人都有權利把車子停在沒有人停的地方。

zh-TW	以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
en-US	Have you ever been to police station to report the incident like such case?

en-US	When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences. 
zh-TW	我們之前發生口角的時候，我都會避免發生肢體衝突，有時候我並不介意我的摩托車被移，有時候我會假裝沒有這件事發生。對於告訴人回答，我是從來沒有去和警察報警，其他鄰居也有類似的經驗。

zh-TW	在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
en-US	In your community, does the parking of the motorcycle have the certain space?

en-US	No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
zh-TW	沒有，任何人都可以停在沒有人停的空位上，是先到先有的概念。

zh-TW	所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
en-US	So for the parking of the motorcycle, can everyone park if the space is available?

en-US	Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
zh-TW	是的，只要有空位，任何人都可以去停車。

zh-TW	那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
en-US	Then, does the parking space have some parking slot?

en-US	Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
zh-TW	沒錯，我們的市政府有畫超過十個位置讓摩托車停放

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
en-US	According to page 24 in Investigatory Record, the picture shows that there are many parking spaces for motorcycle in their community. They have parking slots. Please confirm.

en-US	 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
zh-TW	是的，在這片裡面有我們社區的摩托車停車格。

zh-TW	那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
en-US	Why did your quarrel at that day become physical confrontation?

en-US	When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
zh-TW	當我從樓上看到有人移動我的摩托車，我就下樓來確認。就像我剛剛說的，已經不只一次有人移動我的摩托車了，我真的不喜歡這樣的事發生。當我下樓時，我看見告訴人的手放在我的摩托車把手上面，我就問他在做什麼，他沒有回我，於是我就向前想要制止他。

zh-TW	所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that he was going to move your motorcycle, and you wanted to stop him, so you have physical confrontation with him?

en-US	Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
zh-TW	沒錯，當我出手抓住我摩托車的把手，他也沒有停止抓著我的把手。

zh-TW	你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
en-US	Do you remember who did this thing first?

en-US	I believe I tried to push his hands away.
zh-TW	我記得我是要把他的手推開。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
en-US	Please refer to page 8 in Investigatory Record about the record from the police. In line 10 on page 9 the accuser used his hand to hold the handlebars. He didn’t release his hands and he wanted to move the motorcycle. The accused tried to pushed his hands away. You said that you tried to push his hands away. Do you mean this action?

en-US	Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
zh-TW	沒錯，這是在事件發生之後我到警局做的筆錄。

zh-TW	在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
en-US	What’s the accuser’s reaction when you pushed away his hand

en-US	He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
zh-TW	他沒有移動，他反而是更用力的握著我的摩托車把手。

zh-TW	所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the other party didn’t put away his hands; instead, he grabbed the handlebars…tightly?

en-US	Yes.
zh-TW	沒錯。

zh-TW	接下來發生什麼事呢？
en-US	What happened next?

en-US	Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
zh-TW	從他的肢體語言來看，他並不想要放手，所以我推了他的肩膀，希望他可以將手放開。

zh-TW	因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
en-US	Because of this, you pushed his shoulder. Is it right?

en-US	Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
zh-TW	是的，我推了他的肩膀。

zh-TW	你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
en-US	Do you think at that time you pushed him with much force?

en-US	No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
zh-TW	沒有，我只是輕輕的推一下，就像是我們平常會推推別人的情況。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
en-US	Please refer to page 48 in the Investigatory Record. This is a medical evidence from Lian-He hospital. In the hospital diagnosis, there are multiple scratched and bruises on accuser’s body and his arm. Do you know how this injury happened? Is that because you pushed him?

en-US	I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
zh-TW	我不知道這些瘀青跟挫傷是怎麼造成的，那不是我造成的。

zh-TW	有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
en-US	Is there anyone who can prove what you said about the situation happened at the night on that day?

en-US	My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor. 
zh-TW	那天晚上我女友在家，他知道我下樓，他也知道我和告訴人之間發生了什麼事。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that your girlfriend had seen what happened at that day?

en-US	She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
zh-TW	她有下樓來並且介入我們的肢體衝突，她…拿起手機拍下影片，以免我們需要影片來知道發生了甚麼事。

zh-TW	準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
en-US	Please said more precisely when your girlfriend went downstairs and tried to use her cellphone to take a film.

en-US	She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
zh-TW	她在我第一次要嘗試去抓我的摩托車把手時到達了現場。

zh-TW	後來她有拍成功嗎？
en-US	Did she take the film successfully?

en-US	No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
zh-TW	沒有，當我女朋友拿出手機時，告訴人就警告她不要這樣做，但告訴人其實沒有權利這樣制止她。

zh-TW	那我的問題先問到這裡。
en-US	My question will end here.

zh-TW	今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
en-US	The accused, today is the preliminary preparatory procedure. Is there further evidence you want the court to investigate for you before the next court date?

en-US	Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day. 
zh-TW	有，我希望法院能夠調閱當天的兩台監視器，看看監視器裡的畫面。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
en-US	Do you mean that there are CCTV clips at the alley of your community, and you hope us to request for the CCTV clips? If yes, can you tell us which place or area you want us to request the CCTV clips? Can you give us the certain time?

en-US	I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
zh-TW	我當天是在大約晚上7點40的時候下樓，所以我希望法院可以調查7點半到8點10分左右的監視器影片。

zh-TW	檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have anything to add about the accused want to request the CCTV clips? 

zh-TW	沒有意見。
en-US	No, I don’t.

zh-TW	今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？
en-US	The preparatory procedure toady is dismissed. The next court date will set to be at 2:30 p.m. on August 8, 2020. On that day we will check the content of the CCTV clips and ask questions to both parties. Prosecutor and accused, do you have any further question.

zh-TW	沒有。
en-US	No, I don’t.

en-US	No. 
zh-TW	我也沒有，謝謝。

zh-TW	那今天開庭到此結束，請在簽完筆錄後離席，謝謝。
en-US	Th court is dismissed today. The accused, please sign the court script and you may leave.

zh-TW	是的我了解了。

zh-TW	請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the details of the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	被告Steven Knox於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在其自家門口 （地址為：新北市板橋區長江路 23號6樓），因其摩托車被挪動而與鄰居（即告訴人）發生口角，進而產生肢體衝突。經告訴人至醫院驗傷，醫師診斷為手臂、身體多處挫傷、瘀青，後被提告。檢察官起訴被告違反刑法375條之傷害罪，被告做何答辯？
en-US	The incident happened at 7:50 pm, on June 18th, 2020. On that day, the defendant was at the door of his house. The contact address is Floor 6, No. 23, Changjiang Road, Banqiao District, New Taipei City. Since the motorcycle of the accused was moved, so he had an argument with his neighbor. Further, they had physical confrontation after that. Afterwards, the accuser went to the hospital and check his injuries, and he was diagnosed that his arm and his body had multiple bruises and injuries, so the defendant is violated…is prosecuted…is suspected of violating the criminal law 375 of attack crime. …?

en-US	I plead not guilty.
zh-TW	我沒有罪。

zh-TW	今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
en-US	Today we are here for a preparatory procedure and the court will first show you the evidence. Furthermore, the prosecutor and the defendant can show your stance or your opinion. Today, the defendant didn’t hire a lawyer, so he will make statement himself. Procedurally, do both parties understand?

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也了解了。

zh-TW	請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
en-US	Prosecutor, please show the evidence and pose questions.

zh-TW	被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
en-US	The defendant at 7:50 pm, on June 18th, 2020, you were at the door of your house and you had a quarrel with your neighbor because of your motorcycle was moved. After that, the situation evolved into physical confrontation. As for the checking and confirmation of the evidence used in this case, we can look at the investigatory record on page 8, there are statements made at the police station. At the police station, and in the statement, you said that around 6:30 pm, you arrived at your house and after you parked your motorcycle, you went upstairs. After you had dinner, and you looked down from the window, you saw that there was a person who was about to move your motorcycle, so you went downstairs and checked the situation. When you went downstairs you encountered the accuser, 張大明, he was removing your motorcycle. So you asked the accuser why do you have to remove my motorbike, and the accuser said that because the motorbike blocked his car and he shouldn’t park his motorbike there, so the accuser removed the motorbike. The defendant, since you disagree with the accuser, so you had a quarrel.

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
zh-TW	基本上就是事發的原因。我想強調的是，這不是我們第一次因為移動車子的事而發生口角了。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you both had a quarrel upon the issue of parking space, and it was not the first time, right?

en-US	I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
zh-TW	我已經住在這個社區至少八個月了，那告訴人也是不止一次挪動我的摩托車，而且每次都是無緣無故的。他就只是不喜歡我把摩托車停在那裡，他根本沒有任何立場可以這樣做。所有住在這個社區的人都有權利把車停在可停的地方。

zh-TW	以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
en-US	Have you ever been to the police station for such kind of incident and to have to make a statement?

en-US	When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences. 
zh-TW	我們之前發生口角的時候，我都會盡量的避免衝突，有時候我還不在意他挪動我的摩托車，那也有一些時候我會假裝什麼事都沒發生。要回答這個問題，就是我都沒有去警察局備案過，但其他鄰居有發生過類似的事情。

zh-TW	在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
en-US	In your community, are there particular parking spaces for the motorbikes?

en-US	No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
zh-TW	沒有，我們沒有固定的停放位置，只要有空間就可以停放，也就是採取先到先有的方式。

zh-TW	所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that if there are any parking spaces or any empty spaces, everyone is OK to park there, right?

en-US	Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
zh-TW	沒錯，只要有空位大家就可以停車。

zh-TW	那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
en-US	Are there any slots on your parking spot?

en-US	Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
zh-TW	是的，市府有畫超過10個專屬機車的停車格。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
en-US	In the investigator and record page 45, there is a picture and the picture shows that in your community, every motorcycle has their own marked parking slot, the defendant, please confirm.

en-US	 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
zh-TW	是的，照片裡面就顯示了我們社區的摩托車都有專屬停車格。

zh-TW	那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
en-US	So on that day, why did you... how did the quarrel evolve into physical confrontation?

en-US	When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
zh-TW	當我看到我的摩托車被挪動時，我正站在樓上看，所以我就趕快衝下樓察看。就像我剛剛說的，這已經不是第一次有人移動我的摩托車了，所以我那次真的不想要再忍了。當我下樓的時候，我看到告訴人把他的手放在我的機車把手上，我就問他說：「你在做什麼！」但他並沒有回我，所以我就衝上前試圖要阻止他。

zh-TW	所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
en-US	What you meant was when you stepped forward and tried to stop the plaintiff, so you pushed against each other, right?

en-US	Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
zh-TW	沒錯，當我將我的手放在機車把手上的時候，告訴人並沒有把手鬆開。

zh-TW	你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
en-US	Did you remember who made the move first?

en-US	I believe I tried to push his hands away.
zh-TW	我記得那時候我嘗試要把他的手推開

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
en-US	In investigatory record, one on page 8, there is a inquiry made at the police station. On page 9, line 10, you said that the other party was grabbing the handlebars tightly and you tried to push his hands away. As you mentioned, you said that you made the move first, is that moved this move?

en-US	Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
zh-TW	沒錯，那就是我在事發過後做的筆錄。

zh-TW	在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
en-US	When you were pushing away his hands, what was his reaction?

en-US	He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
zh-TW	他並沒有鬆開手，反而更用力地抓住把手。

zh-TW	所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
en-US	Therefore, you mean that the accused not only let go the handlebars. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars with much force.

en-US	Yes.
zh-TW	沒錯。

zh-TW	接下來發生什麼事呢？
en-US	What happened next?

en-US	Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
zh-TW	因為他的肢體語言告訴我說他並不想要放開，所以我就推了他的肩膀，希望他可以鬆開把手。

zh-TW	因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
en-US	Therefore, you pushed his shoulder, right?

en-US	Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
zh-TW	是的，我有推他的肩膀。

zh-TW	你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
en-US	Did you pushed his shoulders tightly...with much force?

en-US	No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
zh-TW	沒有我只是輕輕地，像告知性的推他那樣，就像我們平常提醒別人一樣。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
en-US	The following is the investigatory record one, page 48, it is a diagnosis from the city Union Hospital. In the diagnosis, the doctor pointed out that on the body and arms of the plaintiff, there were multiple bruises and scratches, so is your pushing his shoulders caused this injury?

en-US	I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
zh-TW	我根本不知道這些瘀青還有傷口是哪裡來的，我根本什麼都沒做。

zh-TW	有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
en-US	Is there any witness can clarify the situation that day？

en-US	My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor. 
zh-TW	當天我的女朋友在家，她也知道我下樓來查看，而且她也很了解我和鄰居之前發生過的事。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
en-US	You meant that your girlfriend saw the situation and the process？

en-US	She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
zh-TW	當我們衝突發生到一半的時候，我女友就下樓了，當時她用手機將事發過程錄影下來，以便我們證明事發過程。

zh-TW	準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
en-US	Precisely speaking, what was the exact time did your girlfriend came to the spot and used her cell phone to record everything?

en-US	She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
zh-TW	就在我第一次嘗試要去握機車把手的時候，我女朋友就到了。

zh-TW	後來她有拍成功嗎？
en-US	Afterwards, did she film the situation successfully?

en-US	No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
zh-TW	沒有，當我女朋友要把手機拿出來錄影的時候，告訴人就警告他說不要拍，但他根本沒有權力這樣做。

zh-TW	那我的問題先問到這裡。
en-US	So my questions will temporarily ends here.

zh-TW	今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
en-US	The defendant, today we are here for a preliminary preparatory procedure, before the next court date, do you have anything to investigate, and the can court can investigate for you on your behalf.

en-US	Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day. 
zh-TW	是的，我想要要求法院幫我檢視當天錄到事發過程的兩支監視器。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
en-US	You meant that there were CCTVs in front of your alley, so you want us to check the CCTV clips, right? If yes, what exact section or segment you want us to check for you and extract for you?

en-US	I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
zh-TW	我當時大約在晚上7:40分的時候下樓，所以我希望法院可以幫我調閱大概是7:30到8:10之間的錄影畫面。

zh-TW	檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
en-US	Prosecutor, about the request from the defendant of examining the CCTV clips, what do you have to say?

zh-TW	沒有意見。
en-US	No, I rest.

zh-TW	今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？
en-US	The preparatory procedure today is dismissed here. The next court date is set on August 8, 2020 at the time of 2:30 PM. On that day, we will examine the CCTV clips and the content. Further, we will inquire both parties to make your own statements. Prosecutor and the defendant, do you have anything to add?

zh-TW	沒有。
en-US	No, I rest.

en-US	No. 
zh-TW	不，我也沒有，謝謝你。

zh-TW	那今天開庭到此結束，請在簽完筆錄後離席，謝謝。

The accused, Steven Knocks,… Again… The incident took place at six floor number 23 Changjinag Rd, Banchiao District, New Taipei city. There was the accused, Steven Knocks’s home. At the time, because Steven Knocks’s motorcycle was moved by the neighbor, so they had a quarrel and then the quarrel becomes a physical confrontation.After the accident happened, the accuser went to the hospital to check for the injuries. The doctor stated that there are multiple bruises and injuries on the hands and on the arms and on the body. So, the accused had committed the Crime Law… number 335, the injury crime. So, what is your plea?

en-US	I plead not guilty.
zh-TW	我沒有罪。

zh-TW	今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
en-US	Today’s procedure is the preparatory procedure. The court will provide parts of the evidence, so…both parties can…state your problems or questions about the incident…evidence.Today, the accused didn’t have a lawyer, so…he will…he will make statement by himself, is that ok with you?

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, the prosecutor understands.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也懂了。

zh-TW	請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
en-US	Prosecutor, please provide the evidence and ask questions about the incident.

zh-TW	被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
en-US	The accused, at 7:50 p.m., June 18th, 2020, you had a quarrel with your neighbor because of…because of the removal of the motorcycle in front of your home. …And then the quarrel become…became a physical confrontation.The first evident is on page 8 of the investigatory record, that is the statements made at the police station.According to what you stated in the police station, you got home at about 6:30 p.m., after you parked your motorcycle, you entered your home and went upstair.After you had dinner, you look…to the first floor, and you saw someone moving your motorcycle and then you immediately went there to understand what was happening.After you went downstair, you saw Chang Da-ming, the accuser of this case, moving your motorcycle.You asked him, why he…You asked him about why he moved your motorcycle. And he answered, it was because your motorcycle blocked his car, and besides you were not supposed to park your motorcycle there. And that’s why he moved your motorcycle.You two had a quarrel because you didn’t accept his statement. Is that true?

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
zh-TW	呃…對…基本上事情就是這麼經過的。我得說，這並不是我們第一次因為停摩托車的問題起口角。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
en-US	You mean it was not the first time you two had a quarrel about where to park the motorcycle?

en-US	I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
zh-TW	我在那個社區已經住了大概八個月…在這之間告訴人有很多次都未經任何提示或說明就亂移我的摩托車。他就是不喜歡我把摩托車停在那裡，但是他沒有任何立場以及理由去做這件事。住在這個社區裡面的人本來就有權力把車停在…把車子或摩托車停在空位上，只要那個位子是可以的。

zh-TW	以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
en-US	Have you ever been the police station for record for such incident?

en-US	When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences. 
zh-TW	當我們起口角的時候，我都會盡全力避免有進一步的衝突，很多時候我也不會去在乎他亂移我的摩托車，有時候我甚至會裝作我不知道。那麼回到你的問題，我從來沒有在警察局備案過，但是其他得鄰居其實有遇到類似的情況。

zh-TW	在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
en-US	In your community, are there any stable parking slots for motorcycle?

en-US	No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
zh-TW	沒有，基本上只要有空格我們就能把車子停在裡面，那這個概念就有點像是你先到就可以先停。

zh-TW	所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
en-US	So, about the parking of motorcycles. You mean that one park his or her motorcycle whenever there is an empty space, right?

en-US	Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
zh-TW	是的，只要有空位就可以把摩托車停進去。

zh-TW	那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
en-US	So, about the parking spaces, are they the parking slots, that means… that means… are there any lines and blocks on it?

en-US	Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
zh-TW	沒有錯，是政府有在那裏畫了超過十個摩托車的停車格。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
en-US	According to page 24 of the investigatory record, in the picture there are actually parking slots in your community, the accused, please check the picture.

en-US	 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
zh-TW	是的，照片裡面就是我們社區的摩托車停車格。

zh-TW	那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
en-US	At that day, how come your quarrel become a physical confrontation?

en-US	When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
zh-TW	當時我在樓上，當我看到有人在移我摩托車的時候，我馬上就衝到樓下。如我剛剛所說的，這並不是第一次有人移我的摩托車，而在那天晚上，我覺得我不想再忍下去了。我下樓的時候看到告訴人正抓著我的把手，所以我走向前問他說他到底在做甚麼，但是他沒有回答，於是我就出手阻止他繼續動我的摩托車。

zh-TW	所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
en-US	You mean…you two had…physical contact like pushing because you want him to stop moving your motorcycle, right?

en-US	Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
zh-TW	沒錯，在我出手要拿回我的摩托車把手的時候，他也沒有放手。

zh-TW	你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
en-US	Do you remember…do you remember…how it begin…begin like who hit who first?

en-US	I believe I tried to push his hands away.
zh-TW	我記得是我先想要把他的手推開。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
en-US	…In the investigatory record page 8, the question and answer in the police station.On page 9 line 10, you stated that the accuser tried to force to move your motorcycle, so you pushed his hands away from your handle bar.You said you are the first one started the physical confrontation, is that what you mean?

en-US	Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
zh-TW	沒錯，這是我在事件發生以後在警察局提供的筆錄。

zh-TW	在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
en-US	When you pushed the other party’s hand away, what was his reaction?

en-US	He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
zh-TW	他沒有鬆手，他甚至掐得更用力。

zh-TW	所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
en-US	You mean, the other party grabbed the handle bar of your motorcycle even more tightly instead of letting it go, right?

en-US	Yes.
zh-TW	沒有錯。

zh-TW	接下來發生什麼事呢？
en-US	Then what happened next?

en-US	Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
zh-TW	因為他的肢體語言告訴我，他並沒有要鬆手，所以我接下來推他的肩膀，希望他可以因此放手。

zh-TW	因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
en-US	As a result, you pushed his shoulder, right?

en-US	Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
zh-TW	沒錯，我推了他的肩膀。

zh-TW	你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
en-US	Did you do that with… a strong force or not?

en-US	No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
zh-TW	沒有，我只是輕輕地推一下，大概就是我們平常制止別人的時候會用的那個力道。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
en-US	Let’s move to page 48 of the investigatory record that’s is the therapy statement of 聯合hospital.In the statement of the doctor, … he stated that there are multiple bruises and contusions on the accuser’s body and arm. Is that what you caused? Is that caused because you pushed him?

en-US	I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
zh-TW	我也不知道那些瘀青跟傷是怎麼造成的，我真的不知道，那不是我做的。

zh-TW	有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
en-US	Is there any witness of what happened that day, in other words, is there anyone can explain what happened that night for you?

en-US	My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor. 
zh-TW	那晚我和我女朋友在一起，她也在我家，所以她也知道我下樓去，那麼她也知道我和告訴人之間發生過的事情。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that your girlfriend witnessed what happened that night?

en-US	She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
zh-TW	在我們發生衝突了以後，我女朋友也來到樓下，並且她原本也想要用手機錄影 以防我們以後要…證據來證明說那晚發生了甚麼事

zh-TW	準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
en-US	Please state more precisely when did your girlfriend came up…down stair and try to film the whole confrontation by her phone?

en-US	She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
zh-TW	她在我第一次要奪回我的把手的時候就下來了。

zh-TW	後來她有拍成功嗎？
en-US	Did she successfully film the confrontation?

en-US	No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
zh-TW	沒有，在她一把手機拿出來，告訴人就警告她不准這樣做，但是他明明就沒有權利這樣要求。

zh-TW	那我的問題先問到這裡。
en-US	Then, that’s the end of my questions.

zh-TW	今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
en-US	The accused, today’s case is the primary…preparatory procedure, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day. 
zh-TW	有的，我希望能夠幫我調閱當天…的…兩台監視器裡面的畫面

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
en-US	You mean there are CCTV in your comm and you want us to investigate the clip for you?If that is true, can you tell the specific area or…more specifically when… I mean when the incident the happened.

en-US	I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
zh-TW	我記得我當天大概是在晚上七點三十分下樓的，所以我希望法院可以幫我調閱晚上七點三十到八點十分左右的畫面。

zh-TW	檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any question about the accused wanting to investigate the CCTV clips?

zh-TW	沒有意見。
en-US	I rest.

zh-TW	今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也了解

zh-TW	請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
en-US	Prosecuter, please show the evidence and ask the question.

zh-TW	被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
en-US	The defendant, you have the argument with your neighbor then you have the physical confrontation at your home at 7:50 p.m. on June 18th in 2020. First evidence is on the investigatory file page 8. There is record on the police station. In the investigatory record, you said that you came home at 6:30 p.m. and you parked your motorbike. Then, you go upstairs. After you finished your dinner, you saw someone was moving your motorbike. Therefore, you go downstairs to check out. When you came downstairs, you found out that the accuser, Chang da-min was moving your motorbike. You ask the accuse why you’re moving my motorbike. The accuser answered that because your motorbike was blocking my way of my car. And you shouldn’t parked your motorbike on that position. Therefore, I move your motorbike. Because you are not agree with the answer of the accuser. So you have the argument about this, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
zh-TW	是的，這就是基本上發生的事情過程。 我只是想強調這不是我和他因為我的摩托車的位置第一次有爭吵了

zh-TW	你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that you and the accuser argue with your position of the motorbike many times?

en-US	I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
zh-TW	我離開這個社區已經八個月了。在這段時間裡面，告訴人已經想要移動我的摩托車超過一次了。他只是不喜歡我將我的摩托車放在那個位置。但他沒有立場這麼做。在這個社區裡面，每個人都有權利去停放他的摩托車，只要有空位。

zh-TW	以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
en-US	Have you ever been to the police station for the case because of the moving of motorbike?

en-US	When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences. 
zh-TW	之前發生爭吵的時候，我會盡量避免和告訴人發生爭吵。有時候我會阻止它移動我的摩托車。有時候我會當作沒有發生一樣。先回答你剛剛的問題，我沒有去警局備案過。其他鄰居也有發生相同的問題。

zh-TW	在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
en-US	In your society, is there the accurate place for parking motorbike?

en-US	No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
zh-TW	沒有，我們可以停放在任何有空位的地方，這是一個先到先有的權利。

zh-TW	所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
en-US	Concerning the issue of parking of the motorbike. If there are the empty place, anyone can park his motorbike, right?

en-US	Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
zh-TW	沒錯，只要有空位任何人都可以停放他的摩托車。

zh-TW	那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
en-US	Are there parking slot on your motorbike parking place?

en-US	Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
zh-TW	是的，市政府有在我們的社區劃設十幾個專為摩托車設計的停車格。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
en-US	According to the investigatory record page 24. The photo shows that there are parking slots in the defendant’s community. Defendant, please confirm it. 

en-US	 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
zh-TW	是的，這照片裡我的社區裡有位了摩托車而設的停車格。

zh-TW	那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
en-US	On that day, why you have the physical confrontation after you had the argument with each other?

en-US	When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
zh-TW	當我在樓上看到有人正在移動我的摩托車時，我就馬上衝下樓想要查看發生了什麼事。 讓像我剛說的，這已經不是他第一次移動我的摩托車了。但我實在是已經忍無可忍了。當我下樓時，我看到告訴人把他的手放在我的摩托車手把上。我問他你到底在做什麼。但他沒有回答。所以我想要向前去阻止他移動我的摩托車。

zh-TW	所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because he trying to move your motorbike. Then you want to stop him. Therefore, you have some physical confrontation, right?

en-US	Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
zh-TW	沒錯，當我想要將我的摩托車拿回來的時候他並沒有放手。

zh-TW	你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
en-US	Do you remember who had the physical to each other first?

en-US	I believe I tried to push his hands away.
zh-TW	我記得我想要把他的手推開

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
en-US	The statement made at the police station is on the investigatory record page 8. On the page 9 line 10. You have mention that the accuser grabbed your motorbike handlebar. Therefore, your try to remove his hands on the handlebar. You just mentioned that you take the action first. Does that mean the movement? 

en-US	Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
zh-TW	是的，這就是在事發後我在警局做的筆錄。

zh-TW	在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
en-US	When you remove the hands of the accuser. What’s his reaction?

en-US	He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
zh-TW	他沒有移動而且甚至更用力地抓住我的機車把手。

zh-TW	所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the accuser did not let his hands go? And he grab the handle bar with much force.

en-US	Yes.
zh-TW	是的，沒錯

zh-TW	接下來發生什麼事呢？
en-US	Then, what’s happened? 

en-US	Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
zh-TW	因為他的肢體語言告訴我說他不會放開我的摩托車。所以我推了他的肩膀迫使他放開我的摩托車。

zh-TW	因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
en-US	So you pushed his shoulder, right?

en-US	Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
zh-TW	沒錯，我推了他的肩膀。

zh-TW	你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
en-US	Did you think you push him with much force?

en-US	No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
zh-TW	沒有我只是輕輕的推了一下，就像一般的人在催促會或是不想要你做什麼事情的時候一樣。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
en-US	Then we will ask the investigatory record page 48. This is the evidence of the diagnosis of the city hospital. In the doctor’s diagnosis evidence. There are multiple bruise and injuries on the accuser’s body and his hand. Did you made it because of your pushing him? 

en-US	I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
zh-TW	我不知道那些擦傷還有那些瘀青是怎麼發生的，我並沒有做這些事。

zh-TW	有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
en-US	Is there anyone can prove your statement and the situation at the incident?

en-US	My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor. 
zh-TW	我的女朋友在家只有他知道我和鄰居事發的經過

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
en-US	Did you mean that your girlfriend witness the procedure of the incident?

en-US	She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
zh-TW	他在我們爭吵過程的中間就下來了。她用手機拍下了我們的爭吵過程以防之後我想要證明我的清白

zh-TW	準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
en-US	Please be accurate. When were your girlfriend arrived the situation. Did she filmed the incident with her cellphone?

en-US	She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
zh-TW	他抵達事發現場當我第一次想要阻止他移動我的摩托車的時候

zh-TW	後來她有拍成功嗎？
en-US	Did she film the incident successfully?

en-US	No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
zh-TW	沒有，當我女友拿出手機的時候。告訴人就警告我女友不能拍，但是他沒有權力這麼說。

zh-TW	那我的問題先問到這裡。
en-US	Then my questions will end here.

zh-TW	今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
en-US	The defendant, today is the preparatory procedure. Before our next court, do you need the court to investigate any evidence for you?

en-US	Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day. 
zh-TW	是的，我想要要求檢方去查閱當天事發經過路口的兩句監視器畫面

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
en-US	You mean that there are monitors on your street. so you want us to have the CCTV clips, right? If yes, which area or when should we retrieve the CCTV clips?

en-US	I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
zh-TW	我記得我是7點50分下樓的，所以我希望法院可以去調閱7點半到8點之間的監視器畫面。

zh-TW	檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have anything to add with the examine of CCTV clips?

zh-TW	被告Steven Knox於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在其自家門口 （地址為：新北市板橋區長江路 23號6樓），因其摩托車被挪動而與鄰居（即告訴人）發生口角，進而產生肢體衝突。經告訴人至醫院驗傷，醫師診斷為手臂、身體多處挫傷、瘀青，後被提告。檢察官起訴被告違反刑法375條之傷害罪，被告做何答辯？

en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請檢察官提示證據，並發問。

zh-TW	被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
en-US	The accused, did the incident happened at 7:50 p.m. June 18th, 2020, in front of your house? You have quarrels with your neighbor, which turned out to be the physical confrontation, right?In the first evidence which is the statement made in the Police Station, which are also the investigatory record No.1.According to the statement you made in the Police Station, you mentioned that you went home at around 6:30. After parking your motorbike, you went upstairs.After you finished your dinner, you looked out the window and found out that someone was trying to move your motorbike.When you went down the stairs, you found out that Da-Ming Chang, the accuser of this case, was moving your motorbike.When you asked why he move your motorbike, the accuser answered that because your motorbike was blocking his car, and that’s why he was moving your motorbike.Because you disagreed with his statements, that’s why the quarrels happened.

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
zh-TW	是，這基本上就是事情的經過。我還要強調一點，像這種情況並不是第一次發生，我之前也要求過他移動摩托車。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
en-US	You mean that this was not the first argument with respect to the parking location of the motorbike?

en-US	I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
zh-TW	我已經在這個社區住了八個月的時間，但告訴人並非第一次試圖移動我的摩托車。他只是很討厭我把車子停在那邊，但他沒有任何理由這麼做。在社區裡，每個人都有權利去停放自己的汽車或機車在有空位的地方。

zh-TW	以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
en-US	Then, have both party went to the Police station and have the identical record for the same incident?

en-US	When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences. 
zh-TW	我們之前的確有過口角，但都沒有發展成肢體衝突。有時候，我甚至會對摩托車被移走的這件事視而不見。先回答前一個問題，我從來沒有到警局備過案，但我知道有些鄰居也發生過相同的問題。

zh-TW	在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
en-US	Do you have the regular places that everyone parks their motorbike in your community?

en-US	No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
zh-TW	沒有，事實上，我們可以把車停在任何有空位的停車格裡，基本上就是先到先有的概念。

zh-TW	所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
en-US	In terms of the parking of the motorbike, basically you can park your motorbike wherever you want if there is a place.

en-US	Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
zh-TW	沒錯，只要有看到空位，每個人都可以將他的車輛停在裡面。

zh-TW	那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
en-US	Is there any block on where the car parking?

en-US	Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
zh-TW	有的，市政府有畫了十多個停車個在那邊。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
en-US	According to the investigatory record on p.24, there’s a photo shows there are parking lot in the accused’s community. Please check these photos.

en-US	 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
zh-TW	是的，在照片裡的是我家附近的機車停車格。

zh-TW	那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
en-US	Then, how did the situation turned out the be the physical confrontation after the argument.

en-US	When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
zh-TW	當我在樓上看到有陌生人在移動我的摩托車時，我就趕緊下樓察看。就像我剛說的，有人移動我摩托車已經不是第一次，那天下午，我覺得我已經忍無可忍了。當我下樓時，我看到告訴人正把手放在我的機車上，問他他在幹什麼，但對方沉默不語，於是我就上前阻止他。

zh-TW	所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that when you were trying to move your motorbike, and you came up to stop him. That’s the reason why the physical confrontation happened?

en-US	Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
zh-TW	沒錯，當我上前準備抓住我的摩托車把手時，他卻沒有放手。

zh-TW	你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
en-US	Do you still remember who was the first one attack the other?

en-US	I believe I tried to push his hands away.
zh-TW	我記得那個時候我試圖把他的手推開。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
en-US	The statement made at the Police Station, it’s also investigatory record one is as follows.On P.9, line 10, you mentioned that the other party grabbed the motorbike tightly, you tried to let him take the hand out of the handlebars.You just mentioned that you’re the first one to attack him, do you mean that was such behavior you move?

en-US	Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
zh-TW	是的，這就跟我在警局裡提到的一樣，在衝突發生之後。

zh-TW	在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
en-US	What’s his reaction when you tried to take his hands out your motorbike?

en-US	He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
zh-TW	他沒有要放手的打算，反之，他抓得更用力了。

zh-TW	所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
en-US	You mean that he didn’t tried to move his hand: rather, he grabbed the handlebar more tightly?

en-US	Yes.
zh-TW	null

zh-TW	接下來發生什麼事呢？
en-US	And what happened next?

en-US	Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
zh-TW	從他的肢體語言來看，我相信他終究是不會放手的，所以我就用力推了他的肩膀。

zh-TW	因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
en-US	So, you pushed his shoulder, right?

en-US	Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
zh-TW	沒錯，我推了他的肩膀。

zh-TW	你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
en-US	Do you think that you did it with much force at that time?

en-US	No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
zh-TW	沒有，我只是輕輕地推他，就像我們平常會輕輕地碰一下對方的肩膀，告訴他們去做些什麼事情這樣。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
en-US	Next, let’s look at the p.48 on the investigatory record one, it’s the treatment result came from the Capital United Hospital.According to this file, we can see there are many bruises on the accuser’s body and arms, do you have any idea how did he injured? Does it come from your push on his shoulder?

en-US	I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
zh-TW	我不曉得他身上的那些瘀青是怎麼來的，我認為不是我做的。

zh-TW	有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
en-US	Is there anyone are able to prove what you just mentioned and what happened that evening?

en-US	My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor. 
zh-TW	當天我和我的女朋友待在一起，所以她有看到我下樓，她也很清楚過去我和我那位鄰居之間的衝突。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that your girlfriend witnessed what happened that day?

en-US	She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
zh-TW	我的女朋友在我們爭執到一半的時候就下樓查看，她也試圖拿手機錄下事情發生的經過，以防之後可能會使用到。

zh-TW	準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
en-US	More specifically, what’s the timing that your girlfriend witnessed the incident and tried to film the video.

en-US	She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
zh-TW	就在我第一次試圖要抓住機車把手時，我的女朋友就下來了。

zh-TW	後來她有拍成功嗎？
en-US	Did she film the video she want?

en-US	No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
zh-TW	沒有，當我的女朋友拿出手機時，對方就立馬制止了我的女朋友，說她並沒有權力這麼做。

zh-TW	那我的問題先問到這裡。
en-US	Then, that’s all the questions for you.

zh-TW	今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
en-US	The accused, today is only the preparatory procedure. Do you need to court investigate any evidence for you?

en-US	Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day. 
zh-TW	是的。我希望法院這邊能幫我調出兩個監視器畫面以查看當天的情況。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
en-US	You mean that there are CCTVs in your community, and you’d like to ask the court to find the clips at the time?Can you give us the timing more specifically so that we can know what is the timing of the CCTV clips?

en-US	I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
zh-TW	我記得我當天是在大約晚上7點40分下樓的，我以我希望法院這邊能夠幫我調出七點三十到八點十分的監視器畫面。

zh-TW	檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any opinion about the fact that the accused is going to find the CCTV Clips at that day?

zh-TW	沒有意見。
en-US	No, I do not.

zh-TW	今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的我了解

zh-TW	請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	As stated in the indictment.

zh-TW	被告Steven Knox於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在其自家門口 （地址為：新北市板橋區長江路 23號6樓），因其摩托車被挪動而與鄰居（即告訴人）發生口角，進而產生肢體衝突。經告訴人至醫院驗傷，醫師診斷為手臂、身體多處挫傷、瘀青，後被提告。檢察官起訴被告違反刑法375條之傷害罪，被告做何答辯？
en-US	This incident took place at 7:50 pm on June 18th, 2020. The location is in front of the defendant’s house, which the address is 6th floor, No.23 ChangJiang Street Banqiao District, New Taipei City. The defendant’s motorcycle was moved, and he had some arguments and quarrels with his neighbor, which is the accuser, and caused physical confrontation. After the accuser went to the hospital for medical examination, the doctors that he had… he had many bruises on his arms and body parts. According to the Criminal Law No.375, the accused has constituted attack. The defendant, what’s your plea?

en-US	I plead not guilty.
zh-TW	無罪答辯。

zh-TW	今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
en-US	Today we are here for a preparatory procedure. I will now first offer some evidence. The prosecutor and the defendant can add more details to the evidence offered. For today’s procedure, the defendant did not hire a lawyer, so he will speak on his own behalf. Do you understand?

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes I understand. 

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也充分理解。

zh-TW	請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
en-US	Prosecutor, please show the evidence and ask your questions. 

zh-TW	被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
en-US	The defendant, the incident happened at 7:50 pm on June 18th, 2020 in front of your door. You had a quarrel with your neighbor about moving your motorcycle. At first it was only a little argument, but it became physical confrontation. The first evidence is as stated in page 8 investigatory file. It is the statements made at the police station. As stated in the statements made at the police station, you said that you went home on that day at 6:30 pm. You parked your car and then went home. After that you were having dinner, then you looked downstairs and saw someone moving your motorcycle, so you went downstairs to take a look at what was happening. When you went downstairs, you found out the one who was moving your motorcycle was your neighbor, Da-Ming Chang, which is the accuser. He was moving your motorcycle. You asked the accuser why did he move your motorcycle. The accuser answered that because your motorcycle was blocking his car, and you shouldn’t park your motorcycle at that place, so he moved your motorcycle. Because you disagreed with his statement, so you had quarrels with him, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
zh-TW	是的，基本上那就是事發經過。我想要強調這不是第一次我們因為我的摩托車停放位置吵架。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that both parties have already had arguments about where the motorcycle is parked before?

en-US	I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
zh-TW	我在這個社區已經住了八個月了，告訴人他已經多次嘗試移動我的摩托車。他只是不滿和看不慣我把車子停在那裏。這個社區的所有住戶都有權利可以在這個停車場停放自己的汽車或機車，只要有空位。

zh-TW	以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
en-US	Have you ever been to the police station to report cases about these kinds of arguments?

en-US	When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences. 
zh-TW	之前發生口角的時候我都會盡量避免肢體衝突。有時候我甚至不會在乎他移動我的摩托車，有時候我會假裝沒有看到。回答剛才的問題，我沒有去警局備過案，但其他鄰居有相似的經驗。

zh-TW	在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
en-US	In your community, do the motorcycles have their own specific parking slot?

en-US	No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
zh-TW	沒有，我們基本上是只要有空位就可以停。基本上是採先到先有的制度。

zh-TW	所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
en-US	So about the parking of the motorcycle, everyone can park his or her own motorcycle if there is an empty space, right?

en-US	Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
zh-TW	是的，只要有空位任何人都可以停放他的機車。

zh-TW	那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
en-US	Is there a parking slot at where you park your motorcycle?

en-US	Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
zh-TW	是的，市政府已經有劃分十個特定的機車空位給我們停放。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
en-US	According to the investigatory file page number 24’s picture. In the defendant’s community, the parking spaces for motorcycles indeed have parking slots. The defendant, please check this picture. 

en-US	 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
zh-TW	是的，照片上的確是我社區裡面給摩托車停放的停車格。

zh-TW	那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
en-US	Then how did the arguments you had that day evolve into physical confrontation?

en-US	When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
zh-TW	那天我在樓上看到有人在樓下移動我的機車，所以我就趕下樓看發生什麼事。就像我說的，這已經不是第一次有人移動我的摩托車。那天晚上我就是感覺不想再忍受這樣的事情了。當我下樓時我看到告訴人他雙手緊抓著我的把手。我問他在幹嘛，但他沒有回答我，於是我上前阻擋他的去路。

zh-TW	所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that he was trying to move your motorcycle, and you stepped forward to try to block him, so there was some push and pull between you?

en-US	Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
zh-TW	是的，當我試著想要用雙手我摩托車的把手，他卻沒有放手。

zh-TW	你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
en-US	Then do you remember who started the fight first?

en-US	I believe I tried to push his hands away.
zh-TW	我記得是我先想要把他的手推開。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
en-US	According to the investigatory file page number 8, there are the statements made at the police station. According the tenth line on page 9, the accuser held on the handlebars very tightly, and tried to move away your motorcycle, so you went forward and tried to push away his hands. You just mentioned that you attacked first, did you mean this move?

en-US	Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
zh-TW	是的，這就是我在警局筆錄裡所陳述的。

zh-TW	在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
en-US	After you pushed away his hands, what was the other party’s reaction?

en-US	He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
zh-TW	他沒有因此放手，反而他更用力的握住把手。

zh-TW	所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
en-US	So you mean that the accuser did not let go of the handlebars, but instead grabbed it more tightly, right?

en-US	Yes.
zh-TW	是的沒錯。

zh-TW	接下來發生什麼事呢？
en-US	Then after that, what happened?

en-US	Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
zh-TW	因為他的肢體語言告訴我他不會放開我的把手，所以我就推了一下他的肩膀，想要讓他放手。

zh-TW	因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
en-US	So you pushed his shoulder, right?

en-US	Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
zh-TW	是的，我推了他的肩膀。

zh-TW	你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
en-US	Then do you think that you pushed his shoulder with much force?

en-US	No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
zh-TW	沒有，在我記憶中我只是輕輕推了他的肩膀一下。就像有時候我們希望對方停止動作的時候的輕推。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
en-US	Next we are going to show the 48th page on investigatory file 1. This is a medical receipt according to the Capital United Hospital. In the hospitalization, the accuser’s body and arms had many injuries and bruises. How did that occur, was it because you pushed him?

en-US	I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
zh-TW	我完全不知道那些擦傷還有瘀青是怎麼來的，那不是我造成的。

zh-TW	有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
en-US	Is there anyone who can prove your statements of what you just said? Or about what happened that night?

en-US	My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor. 
zh-TW	當天我的女朋友也在我家，他知道我要下樓查看，他也非常清楚我和我鄰居之前有過這樣的爭執。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that your girlfriend saw what happened that day?

en-US	She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
zh-TW	他在我們爭執的時候就下樓了。他非常堅持要用手機錄下視頻，以便之後需要。

zh-TW	準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
en-US	More specifically speaking, when did your girlfriend arrive at the scene and tried to film?

en-US	She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
zh-TW	他下樓的時候我正第一次試圖要抓住我摩托車的把手

zh-TW	後來她有拍成功嗎？
en-US	Did she successfully film the process of your quarre

en-US	No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
zh-TW	沒有，正當他要把手機拿出來錄影的時候，告訴人告訴他不要這麼做，但告訴人沒有權利制止他。

zh-TW	那我的問題先問到這裡。
en-US	Then I have no further questions.

zh-TW	今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
en-US	The defendant, today is a preliminary preparatory procedure. Before the next court, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate on your behalf?

en-US	Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day. 
zh-TW	有的，我想要請法院查看並調閱那兩個監視器畫面查看當天的事發經過。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
en-US	Do you mean that there are CCTVs placed in your community, and you hope we can retrieve the CCTV clip and take a look? If that is true, can you please say where and when you want us to take a look on the CCTV clip? Can you offer a more specific time?

en-US	I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
zh-TW	我下樓的時候大概是晚上7:40，所以我希望法院可以調閱7:30到8:10的錄影帶。

zh-TW	檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have anything to add on what the defendant asked for retrieving the CCTV clip?

zh-TW	沒有意見。
en-US	I have nothing to add. 

zh-TW	今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？
en-US	The preparatory procedure today is dismissed. The next court will be at 2:30 pm on August 8th, 2020. On the next court, we will investigate the evidence and the CCTV clips and ask both parties about their statements. Prosecutor and the defendant, are there any more questions?

zh-TW	沒有。
en-US	No, I rest.

en-US	No. 
zh-TW	沒有，謝謝。

zh-TW	那今天開庭到此結束，請在簽完筆錄後離席，謝謝。
en-US	The court is dismissed, please sign the court records and you may leave.

The incident happened because the defendant’s motorcycle had moved so the defendant had a quarrel and physical confrontation with his neighbor, the accuser. After the accuser go to hospital and check his injuries, his arm and sever body part is bruised and also hurt. Therefore, the defendant violates the criminal law 375 which is attack.

en-US	I plead not guilty.
zh-TW	無罪答辯

zh-TW	今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
en-US	Today the court will provide the part of the evidence and the prosecutor and the defendant, if you have any opinion, both of you can reflect. In this procedure, the accuser did not hire a lawyer. So he will speak for himself. Do you understand.

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	 Yes, I do.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我也了解 

zh-TW	請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
en-US	Prosecutor. Please provide the evidence and ask the questions.

zh-TW	被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
en-US	The defendant. At 7:50 p.m. on June 18th 2020. In front of your house, you had an argument and which leads to a physical confrontation with your neighbor because of your motorcycle was moved. The first evidence is showed on the trial list page 8 which is the record in the police.According to your record, you got back home at 6:30 pm and then you park your motorcycle in front of your house. And you went up stair. After that, you finished your dinner. And then you saw someone down stair is moving your motorcycle. Then you asked 大明張 why would he move your motorcycle. And he answered that your motorbike was blocked his car. And you should’ve not park your motorbike in that place.Because you cannot agree with his response, so you started the argument right?

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
zh-TW	是的，基本上就是這樣沒錯，但我只想再次強調，這不是我們第一次為了停車糾紛而有發生口角過

zh-TW	你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
en-US	So you mean this is not the first time had an argument about the parking place of your motorbike?

en-US	I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
zh-TW	我在這個社區至少住了八個月以上，在這段期間，告訴人一直試圖的想要移動我的摩托車，他只是看不慣我把摩托車停在那個位子，但他並沒有任何正當理由，任何人住在那個社區都有權利把他們的交通工具停在那個位子，只要它是空的

zh-TW	以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
en-US	Have you ever made a statement at police station because of some argument alike?

en-US	When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences. 
zh-TW	之前有過口角的時候，我都盡量避開衝突，有時我會假裝沒看到，或者是不去在意我的摩托車被移動，至於是否有到警察局做筆錄，我的回答是沒有的，但是鄰居也有相關的經驗

zh-TW	在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
en-US	Is there any regular parking slot in your community?

en-US	No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
zh-TW	並沒有，我們並沒有固定的停車格，只要有位子，縣道的人就能將車子停放在那裏。

zh-TW	所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
en-US	So you can park anywhere available if you see any parking slot.

en-US	Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
zh-TW	沒錯，只要停車格是空的，那麼他們都能將他的摩托車或汽車停放在那

zh-TW	那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
en-US	Are the parking slot has……

en-US	Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
zh-TW	有的，政府有在那附近畫了十幾個停車格

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
en-US	According to the investigatory record one, you can check and confirm the defendant motorbike was parked at the parking slot.

en-US	 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
zh-TW	是的沒錯 照片當中那些的確是機車停車格

zh-TW	那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
en-US	And why the quarrel leads to a physical confrontation at that day

en-US	When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
zh-TW	當我發現我的機車正在被移動時，我利馬衝下樓查看是怎麼一回事，如同我剛剛所說，這不是第一次有人移動我的摩托車了，而剛好在那天下午我不想再忍受了，當我下樓查看時，告訴人的雙手放在把手上移動著它，我也問他他在做甚麼他卻不回答，所以我走向前

zh-TW	所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
en-US	So the confrontation happened because you want to stop him from moving your motorbike

en-US	Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
zh-TW	null

zh-TW	你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
en-US	Do you remember who started the confrontation?

en-US	I believe I tried to push his hands away.
zh-TW	我記得是我想將他的手從把手上移開

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
en-US	Check and confirm the investigatory record of the statement made at the police station. At page nine line ten. The record says that the accuser grabs your motorbike tightly and don’t want let go, so you try to remove his hand from your motorbike. So you said that you started the confrontation which indicate this movement

en-US	Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
zh-TW	是的，這就是我自筆錄當中提到我在衝突發生後所做的事

zh-TW	在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
en-US	What’s the reaction of the accuser when you try to remove his hand from your motorbike?

en-US	He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
zh-TW	他並沒有移開，相反的他更用力的掐握著我的摩托車

zh-TW	所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
en-US	So the accuser did not remove his hand from your motorbike. Instead, he grabs your motorbike even more tightly

en-US	Yes.
zh-TW	是的沒錯

zh-TW	接下來發生什麼事呢？
en-US	Then what happened next?

en-US	Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
zh-TW	從他的肢體上看來他並沒有想要放開我的摩托車，所以我推了他的肩膀，希望他可以離開我的摩托車

zh-TW	因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
en-US	So you push his shoulder because you want him to leave your motorbike?

en-US	Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
zh-TW	是的，我推了他的肩膀

zh-TW	你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
en-US	Do you push his should with much force at that time?

en-US	No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
zh-TW	我並沒有推他推的很大力，我大概就是以平常要別人不做甚麼事情的那種力道

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
en-US	Let’s check and confirm the investigatory record one on page 48. This is the result of 聯合hospital. In the diagnose record. It shows that accuser’s arm and multiple body part have bruises and injuries. Are these injuries caused by the push?

en-US	I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
zh-TW	我完全不曉得這些淤青和挫傷是怎麼造成的，這不是我做的阿

zh-TW	有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
en-US	Is there any one can prove your statement or what happened at that time.

en-US	My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor. 
zh-TW	那個時候我的女友正在家中，她知道我要下樓去查看，也知道我和那位鄰居發生的事

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
en-US	So your girlfriend witness what happened at that day?

en-US	She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
zh-TW	我女友下來察看時,衝突已經開始了，她有拿出手機來拍攝下這些過程，以方之後我們有需要證據來證明

zh-TW	準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
en-US	To be more precisely, when did your girlfriend went down stair and took out her phone and film this incident?

en-US	She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
zh-TW	她下來時，我正好要將伸手握取機車把手

zh-TW	後來她有拍成功嗎？
en-US	Did she film the scene successfully?

en-US	No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
zh-TW	沒有 正當我女友拿出手機拍時，告訴人就制止她，但他並沒有任何權力這麼做

zh-TW	那我的問題先問到這裡。
en-US	There’s no further question.

zh-TW	今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
en-US	The accused. Today is the preliminarily preparatory procedure. Is there any evidence that you would like to ask the court to investigate for you for the next court?

en-US	Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day. 
zh-TW	是的，我想要請法院調閱出當天在那附近兩台監視器的畫面

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
en-US	So you want us to check the two CCTV in your community? So could you tell the court more precisely about which area should we check?

en-US	I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
zh-TW	我是大約在7:40的時候下樓的，所以我希望法院可以調閱7:30分到8:10這段時間的影像

zh-TW	檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have anything to add about the defendant want to check the CCTV?

zh-TW	沒有意見。
en-US	No

zh-TW	今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？
en-US	Today’s preparatory procedure come to an end. And in the next court. We are going to check the CCTV clips. And then ask both party the opinion. Prosecutor and the defendant do you have anything to add?

zh-TW	沒有。
en-US	No, I rest

en-US	No. 
zh-TW	沒有，謝謝

zh-TW	那今天開庭到此結束，請在簽完筆錄後離席，謝謝。
en-US	Then the court is dismiss. Please the defendant go to sign the court script.

en-US	As stated in the indictment.

zh-TW	被告Steven Knox於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在其自家門口 （地址為：新北市板橋區長江路 23號6樓），因其摩托車被挪動而與鄰居（即告訴人）發生口角，進而產生肢體衝突。經告訴人至醫院驗傷，醫師診斷為手臂、身體多處挫傷、瘀青，後被提告。檢察官起訴被告違反刑法375條之傷害罪，被告做何答辯？
en-US	 The incident happened at 7:50 pm on June 18, 2020 and the incident took place in front of the accused’s house, the address is 6 Floor, No.23 Changjiang Road, Banqiao District, New Taipei City. On that day, the motorcycle of the accused was moved, so the accused have some quarrel with his neighborhood, the accuser, and then have physical confrontation. After the accuser went to the hospital, the doctor said that there are many bruises and scratches on the accuser’s arm, so the accuser was going to sue the accused. And according to the Criminal Law No.375, the accused violated the attack. What’s your plea?

en-US	I plead not guilty.
zh-TW	我無罪答辯。

zh-TW	今為準備程序，法庭會先就提示部分證據，檢察官及被告均可就證據部分提出意見，本件被告不申請辯護人，就自行發言，程序上都了解嗎？
en-US	Today is the preparatory procedure, so we will show some evidence first. Prosecutor and the accused, you can add anything you want to say for the evidence. Today the accused didn’t apply a lawyer, so he will state by himself. For the procedure, do you understand?

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也了解。

zh-TW	請檢察官提示證據，並發問。
en-US	Prosecutor, please show the evidence and ask.

zh-TW	被告於於中華民國109年6月18日晚間7點50分在自家門口，與鄰居（即告訴人）因挪動摩托車一事發生口角、爭執，進而衍生成肢體衝突。提示證據一偵券(一)第8頁之警局筆錄。被告你在警局筆錄當中陳述，當天你在晚上六點半回到自家門口，將摩托車停好之後，便上樓。之後用完晚餐時，你往樓下看，發現有人正要挪動你的摩托車，於是立刻下樓查看。當你到樓下的時候，發現是鄰居張大明，也就是告訴人，正在牽你的摩托車。於是你問他，為什麼要挪動你的摩托車，對方回答，因為你的摩托車擋到他的車子，而且你不應該停在那個位置，所以他才要移開你的車。因為不同意對方的回答，你們才會發生口角，是嗎？
en-US	The defendant, at the time of 7:50 pm, June 18, 2020, you had a quarrel and physical confrontation with your neighborhood in front of your house because of the move of your motorcycle. In the investigatory record 1 page 8, on that page there is the statement made at the police station. As the statement stated, you said that you went home at 6:30. After you parked your motorcycle, you went upstairs. After you finished, you looked down from the window and see someone wanted to move your motorcycle. After you went down and checked, you found that your neighborhood, Da Ming Chang, was moving your motorcycle. You asked the accuser why he moved your motorcycle and he replied that your motorcycle was obstacle, and you shouldn’t park at that place. Because you can not accept his statement, so you have argument, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened basically. I just want to emphasize that it was not the first time we argued about the parking issue of my motorbike.
zh-TW	我只是想強調這已經不是第一次為了停車的事情吵架。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，雙方在摩托車停放位置這件事情上，已經不是第一次發生爭執嗎？
en-US	So you mean that it was not the first time that you have argument with each other because of the parking place of the motorcycle.

en-US	I have lived in that community for at least eight months. The plaintiff has more than once tried to move my motorbike without any reason. He just didn’t like the idea that I parked my motorcycle there, but he has no place in that matter. Everyone in the neighborhood has the right to park his/her vehicle if there is available space.
zh-TW	我住在那個社區八個月了，告訴人不只一次的想要移動我的機車，而且都沒有原因。他不喜歡我把我把我的車子停在那哩，但已經沒有其他可以停的地方了。如果有空位的話，社區的每個人都有權利把他們的交通工具停在那個地方，如果有空位的話。

zh-TW	以前曾經到警察局為類似的口角備過案嗎？
en-US	Have you ever reported to the police about this condition.

en-US	When we had quarrels before, I always tried to avoid confrontation. Sometimes, I didn’t mind his removal of my motorcycle. Other times, I would just pretend it didn’t happen. To answer your question, no, I have never filed the cases with the police, but other neighbors also have similar experiences. 
zh-TW	之前發生口角，我都會避免肢體衝突，有時候我並不在意他移動我的車，我甚至會假裝沒發生過這件事。回到你的問題，我並沒有去警察局備案過，但其他鄰居也有發生過類似的經驗。

zh-TW	在你們的社區中，摩托車的停放有一定的位子嗎？
en-US	Are there available parking spaces in your community?

en-US	No, basically we can park in any empty spot. It’s on a first-come-first-serve basis. 
zh-TW	沒有固定的位子，只要有空位就可以停，通常是只要有車位，你就可以先停進去。

zh-TW	所以針對摩托車停放一事，只要有空的位子，就可以停放，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that about the issue parking of motorcycle, everyone can park their motorcycle if there are empty spaces. 

en-US	Yes. If there is an empty spot, anyone can park his/her motorbike there.
zh-TW	 對，只要有空位，每個人都可以停在那裏。

zh-TW	那你們的停放位置有畫停車格嗎？
en-US	In your community, are there any parking slots with lines?

en-US	Yes, the city government has marked more than 10 designated parking spaces for motorcycles.
zh-TW	沒錯，市政府有在我們的社區裡劃很多停車格。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第24頁之照片，照片中顯示，被告社區摩托車停放有畫停車格。請被告確認。
en-US	According to the investigatory record 1 page 24, and there is a photo, the photo shows that in the community, there actually parking slots. The defendant, please make sure of it. 

en-US	 Yes, in the picture are the parking slots for motorcycles in our neighborhood.
zh-TW	是的，照片裡的停車格是讓摩托車停的。

zh-TW	那，你們那一天發生口角之後，為何會演變成肢體衝突？
en-US	What’s your reason that your argument evolved into physical confrontation on that day? 

en-US	When I saw someone was moving my motorcycle from upstairs, I rushed down to check what happened. As I said, it was not the first time that someone moved my motorcycle. I just didn’t feel like tolerating the matter anymore that night. When I went downstairs, I saw the plaintiff placed his hands on the handlebars of my motorbike. I asked him what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I tried to step forward and stop him from moving my motorbike.
zh-TW	當我在樓上看到有人想移動我的摩托車時，我立刻衝了下去。就像我說的，這已經不是第一次，我已經沒辦法再容忍這樣的事情發生了。當我下樓的時候，我看到告訴人正在抓著我摩托車的把手，我問他在做什麼，但他沒有回答，所以我向前想要把我的摩托車拿回來。

zh-TW	所以說，是他要移動你的摩托車，而你上前制止，才會發生推擠情事，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that the accuser was moving your motorcycle, and you stepped forward to stop him so you have some physical confrontation like pushing, right?

en-US	Yes, after I put out my hands and tried to hold the handlebars of my motorcycle, he didn’t let go of them.
zh-TW	是的，當我上前試著抓住我的把手，但他卻緊握著不放

zh-TW	你記得是誰先動手的嗎？
en-US	Do you remember who is the first one to hit the other party?

en-US	I believe I tried to push his hands away.
zh-TW	我記得是我想把他的手挪開我的把手。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第8頁之警局訊問記錄。在第9頁的第10行，這裡提到，對方用手抓住你的摩托車把手緊緊不放，硬是要強行挪動你的摩托車，於是你上前撥開他的手。所以你剛剛講的你先動手，是指這個動作嗎？
en-US	I’m going to show you the questioning statement in police station on the investigatory record 1 page 8. On the page 9 line10, you said the accuser grabbed your handlebar tightly. And he insist to move your motorcycle, so stepped forward to remove his hands. As what you mentioned, you said that you have the physical action first, do the mean the action is removing his hands?

en-US	Yes, that’s the statements I made in the police station after the incident happened.
zh-TW	對，這是在事件發生後我到警局作的筆錄。

zh-TW	在你撥開對方的手時，他有什麼反應嗎？
en-US	After you remove the other party’s hands, what was his interaction

en-US	He didn’t move. Instead, he grabbed the handlebars even more tightly.
zh-TW	他不但沒有把他的手移開，還更用力把我的把手抓得更緊。

zh-TW	所以對方不但沒有放開，還更加鉗握住機車把手，對嗎？
en-US	You mean that the accuser grabbed your handlebar tightly instead of removing his hand?

en-US	Yes.
zh-TW	是的。

zh-TW	接下來發生什麼事呢？
en-US	Then what happened next?

en-US	Because his body language told me he wouldn’t let go of my motorcycle, I ended up pushing his shoulder, hoping that he would loosen up the grab of the handlebars.
zh-TW	從他的肢體動作，可以看到他是完全沒有想放開我的摩托車，所以我推了他肩膀，希望他可以放開我的把手。

zh-TW	因為這樣子，你推了他的肩膀，是嗎？
en-US	So you pushed his shoulder because of this?

en-US	Yes, I pushed his shoulder.
zh-TW	是的，我推了他的肩膀

zh-TW	你覺得當時你有很用力嗎？
en-US	Did you push his shoulder with much force?

en-US	No, what I did was just a gentle push, like how we generally push others to do or not do something.
zh-TW	沒有，我只是輕輕推一下，就像我們平常要制止別人時推他的力道一

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)第48 頁之市立聯合醫院診療證明。在醫生的診斷證明中指出，告訴人身體與手臂兩個地方，有多處挫傷跟瘀青。請問這是怎麼造成的，是你剛剛的推嗎？
en-US	 I’m going to show the investigatory record 1 page 48. There is a medical report from the United Hospital. In the medical report, there were many hurts and bruises on the accuser’s body and arms. Is that caused by your pushing? 

en-US	I have no idea how those bruises or injuries occurred. I didn’t do that.
zh-TW	我不知道為什麼他身上會有那些挫傷和瘀青，我並沒有做。

zh-TW	有任何人可以證實你剛剛所陳述，當天晚上的事發狀況嗎？
en-US	If there anyone can be your witness of the content you state and what happened that day?

en-US	My girlfriend was home that evening. She knew I was going downstairs and she is also aware of the history between me and that neighbor. 
zh-TW	那天晚上，我女朋友在我家，他知道我下樓查看這件事，而且他也知道我和告訴人已經有很多次口角了。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你女朋友有看到那天的事件嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that your girlfriend is a witness of the incident?

en-US	She came down in the middle of the confrontation. She intended to film what’s going on with her cell phone, just in case we needed the clip to prove what happened.
zh-TW	我女朋友那時候也下樓，並且在我們爭執時想錄下影片，就是為了可以讓影片當成證據。

zh-TW	準確來講，你女朋友是在什麼時間到達現場，然後嘗試想要用手機拍下衝突發生的經過呢？
en-US	Certainly, when did your girlfriend arrive at the scene, and try to film what happened?

en-US	She arrived at the scene just when I was going to grab the handlebars for the first time.
zh-TW	她在我第一次想要奪回把手時抵達現場。

zh-TW	後來她有拍成功嗎？
en-US	So did she successfully film?

en-US	No, when she took out her cell phone, the plaintiff warned her not to do that. He had no right to tell her that.
zh-TW	沒有，正當我的女友要錄影時，告訴人警告她不准這麼做，但她並沒有權力制止我女朋友。

zh-TW	那我的問題先問到這裡。
en-US	Then my question ends here.

zh-TW	今天是初步的準備程序，下一次開庭前，你有希望法院為你調查的證據嗎？
en-US	Today is the preliminary preparatory procedure, before the next court, do you need any evidence that need the court to investigate?

en-US	Yes, I would like to request the court to look into the clips taken by the two CCTV cameras that day. 
zh-TW	 是，我想要求法院調閱那天兩台監視器的畫面。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你們社區巷口有監視器，希望我們能調閱錄影帶，是嗎？如果是的話，希望我們調閱哪一段區間呢，能否提供正確的時間？
en-US	Do you mean that there are CCTVs in the intersection of your community, so you want us to get those clips from it, right? If the answer is yes, can you provide certain time for us so we can request the clips more easily.

en-US	I came downstairs at around 7:40pm. Therefore, I would like the court to examine the clips from 7:30pm to 8:10pm.
zh-TW	我是在7:40分下樓的，我希望能調閱7:30到8:10的監視器畫面。

zh-TW	檢察官對於被告所要求查閱監視錄影帶一事，有何意見？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you want to add anything for the request from the accused of asking the CCTV clips?

zh-TW	沒有意見。
en-US	No.

zh-TW	今天的準備程序到此結束。下一次庭期訂為中華民國109年8月8日下午2點30分，當日會在庭檢閱本案件當中的監視錄影帶內容，並請雙方陳述意見。檢察官跟被告還有其他問題嗎？
en-US	Today’s court for preparatory procedure is dismissed. The date of the next court is set at 2:30 pm on August 8, 2020. On the next court, we will check the CCTV clips and ask the both parties more details on that day. Prosecutor and the accused, do you have anything to add?

zh-TW	沒有。
en-US	No, I rest.

en-US	No. 
zh-TW	沒有。

zh-TW	那今天開庭到此結束，請在簽完筆錄後離席，謝謝。

en-US	Yes I understand

en-US	Yes, I do.
zh-TW	我也了解

zh-TW	還有告訴人，你為什麼要離婚？
en-US	The expresser, why do you want divorce?

zh-TW	我和老公結婚3年了，但是年齡差距太大了，大約有30歲。以前我們談戀愛的時候，我不知道我們有很多價值觀不匹配，所以結婚後，我發現我一點也不幸福。我平時和老公溝通不好，而且他對一切都高度懷疑。他總是以關心的名義詢問我去了哪裡，遇見了誰。一開始我以為是他的關心，但隨著時間的推移，我覺得他越來越認真了。關於關心我。比如說，如果我告訴他我要去崇光百貨，但我帶著清風廣場的包回來後，他就會生氣，問很多關於我的事情。有時候，我不想解釋，但情況卻變得更糟。這種情況從我們結婚之初就開始了。我真的厭倦了這個。另外，我的丈夫是法國人，我的家人都不會說法語，所以我的家人都無法與他交談。雖然我不和家人住在一起，但每逢節假日或特殊場合，我們都會聚在一起。我病了好幾天，所以我媽媽來我家照顧我。由於語言障礙，我丈夫和我母親發生了很多衝突。我在他們之間做了很長一段時間的中間人，我覺得厭倦了，所以我想提出離婚。
en-US	I’ve been married for 3 years, but I want to divorce because the gap in age and we about 20 days. When we were in relationship, I didn’t find out  that our values are different. But after marriage, I didn’t feel happy. We didn’t have a great communication with each other for many times, and he is highly suspicious. He often ask me where I go to and who I’m with in the name of concern. At first, I though he just concern me, but he got more and more suspicious. For example, if I told him I will go to, went to Sogo at Shihlin, but i went back home with the shopping bag with breeze plaza, he will ask for me a lot of questions and got angry. Sometime, I didn’t want to explain, the situation gets worse. when I come home I carry merchandise of breeze plaza, then he will ask for many things and sometimes he get angry. Sometimes, I don’t wat to explain, and the situations gets worse. Such a situation begins when we got married, and I felt exhausted. Moreover, my husband is France; however, my parents cannot speak French, so they cannot also communicate with him. families don’t speak French. Therefore, they cannot communicate at all. Although I separate with my parents, we get together on holidays or special occasions. I was sick before, so my mom take care of me, and my mom have language barrier, so they have some conflicts between themselves. I felt tired to be the middleman so I want to divorce.

zh-TW	除了溝通和生活之外，您還有什麼理由支持您提出離婚？
en-US	In addition to communication, do you have any other reason you want to divorce?

zh-TW	這兩點是我離婚的主要原因。
en-US	These two problems are the reasons I want to get divorce.

zh-TW	被告你的回答者是什麼？
en-US	What’s the other party’s opinion?

en-US	I really like my wife, but I don't know why he wants to divorce. Don't the questions he just mentioned happen to every couple? They don't exactly want a divorce, do they?
zh-TW	我很愛我的妻子，但我不懂為甚麼他要訴求離婚。他剛才提到的問題不是全部的夫妻都會遇到的事情嗎？他們應該也不會想離婚吧？

zh-TW	當你的妻子談論生活形式時，你對生活形式有什麼看法？
en-US	Your wife mentioned the interaction, what’s your opinion?

en-US	I have to admit I had some fights with my mother-in-law because his mother decided to stay with us, but I didn't want her mother to live with us. I respect my mother-in-law, but I know that Chinese people value their parents very much. As for the other question my wife mentioned just now, I was just showing my concern for him. She is actually physically and mentally unhealthy. Two doctors have diagnosed him with mental illness and depression.
zh-TW	我承認我前陣子確實和岳母有一些爭執，但我們會吵是因為他想要跟我們待再一起，但我先前沒有預想到全部的人會住在一起。我尊重我的岳母是因為我知道中國人都很尊重家庭，也很孝順。至於我會想了解說我太太去哪裡，我只是單純的關心她。她身心不太好，他有精神疾病，也會去看精神科。

zh-TW	你的意思是說你的生活出現問題是因為你的妻子有精神疾病吧？
en-US	Do you mean the problem is your wife, is the mental and pysical oroblem, illness of your wife? 

en-US	I love her very much and I don't mind her illness, in fact I would love to take care of her. I even found the best doctor in the spiritual field for him, I just want the best care for him. Finding him the best doctor near us and I only hope for the best for her.
zh-TW	我很愛她，所以

zh-TW	你剛才提到他去看精神科，心理醫生對他、她的病是怎麼說的？
en-US	You just mentioned she has see the psychiatry, what is the doctor’s opinion?

en-US	The doctor said that he had been under great pressure for a long time, so she was easily angry. The doctor said he should go back to the clinic more often so that the psychiatrist can diagnose his condition.
zh-TW	醫生說因為他受到了許多壓力，所以很容易生氣。醫生建議可以近期來看診，所以也能控制他的病情。

zh-TW	你有孩子嗎？
en-US	Do you have children?

en-US	We don't have any small children.
zh-TW	沒有，我們並沒有小孩

zh-TW	一般來說，在正常的離婚案件中，在台灣人看來，我們希望勸說夫妻繼續在一起，而不是尋求離婚。雙方都想進行婚姻諮詢嗎？婚姻諮詢師的主要角色和職責是找出你婚姻中的問題。也許我們可以通過婚姻顧問來幫助您的婚姻。如果根本不工作，你已經盡力了，你會考慮嗎？
en-US	Generally Chinese or Taiwanese try to persuade couples to stay together in a relationship rather than seek a divorce in this kind of situation. Do both party consider for marriage consultant? The marriage counselor are responsiblele for find out the marital problems. Maybe the marriage counselor can help you maintain the marriage. If this didn;t work, at least you did your best.

zh-TW	我曾向丈夫建議過這種方法，但他沒有接受。他堅持認為婚姻是我們自己的事，我們沒有別人的幫助。既然他都這麼說了，我也無能為力。如果jhonor有能力說服他進行婚姻諮詢，我想嘗試一下。
en-US	I have suggest my husband for marriage counseling, but he didn’t take. He always insist that marriage is belong to couple, we don’t want ask other couple. Since he say no, I cannot force him. I hope the judge can suggest my husband to marriage counsel.

zh-TW	對此，被告您有何看法？
en-US	What do the other party think?

en-US	I don't mind if my wife wants a marriage counselor, but if we scold him for doing that, will my wife stop looking for her ex-boyfriend? That guy treated her badly, that guy was only interested in our money.
zh-TW	如果這是我太太的想法的話，那我不介意去進行婚姻諮商。但如果我們真的去進行婚姻諮商，我希望我的太太可以不要再去找前男友。那個難的不是真的愛他，他只是覬覦她或是我們的錢。

zh-TW	等等，你的意思是你妻子的婚姻有問題嗎？還有一個男朋友嗎？
en-US	Wait a minute, do you suspect she has a extra marital affair?

en-US	Yes, that guy was his ex-boyfriend, and he kept seeing his ex-boyfriend even after we got married.
zh-TW	沒錯，那個友人就是他的前男友，甚至在我們結婚了他們還是有見面。

zh-TW	您認為這種情況會導致您的婚姻出現問題嗎？
en-US	So do you think the exboyfrien is the reason why your marriage unhappy, why you are not happy in the marriage?

en-US	I wouldn't say it was the main reason for our marital problems, but I would think it did affect how we viewed each other. I hope my wife won't meet that guy anymore.
zh-TW	我不能說這是我們想離婚的主要原因，我只能說他的確影響到我們夫妻之間的關係，我只希望我老婆能她應我不要再見她前男友。

zh-TW	告訴人，您對此有何看法？
en-US	The expresser, what do you think?

zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說他對一切都持懷疑態度。他確實對一切都抱有很高的懷疑態度。他提到的男性朋友只是我最好的朋友之一。當一個人心情不好的時候，總是想和一些朋友聊聊，我也是。但我的丈夫總是把我和朋友的聊天當作家庭醜聞。他對我的朋友不友好。他不能，因為我有一個男性朋友然後認為我有婚外情。
en-US	This is why I mention my husband is highly suspicious of my ex boyfriend. He just mention that the male friend is just my good friend. When a person are in a bad mood, he or she would want to have a person to talk with, and I’m no acception. But my husband think that I talk with my friend is to show the family scandal. He treat my friends badly, but he cannot say that I have a extra marital affair with him.

zh-TW	我的意見是雙方都可以寫下自己對對方原來的看法。告訴人，你要知道，被告在國外有婚姻，在台灣，所以他可能為了你們的婚姻付出了很大的努力。你剛才說你和你丈夫的年齡差距很大，所以。你剛才提到你心情不好的時候總是和你的朋友聊天，我可以理解。這一部分我覺得你應該聽取意見，和你老公有個概念。
en-US	I suggest that both party can put down the stereotype. The expresser, you have to know that the other party leave his own country and come to here, so he may emphasize on this relationship, put more attention on this relationship. You mentioned that you have a gap in marriage, so you may know that when he has insecurity. I can understand that you wnat to talk with your friend when you are in a bad mood. However, you should get confirmation from your husband, or the situation will get worse. 

zh-TW	是的我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	被告，我知道你很愛你的妻子。但如果你愛一個人，就不要每天都懷疑她。就像她剛才說的，他出去的時候，你總是問他，問她很多問題，懷疑他有別的男朋友了。這種態度無法維持健康的婚姻。你必須明白，信任是婚姻的基礎。你必須明白它的重要性。
en-US	The other party, I know you still love your wife, but you cannot be high suspicious of him of her. He just mentioned that you may ask her many questions when she go out, and suspect of his male friends, so both of you cannot be happy in this marriage. You must know that confidence lay foundation of marriage. 

en-US	I get it, I'll give it a try.
zh-TW	我了解了，我會試著信任他。

zh-TW	看來雙方都不太願意進行婚姻諮詢，您將此案轉至婚姻諮詢中心看看我們是否能得到進一步的幫助。不得不提的是，因為你們都接受婚姻諮詢，所以你們必須一起去婚姻諮詢，否則這一切都是一句空話。我會給這個案例4個月左右的時間，看看你婚姻諮詢的效果。但我必須給你一個意見：婚姻根本不是一件容易的事。大家都知道，相聚容易，共處難。所以，如果你們已經結婚了，就繼續在一起吧。雙方都明白嗎？
en-US	Since both party are willing to have marriage counseling,  the case will transfer to the marriage counseling center, and see if they can solve this problem. Both the party accpet this method, so you have to go to marriage counsleing center together, otherwise the problem cannot be solved. And I will give this case for four months and see what’s the effect of marriage counsel. But I have to tell both party that marrigae is not easy, it’s not easy to maintain a marriage. Everyone knows taht it is easy to love each other, but it is hard to get along with each other. So since get marriage, you have to maintain this marriage. Do both party fully understand?

zh-TW	是的，我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I got it too, thanks.
zh-TW	我也理解，謝謝。

zh-TW	今天的法庭就到此結束。當準確的日期出來時，下一個法庭會通知您。
en-US	Then this preparatory procedure is dismissed here, and I will notify the both party if the court date are set.

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes I understand

en-US	Yes, I do.
zh-TW	我也明白

zh-TW	還有告訴人，你為什麼要離婚？
en-US	The expresser, why you want to ask for divorce?

zh-TW	我和老公結婚3年了，但是年齡差距太大了，大約有30歲。以前我們談戀愛的時候，我不知道我們有很多價值觀不匹配，所以結婚後，我發現我一點也不幸福。我平時和老公溝通不好，而且他對一切都高度懷疑。他總是以關心的名義詢問我去了哪裡，遇見了誰。一開始我以為是他的關心，但隨著時間的推移，我覺得他越來越認真了。關於關心我。比如說，如果我告訴他我要去崇光百貨，但我帶著清風廣場的包回來後，他就會生氣，問很多關於我的事情。有時候，我不想解釋，但情況卻變得更糟。這種情況從我們結婚之初就開始了。我真的厭倦了這個。另外，我的丈夫是法國人，我的家人都不會說法語，所以我的家人都無法與他交談。雖然我不和家人住在一起，但每逢節假日或特殊場合，我們都會聚在一起。我病了好幾天，所以我媽媽來我家照顧我。由於語言障礙，我丈夫和我母親發生了很多衝突。我在他們之間做了很長一段時間的中間人，我覺得厭倦了，所以我想提出離婚。
en-US	I’ve been married with my husband for 3 years, but the gap of ages is too big, it’s about30 years. When we were in a relationship I didn’t realize or opinion has such a big gap and after marriage I think I felt unhappy. In most of the time we cannot communicate well and my husband is highly suspicious of me. He often asked me about where I’m going and who I’m going to meet in the name of care, in the name of being care. At the Beginning, I believe he’s he really cares about me. But as time goes on, his behavior is getting more and more serious. For instance, if I told him I was going to Sogo in Shihlin District, but when I come home I carry merchandise of breeze plaza, then he will ask for many things and sometimes he get angry. Sometimes, I don’t wat to explain, and the situations gets worse. Such a situation happened as soon as we get married. I’m very tired of it. Futher, my husband is French, my families don’t speak French. Therefore, they cannot communicate at all. Although I live apart from my families, but the holidays or special occasions, we’ll have to meet each other. In the previous period, I’m a little weak and a little sick so my mother come to my home took care of me. Because language barriers, my husband had serious conflicts with my mother. I play the middleman between them, and I feel really tired of it. Therefore, I want to divorce him.

zh-TW	除了溝通和生活之外，您還有什麼理由支持您提出離婚？
en-US	Besides communication and being together, is there any other reasons that you want to divorce?

zh-TW	這兩點是我離婚的主要原因。
en-US	These two issues are the main reasons I want to divorce.

zh-TW	被告你的回答者是什麼？
en-US	The other party, what do you think about it?

en-US	I really like my wife, but I don't know why he wants to divorce. Don't the questions he just mentioned happen to every couple? They don't exactly want a divorce, do they?
zh-TW	我很愛我的妻子，我無法理解為甚麼他會覺得我們的婚姻有問題。他上述的問題不是每一對情侶都會遇到的問題嗎？他們沒有因此就想離婚，對吧？

zh-TW	當你的妻子談論生活形式時，你對生活形式有什麼看法？
en-US	However, focusing on the interaction problem your wife just mention, how do you think about it?

en-US	I have to admit I had some fights with my mother-in-law because his mother decided to stay with us, but I didn't want her mother to live with us. I respect my mother-in-law, but I know that Chinese people value their parents very much. As for the other question my wife mentioned just now, I was just showing my concern for him. She is actually physically and mentally unhealthy. Two doctors have diagnosed him with mental illness and depression.
zh-TW	我承認我前陣子和我的岳母有點衝突。原因只是因為他想跟我們住在一起，但是我還沒有習慣他在我們家。我很尊重我岳母，因為我知道家庭觀念對中國人是很重要的。至於，關於我太太剛才說的行蹤的問題，我只能說這就是我表達關心的方法。我太太的身心狀況其實沒有很好，他已經有因為憂鬱症及其他精神疾病去看過心理醫生了。

zh-TW	你的意思是說你的生活出現問題是因為你的妻子有精神疾病吧？
en-US	So you mean the problems of your marriage is a result from your wife’s mental and physical condition?

en-US	I love her very much and I don't mind her illness, in fact I would love to take care of her. I even found the best doctor in the spiritual field for him, I just want the best care for him. Finding him the best doctor near us and I only hope for the best for her.
zh-TW	我很愛她，我接受他的狀況，而且我也很想照顧她。我甚至在我們附近幫他找了最好的醫生，我只希望能把她照顧的最好。

zh-TW	你剛才提到他去看精神科，心理醫生對他、她的病是怎麼說的？
en-US	You mentioned that she has been to psychiatry, what does the doctor say?

en-US	The doctor said that he had been under great pressure for a long time, so she was easily angry. The doctor said he should go back to the clinic more often so that the psychiatrist can diagnose his condition.
zh-TW	醫生說他長期待在壓力的環境下，那就是為甚麼他很容易動怒。醫生有建議他定期回診，這樣比較好掌控他的情況。

zh-TW	你有孩子嗎？
en-US	Do you have children?

en-US	We don't have any small children.
zh-TW	我們沒有小孩。

zh-TW	一般來說，在正常的離婚案件中，在台灣人看來，我們希望勸說夫妻繼續在一起，而不是尋求離婚。雙方都想進行婚姻諮詢嗎？婚姻諮詢師的主要角色和職責是找出你婚姻中的問題。也許我們可以通過婚姻顧問來幫助您的婚姻。如果根本不工作，你已經盡力了，你會考慮嗎？
en-US	Well, generally, in the opinion of Chinese people and Taiwanese people, we always try to pursue couples to stay together in a relationship rather than seek a divorce.  Would the both parties consider a marriage counselor?I suggest so because the role and the drop of a marriage counselor is to help you communicate and getting along with each other. Perhaps you can get your marriage back by marriage counseling ing. Even if you failed, at least you had tried. Do you understand?

zh-TW	我曾向丈夫建議過這種方法，但他沒有接受。他堅持認為婚姻是我們自己的事，我們沒有別人的幫助。既然他都這麼說了，我也無能為力。如果jhonor有能力說服他進行婚姻諮詢，我想嘗試一下。
en-US	I once suggest so to my husband, but he didn’t agree. He always insist that marriage is our own business so we don’t want anyone to bother. Since he didn’t accept, I have nothing to do. But if the judge can pursue him to have a marriage counseling ing, of course I will accept.

zh-TW	對此，被告您有何看法？
en-US	The other party, what’s your opinion?

en-US	I don't mind if my wife wants a marriage counselor, but if we scold him for doing that, will my wife stop looking for her ex-boyfriend? That guy treated her badly, that guy was only interested in our money.
zh-TW	我不會介意去做婚姻諮商的，如果那就是我妻子希望。但是如果我們可以去做婚姻諮商，我希望他可以不要再去見她前男友。那個人不是真心想對她好，他只是對我們以及他的錢有興趣而已。

zh-TW	等等，你的意思是你妻子的婚姻有問題嗎？還有一個男朋友嗎？
en-US	Hold on, you mean your wife has other boyfriend?

en-US	Yes, that guy was his ex-boyfriend, and he kept seeing his ex-boyfriend even after we got married.
zh-TW	沒錯，那個就是他的前男友，甚至在我們結婚後他們也一直見面。

zh-TW	您認為這種情況會導致您的婚姻出現問題嗎？
en-US	So do you think it’s an important factor that caused the difficulties in your marriage?

en-US	I wouldn't say it was the main reason for our marital problems, but I would think it did affect how we viewed each other. I hope my wife won't meet that guy anymore.
zh-TW	我不會說這件事情造成我們婚姻的不快樂，他有一定的份量，至少他影響我們怎麼相處。我希望我的妻子可以向我保證他不會再見那個人。

zh-TW	告訴人，您對此有何看法？
en-US	The expresser, do you have anything to state about the issue?

zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說他對一切都持懷疑態度。他確實對一切都抱有很高的懷疑態度。他提到的男性朋友只是我最好的朋友之一。當一個人心情不好的時候，總是想和一些朋友聊聊，我也是。但我的丈夫總是把我和朋友的聊天當作家庭醜聞。他對我的朋友不友好。他不能，因為我有一個男性朋友然後認為我有婚外情。
en-US	This is why I say my husband is highly suspicious of me. The male friend he mentioned is simply a really good friend of me. If one is unhappy, he or she would want you to have a friend to talk about this, I’m no exception. However, my husband consider my talking to other people as I’m talking about the family scandal to others. He’s really unfriendly to my friends. However, he cannot consider me having an extra material affair simply because I’m meeting a male friend.

zh-TW	我的意見是雙方都可以寫下自己對對方原來的看法。告訴人，你要知道，被告在國外有婚姻，在台灣，所以他可能為了你們的婚姻付出了很大的努力。你剛才說你和你丈夫的年齡差距很大，所以。你剛才提到你心情不好的時候總是和你的朋友聊天，我可以理解。這一部分我覺得你應該聽取意見，和你老公有個概念。
en-US	My suggestion is can the both parties give up what you think about your partner for a while.The expresser, can you please understand the other party, your husband is a foreigner in this country, he has no family he is no friend. Therefore, he put all his time in this marriage in this in your relationship. As you mentioned, you are a old wife young wife. Therefore his sense of unsafe is understandable. You said that when you feel sad you need someone to talk about, to talk to, I can understand. However, should’t you get your husband’s understanding and consideration in this issue? Otherwise the misunderstanding will only expand.

zh-TW	是的我明白。
en-US	I get it.

zh-TW	被告，我知道你很愛你的妻子。但如果你愛一個人，就不要每天都懷疑她。就像她剛才說的，他出去的時候，你總是問他，問她很多問題，懷疑他有別的男朋友了。這種態度無法維持健康的婚姻。你必須明白，信任是婚姻的基礎。你必須明白它的重要性。
en-US	The other party, I know you love your wife every month still. However, if you really love someone, you shouldn’t be suspicious of her or him all the time. She said that whenever she goes out, you will ask a lot of questions, and you suspicious of having Alder boyfriend’s outside. How can such a situations such a condition remain your relationship? You should know that belief is the foundation of a marriage, please understand it.

en-US	I get it, I'll give it a try.
zh-TW	我明白了，我會試著做出改變的。

zh-TW	看來雙方都不太願意進行婚姻諮詢，您將此案轉至婚姻諮詢中心看看我們是否能得到進一步的幫助。不得不提的是，因為你們都接受婚姻諮詢，所以你們必須一起去婚姻諮詢，否則這一切都是一句空話。我會給這個案例4個月左右的時間，看看你婚姻諮詢的效果。但我必須給你一個意見：婚姻根本不是一件容易的事。大家都知道，相聚容易，共處難。所以，如果你們已經結婚了，就繼續在一起吧。雙方都明白嗎？
en-US	Since both parties agree on finding a marriage counselor, I will transfer this case to the marriage counseling center, perhaps they can help you keep this relationship. Please know that since the both party agree this temporary solution, you have to meet the marriage counselor together or this solution is simply a empty talk. And I will give for about 4 months to this case to see the result of your marriage counseling.  But I have to tell that both parties marriage is never an easy scene. Everyone knows it’s easy to fall in love but it’s difficult to last everyday. So since you’ve get marriage, please try to keep it. Can the both parties understand what I said?

zh-TW	是的，我明白。
en-US	Yes I do

en-US	I got it too, thanks.
zh-TW	我也明白了，謝謝。

en-US	I’ve been married to my husband for 3 years, but the gap in age is too large, that gap is about 30 years. When we have a relationship before, I did not know that we have a lot value that didn’t match with each other, so after I married, I found that I was not happy at all. I usually have a bad communication with my husband, besides, he is high suspicious about everything. He always use in the name of care to ask where I go and who I meet. At the beginning, I thought it was his care, but as time goes, I think he gets more and more serious. about caring me. For example, if I told him that I will going to Sogo department, but after I came back with the bag of breeze plaza, he will be angry and ask many things about me. Sometimes, I don’t want to explain it, but the situation becomes worse. Such situation begins at the beginning of our marriage. I’m really tired about this. Besides, my husband is French, neither of my family can speak French, so none of my family can have a conversation with him. Although I didn’t live with my families, but on the holidays or special occasions, we will gather together. I had sick for days so my mother come to my home took care of me. My husband had lots of conflicts with my mother because of language barrier. I have been the middleman between them for a long time, and I feel was tired of it, So I want to ask for a divorce.

zh-TW	除了溝通和生活之外，您還有什麼理由支持您提出離婚？
en-US	Besides the communication and life, do you have any reason that support you want to ask a divorce?

zh-TW	這兩點是我離婚的主要原因。
en-US	These two part are my main reason for the divorce.

zh-TW	被告你的回答者是什麼？
en-US	What’s your respondent?

en-US	I really like my wife, but I don't know why he wants to divorce. Don't the questions he just mentioned happen to every couple? They don't exactly want a divorce, do they?
zh-TW	我真的很喜歡我老婆，但我不知道為甚麼他要提起離婚。他剛剛所提的那些問題不是每對情侶都會發生的嗎？他們不全然想離婚，對吧？

zh-TW	當你的妻子談論生活形式時，你對生活形式有什麼看法？
en-US	As your wife talking, saying that life form, what’s your thought about the life form?

en-US	I have to admit I had some fights with my mother-in-law because his mother decided to stay with us, but I didn't want her mother to live with us. I respect my mother-in-law, but I know that Chinese people value their parents very much. As for the other question my wife mentioned just now, I was just showing my concern for him. She is actually physically and mentally unhealthy. Two doctors have diagnosed him with mental illness and depression.
zh-TW	我得要承認我有和我的岳母有一些爭吵，這是因為他母親決定要和我們待再一起，但我不想要她的母親和我們生活在一起。我尊重我岳母，但我知道中國人會很珍重自己的父母。至於剛剛另一個我老婆說到的問題，我只是在表現我對他的關心而已。她身心其實都不健康，有兩個醫生已經為他診斷了精神疾病跟憂鬱症

zh-TW	你的意思是說你的生活出現問題是因為你的妻子有精神疾病吧？
en-US	Do you mean that the reason why you have the problems on life is that your wife has mental illness, right? 

en-US	I love her very much and I don't mind her illness, in fact I would love to take care of her. I even found the best doctor in the spiritual field for him, I just want the best care for him. Finding him the best doctor near us and I only hope for the best for her.
zh-TW	我很愛她，而且我不介意她有的疾病，事實上我很想照顧她。我甚至為他找了精神領域最好的醫生，我只是想要讓他得到最好的照顧。在我們附近幫他找了最好的醫生，我只希望能把她照顧的最好。

zh-TW	你剛才提到他去看精神科，心理醫生對他、她的病是怎麼說的？
en-US	You just mentioned that he go to the psychiatry, whatdid the psychologist say about his, her illness?

en-US	The doctor said that he had been under great pressure for a long time, so she was easily angry. The doctor said he should go back to the clinic more often so that the psychiatrist can diagnose his condition.
zh-TW	醫生說他長期遭受龐大的壓力，所以說她很容易生氣。醫生說他應該要經常去回診，所以精神科醫生才能診斷他的病情。

zh-TW	你有孩子嗎？
en-US	Do you have any child?

en-US	We don't have any small children.
zh-TW	我們沒有任何小孩。

zh-TW	一般來說，在正常的離婚案件中，在台灣人看來，我們希望勸說夫妻繼續在一起，而不是尋求離婚。雙方都想進行婚姻諮詢嗎？婚姻諮詢師的主要角色和職責是找出你婚姻中的問題。也許我們可以通過婚姻顧問來幫助您的婚姻。如果根本不工作，你已經盡力了，你會考慮嗎？
en-US	Generally speaking, in the normal divorce case, in the opinion Taiwanese, we want to  persuade couples to stay together in a relationship rather than seek a divorce.  Do the both party want to have a marriage counseling? The main character and the responsibility of a  marriage counselor is to find out the problem in your marriage. Maybe we can help your marriage with the marriage counselor. If not work at all, you have tried your best, would you consider it?

zh-TW	我曾向丈夫建議過這種方法，但他沒有接受。他堅持認為婚姻是我們自己的事，我們沒有別人的幫助。既然他都這麼說了，我也無能為力。如果jhonor有能力說服他進行婚姻諮詢，我想嘗試一下。
en-US	I had suggest my husband with this kind of method, but he didn’t accept it. He insist that marriage is our own business, we didn’t have other’s help. Since he say so, i can not do anything. If the jhonor have the ability to persuade him to have a marriage counseling, i would like to try it.

zh-TW	對此，被告您有何看法？
en-US	And the respondent, what’s your opinion?

en-US	I don't mind if my wife wants a marriage counselor, but if we scold him for doing that, will my wife stop looking for her ex-boyfriend? That guy treated her badly, that guy was only interested in our money.
zh-TW	如果我老婆想要有個婚姻諮商的話我並不介意，然而如果我們罵樣做的話，可以請我的老婆不要再找他的前男友了嗎？那個男的對她並不好，那個男生只對我們的錢有興趣。

zh-TW	等等，你的意思是你妻子的婚姻有問題嗎？還有一個男朋友嗎？
en-US	Wait a minute, do you mean that your wife have marital problem? Have another boyfriend?

en-US	Yes, that guy was his ex-boyfriend, and he kept seeing his ex-boyfriend even after we got married.
zh-TW	沒錯，那個男生是他的前男友，就算我們結婚了，他還是持續跟他的前男友見面。

zh-TW	您認為這種情況會導致您的婚姻出現問題嗎？
en-US	Do you consider this situation that make your marital problem?

en-US	I wouldn't say it was the main reason for our marital problems, but I would think it did affect how we viewed each other. I hope my wife won't meet that guy anymore.
zh-TW	我不會說這是我們婚姻問題的主要原因，但是我會認為這件事情的確影響到我們面對彼此的看法。我希望我的我的老婆不會和那個人見面了。

zh-TW	告訴人，您對此有何看法？
en-US	The expresser, what’s your opinios toward this distinct?

zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說他對一切都持懷疑態度。他確實對一切都抱有很高的懷疑態度。他提到的男性朋友只是我最好的朋友之一。當一個人心情不好的時候，總是想和一些朋友聊聊，我也是。但我的丈夫總是把我和朋友的聊天當作家庭醜聞。他對我的朋友不友好。他不能，因為我有一個男性朋友然後認為我有婚外情。
en-US	This is why I said about he’s suspicious about everything. He really have high suspicious about everything. The male friend he had mentioned is just one of my best friend. When someone is in the bad mood,  they always want to have a talking with some friends, so do I. But my husband always take my talking with my friend as a family scandal. He is not friendly toward my friends. He cannot because i have a male friend then think i have an extra marital affair.

zh-TW	我的意見是雙方都可以寫下自己對對方原來的看法。告訴人，你要知道，被告在國外有婚姻，在台灣，所以他可能為了你們的婚姻付出了很大的努力。你剛才說你和你丈夫的年齡差距很大，所以。你剛才提到你心情不好的時候總是和你的朋友聊天，我可以理解。這一部分我覺得你應該聽取意見，和你老公有個概念。
en-US	My opinion is can both party put down your original opinion toward eachother. The expresser, you must know that the respondent  have a marriage in other country, in Taiwan, so he may put a lot of effort on your marriage. You just said that your gap in age between you and your husband is large, so. You just mention that you always have a talking with your friend when you are in a bad mood, I can understand it. In this part, I think you should receive the opinions and have a concept with your husband.

zh-TW	是的我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	被告，我知道你很愛你的妻子。但如果你愛一個人，就不要每天都懷疑她。就像她剛才說的，他出去的時候，你總是問他，問她很多問題，懷疑他有別的男朋友了。這種態度無法維持健康的婚姻。你必須明白，信任是婚姻的基礎。你必須明白它的重要性。
en-US	Respondent, I know you really love your wife. But if you love someone, do not be suspicious about her everyday. Just like she just said, when he went out, you always ask him, ask her a lot of problems, and suspicious him about having another boyfriend. This kind of attitude cannot maintain a healthy marriage. You must understand that trust is the basement of marriage. You must understand the important of it.

en-US	I get it, I'll give it a try.
zh-TW	我了解了，我會試著這麼做的。

zh-TW	看來雙方都不太願意進行婚姻諮詢，您將此案轉至婚姻諮詢中心看看我們是否能得到進一步的幫助。不得不提的是，因為你們都接受婚姻諮詢，所以你們必須一起去婚姻諮詢，否則這一切都是一句空話。我會給這個案例4個月左右的時間，看看你婚姻諮詢的效果。但我必須給你一個意見：婚姻根本不是一件容易的事。大家都知道，相聚容易，共處難。所以，如果你們已經結婚了，就繼續在一起吧。雙方都明白嗎？
en-US	It seems that both party are not, are willing to have a marriage counseling, you will transfer this case to the marriage counseling center to see if we can have the further help. You have to mention that because both of you accept the marriage counseling, so you have to go to the marriage counseling together, or all of this will be a empty talk. I will give this case for about 4 months to to see the effect of your marriage counseling.  But I have to give you an opinion is marriage is not easy at all. Everyone knows it’s easy to getting together but it’s difficult to live together. So if you had a marraige marriage, keep moving together. And the both party understand? 

zh-TW	是的，我明白。
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I got it too, thanks.
zh-TW	我也理解了，謝謝。

zh-TW	今天的法庭就到此結束。當準確的日期出來時，下一個法庭會通知您。

en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	Yes, I do.
zh-TW	我也知道

zh-TW	還有告訴人，你為什麼要離婚？
en-US	Expresser, why do you want to file for a divorce lawsuit?

zh-TW	我和老公結婚3年了，但是年齡差距太大了，大約有30歲。以前我們談戀愛的時候，我不知道我們有很多價值觀不匹配，所以結婚後，我發現我一點也不幸福。我平時和老公溝通不好，而且他對一切都高度懷疑。他總是以關心的名義詢問我去了哪裡，遇見了誰。一開始我以為是他的關心，但隨著時間的推移，我覺得他越來越認真了。關於關心我。比如說，如果我告訴他我要去崇光百貨，但我帶著清風廣場的包回來後，他就會生氣，問很多關於我的事情。有時候，我不想解釋，但情況卻變得更糟。這種情況從我們結婚之初就開始了。我真的厭倦了這個。另外，我的丈夫是法國人，我的家人都不會說法語，所以我的家人都無法與他交談。雖然我不和家人住在一起，但每逢節假日或特殊場合，我們都會聚在一起。我病了好幾天，所以我媽媽來我家照顧我。由於語言障礙，我丈夫和我母親發生了很多衝突。我在他們之間做了很長一段時間的中間人，我覺得厭倦了，所以我想提出離婚。
en-US	I’ve had a marriage with my husband for about three years; however, the gap of age of us is too huge, it’s 30 years old. When we were having a dating and a relationship, pur concept are matched; however, after marriage, I’m not happy. In many time, I have a difficulty talking to my husband. Also, my husband is highly suspicious to everything. He usually care about asking who I will meet and the place I will go in the name of caring about me. Firstly, i think he just care about me, but afterwe date, I think he got more and more serious about it. For example, if I said I want to go to sogo in Shihlin district; however, when I came back and the bag is not from sogo,instead, the bag is from breeze plaza, my husband will ask me everything then he will turn very angry. Sometimes, if I don’t want to explain, the situation will get worse. This situation happen just in the beginning in our marriage, I feel so tired, really tired. Moreover, my husband is a French; however, in my family, no one can speaking France. Currently, I live out of the family; however, on holidays or special occasions, I will live together with my family. Some days before, I’m a little sick, my mother came to my house to take care of me. However, because of the language barrier, my husband have conflicts with my mom. Being the middleman, I was so tired, so i want to file for a divorce.

zh-TW	除了溝通和生活之外，您還有什麼理由支持您提出離婚？
en-US	Besides negotaition and the patters you live together, what  are the other reasons for your divorce?

zh-TW	這兩點是我離婚的主要原因。
en-US	The two main problems are the mian factor that I want to file for a divorce.

zh-TW	被告你的回答者是什麼？
en-US	So what is the opinion of the respondant?

en-US	I really like my wife, but I don't know why he wants to divorce. Don't the questions he just mentioned happen to every couple? They don't exactly want a divorce, do they?
zh-TW	我真的很愛我的妻子，但是我不知道為甚麼他會覺得我們的婚姻有出狀況。就剛剛所提到的所有問題，是所有情侶，夫妻都會遇到的事情。但他們並沒有都想要離婚啊，不是嗎？

zh-TW	當你的妻子談論生活形式時，你對生活形式有什麼看法？
en-US	However,just look at, think about the procsee you live together, is there any problems? Think about that. 

en-US	I have to admit I had some fights with my mother-in-law because his mother decided to stay with us, but I didn't want her mother to live with us. I respect my mother-in-law, but I know that Chinese people value their parents very much. As for the other question my wife mentioned just now, I was just showing my concern for him. She is actually physically and mentally unhealthy. Two doctors have diagnosed him with mental illness and depression.
zh-TW	我承認這陣子真的是跟我的岳母有一些口角衝突。但是他執意要過來跟我們一起生活，我不知道他為甚麼要一直在家裡閒晃。我知道中華文化以家為重，所以我對我的岳母是尊重的。至於回應我妻子說關於我跟他的相處方式，我只想說這是我對他的表達關懷的方式。他身心狀況都不是很好，他有身理，精神科醫師來診斷他的精神疾病。

zh-TW	你的意思是說你的生活出現問題是因為你的妻子有精神疾病吧？
en-US	So you mean the reason for your problem is  because of the physical and mental llness,is it right?

en-US	I love her very much and I don't mind her illness, in fact I would love to take care of her. I even found the best doctor in the spiritual field for him, I just want the best care for him. Finding him the best doctor near us and I only hope for the best for her.

zh-TW	醫生說說他最近壓力太大所以很容易發怒。醫生是建議他定期回診才可以去治療她的狀況。

zh-TW	你有孩子嗎？
en-US	Do you have children?

en-US	We don't have any small children.
zh-TW	沒有，我們沒有小孩。

zh-TW	一般來說，在正常的離婚案件中，在台灣人看來，我們希望勸說夫妻繼續在一起，而不是尋求離婚。雙方都想進行婚姻諮詢嗎？婚姻諮詢師的主要角色和職責是找出你婚姻中的問題。也許我們可以通過婚姻顧問來幫助您的婚姻。如果根本不工作，你已經盡力了，你會考慮嗎？
en-US	Generally, in the cae of divorce, Chinese people always persuade couple to stay together than just seek for divorce. opinion of Chinese people and Taiwanese people, we always try to pursue couples to stay together in a relationship rather than seek a divorce.  Do the both party consider the marriage counselor, seeking a marriage counselor? Because the role of marriage counselor is to help you find the problems between your marriage. Maybe your marriage can be fixed by, via marriage counselor. If it doesn’t work, at least you tried. So, will you consider this? 

zh-TW	我曾向丈夫建議過這種方法，但他沒有接受。他堅持認為婚姻是我們自己的事，我們沒有別人的幫助。既然他都這麼說了，我也無能為力。如果jhonor有能力說服他進行婚姻諮詢，我想嘗試一下。
en-US	I asked my husband to do it before; however, he did not accept it. once suggest so to my husband, but he didn’t agree. He always insist that marriage is between us, we don;t need others to help, figure out our problems. Therefore, I cannot say anything. But if the honor, you can persuade my husband to accept it, I will take it into consideration.

zh-TW	對此，被告您有何看法？
en-US	So, the respondent, what’s your opinion? 

en-US	I don't mind if my wife wants a marriage counselor, but if we scold him for doing that, will my wife stop looking for her ex-boyfriend? That guy treated her badly, that guy was only interested in our money.
zh-TW	如果我的妻子他想要這樣做的話那我可以試試看。如果這樣做是有效的話，我希望我老婆不要再去找她前男友。那個男的真的很不行，他只是對他有興趣，或是對他，我們的錢有興趣。

zh-TW	等等，你的意思是你妻子的婚姻有問題嗎？還有一個男朋友嗎？
en-US	Wait a minute, do you mean that your wife have affair with other man?

en-US	Yes, that guy was his ex-boyfriend, and he kept seeing his ex-boyfriend even after we got married.
zh-TW	對，那人個就是他前男友，就算我們結婚了他們還是不停見面。

zh-TW	您認為這種情況會導致您的婚姻出現問題嗎？
en-US	Do you think this issue is the main problem, main factor that your marriage of problems?

en-US	I wouldn't say it was the main reason for our marital problems, but I would think it did affect how we viewed each other. I hope my wife won't meet that guy anymore.
zh-TW	不全然是因為他，但因為這件事情，我們相處上有一些狀況。我知希望我的妻子答應我不要再找他了。

zh-TW	告訴人，您對此有何看法？
en-US	Expresser, what do you think about this? Do you have anything want to say? 

zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說他對一切都持懷疑態度。他確實對一切都抱有很高的懷疑態度。他提到的男性朋友只是我最好的朋友之一。當一個人心情不好的時候，總是想和一些朋友聊聊，我也是。但我的丈夫總是把我和朋友的聊天當作家庭醜聞。他對我的朋友不友好。他不能，因為我有一個男性朋友然後認為我有婚外情。
en-US	This is why I mentioned he is highly suspicious of everything. The man he just mentioned is just my best friend, just BBF. When a person is sad, he or she would definitely wnat to vent his or her worry to others, I’m no exception. However, my husband just keep consider my venting to others as a family scandal. He always unfriendly to my friends, but he cannot just because of the sex, and treat me likethis, have a extra marital affair. 

zh-TW	我的意見是雙方都可以寫下自己對對方原來的看法。告訴人，你要知道，被告在國外有婚姻，在台灣，所以他可能為了你們的婚姻付出了很大的努力。你剛才說你和你丈夫的年齡差距很大，所以。你剛才提到你心情不好的時候總是和你的朋友聊天，我可以理解。這一部分我覺得你應該聽取意見，和你老公有個概念。
en-US	Take my suggestion, first, you have to throw away your ideas about others. The expresser, you have to know that the person like the repondantwho traveled abroad and take marriage that much, it is usual. As you mentioned, you have a huge gap, so his unsecurity is maybe make sense. I understand that you just said that said that you are upset, you want someine to vnet your problem. If you don’t tell your husband to let him understand your behavior, the problem will be bigger and bigger to fully understand.

zh-TW	是的我明白。
en-US	Yes, I do.

zh-TW	被告，我知道你很愛你的妻子。但如果你愛一個人，就不要每天都懷疑她。就像她剛才說的，他出去的時候，你總是問他，問她很多問題，懷疑他有別的男朋友了。這種態度無法維持健康的婚姻。你必須明白，信任是婚姻的基礎。你必須明白它的重要性。
en-US	Respondent, I cam exactly know your feelings that you love her, but you can;t just be highly suspicious of everything just because your love. Just like what she mentioned, when she want to go out, you just ask many many questions. Do your think this could make your marriage better? Isn’t it right? You have to know that marriage is based on trust between two parties. 

en-US	I get it, I'll give it a try.
zh-TW	我理解了，我會試試看。

zh-TW	看來雙方都不太願意進行婚姻諮詢，您將此案轉至婚姻諮詢中心看看我們是否能得到進一步的幫助。不得不提的是，因為你們都接受婚姻諮詢，所以你們必須一起去婚姻諮詢，否則這一切都是一句空話。我會給這個案例4個月左右的時間，看看你婚姻諮詢的效果。但我必須給你一個意見：婚姻根本不是一件容易的事。大家都知道，相聚容易，共處難。所以，如果你們已經結婚了，就繼續在一起吧。雙方都明白嗎？
en-US	Now that you can accept marriage counseling, so I will allow this case to the marriage counseling center. Maybe the marriage counselor can help you about this. But you have to know that this is a solution to your problem, but you have to go to the marriage couseling together. Otherwise, this will just be useless. I want you to go to marriage for 4 months, and after that, I will evaluate the solution. However, take my advise, marriage is not that easy. Everyone knows that falling in love with others is easy, but how to get along with others is difficult. Now you just married, just go to long, please. Do you really understand this?

zh-TW	是的，我明白。
en-US	Yes I do.

en-US	I got it too, thanks.
zh-TW	我也 知道了，謝謝。

zh-TW	今天的法庭就到此結束。當準確的日期出來時，下一個法庭會通知您。
