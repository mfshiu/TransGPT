zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The incident happened on May 22nd, 2014, and the defendant, Mr. Anderson, took the umbrella of Ms.陳小倩, and the incident happened in Yingge Ceramics Museum. This incident happened without asking for the permission from the plaintiff. When the defendant returned the umbrella, Ms.陳小倩, found that behavior right on the scene. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. In today’s procedure, we would like to understand the details on that day. Please explain regarding my questions to help the prosecutor what happened on that day. Do you understand? And later, we will ask the plaintiff about what happened on that day. Do you understand the procedure? 

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我明白。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	And first, the defendant, where were you at 4:15 in the afternoon on May 27th, 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen, on that day?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，我把傘放回傘架時，有看到陳小姐。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	 And what happened then on that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大叫，說我偷了她的雨傘。我想要告訴她，我只是拿到錯的傘。我並沒有想要偷她的傘，我想要解釋，但她根本不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did Ms. Chen think that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟同學一起去博物館看一個展覽。當我們看完展覽，有兩位同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定去外面買東西吃，也許是在外面找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，外面正在下雨。我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟同學借一把傘。因為我有點高，又有點壯，就決定跟我ㄧ個同學Adam借把傘。他的體型跟我差不多。所以我從傘架中拿了一把傘。我跟我的老師，還有幾位同學一起去買麵包。我們回來的時候，陳小姐就看到我，並對我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed was actually Adam’s? 

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我以為那把傘是亞當的，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	 Do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you took on that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得那把傘的顏色，是藍色的，而且不是全新的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the entire umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象中，是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone who prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，我出博物館的時候，我是跟老師還有兩位同學一起的。我的老師也有提議要借我的傘，因為她的傘有點小，我並沒有拿。我不想要她被淋濕，然後也有兩位同學在旁邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Therefore, perhaps, the professor and those two classmates can come to the court to verify what you said is true.

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	也許是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any other evidence that you would like to ask the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我想要把傘還給陳小姐，但她不想拿；我也試圖想要道歉，但她根本不聽。我的老師跟同學也許可以證實，我說的是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK. Now, I would like to ask Ms. Chen about the detail of the incident on that day.Ms. Chen, could you please elaborate what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day, and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. However, when I came out form the museum, I found that my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff in the museum to help me find the umbrella, but I later saw putting my umbrella back. When I found that the umbrella he took was actually mine, I was actually very angry, and I asked him why he had taken my umbrella. It was raining at that time. How could he do that?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What color was the umbrella you took on that day, and is there any feature of the umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took on that day should have been blue, dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please show page five on the file one. Is that the umbrella belonging to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this photo is common, and people can buy such an umbrella even at a 7-11. How could you verify that is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Actually, I did buy my umbrella at a 7-11. However, the button on my umbrella is a little broken; therefore, it is hard to buckle it up. In terms of this, I have especially talked about it when I made my record at the police station. And the umbrella, which the foreigner put back to the umbrella rack, also had this feature; therefore, it can be proven that the umbrella is mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant regrets and he is willing to apologize, would you like to forgive him? After all, what you missed was an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	It is not about what I missed was an umbrella. It is about one’s personality. If he had not taken the umbrella back on that day, I would be totally wet when I got home on that day. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	 Yes, I understand. And the court will subpoena those three witnesses to the court to testimony what happened on that day. The next court date is set on June 19th, 2014. Is that okay for you on that day, the defendant?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Ms. Chen, you can decide whether to come on the next court date. On the next court date, we will mainly ask the professor and the two fellows on that day. 

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	It doesn’t matter; otherwise, I have to take a leave from my job.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand, and today’s court is dismissed. And the two parties sign on today’s records, and you may leave.

en-US	The defendant Paul Anderson was accused of stealing the umbrella of Shiao Chien Chen in Yingge Ceramics Museum. This action wasn’t aware by the plaintiff. When you were about to return the umbrella, you were caught by Shiao Chien Chen with the umbrella. Therefore she decided to file this case. Today’s procedure is mainly set to figure out what happened on this day. Please answer my questions so that we can figure out what happened on this day. Do you understand? Later on, I will also question the plaintiff. Do both parties understand the procedure?

en-US	I have a question for the defendant. Where were you at 4:15pm on May 27th in 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	did you see the plaintiff Ms. Chen on that time?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	對，當我要把雨傘放回去的時候，陳小姐就在那

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對著我大吼，說我偷她雨傘。我試著跟他說我只是拿錯雨傘了，我根本沒偷她雨傘，我試著跟他道歉，但他不想聽我說。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	So why did Ms. Chen say you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	在當天我和一些同學到博物館裡面參觀一些展覽，當我們看完參展的物件之後，有個同學說他肚子餓，我們想說要找些東西吃，然後可能找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，我發現當時正在下雨。我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想說跟我ㄧ個同學借。因為我又高又壯，所以想說跟我ㄧ個叫亞當的同學借，他體型跟我比較相似。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，我和我的教授去買了一些麵包，和我的一些同學。當我們回來的時候，就是陳小姐對我大吼的時候。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed belonged to your classmate Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對我覺得那是我同學亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	do you remember what’s the shape and color of the umbrella you took on that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，印象中是藍色的，不是很新

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	so was the whole umbrella in blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	我印象中是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	can anyone verify what you just said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	對當時我走出博物館的時候，我的兩個同學還有老師都和我在一起。我老師甚至還想要借我雨傘，因為他的傘太小了所以我沒有跟他拿，我不想他被淋濕，還有其他兩位同學在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	These three people can manage to come to the court right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	do you have any further evidence that want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著想要把傘還給陳小姐，但他不願意；我試著要跟他到道歉，他也不接受。也許我的老師和同學可以證明我所言屬實。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	 Okay, now I’m going to inquire Mr. Chen what happened on that day. Ms. Chen, can you state what happened on that day?

en-US	When I went to the Yingge ceramics museum, it’s raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack. But when I got out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff in the museum to look for my umbrella for me but then I saw that foreigner put my umbrella back. When I found what’s on his hand was my umbrella I was so angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it’s raining outside? How could someone be so…

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	what’s the color of the umbrella you brought on that day? Did it have any feature on it?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	 The umbrella I brought that day was blue. I guess navy blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please show the investigatory record on page five. Is the umbrella on the picture yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	yes, it was this one.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	the umbrella on the picture was quite normal like the ones you can find in 7-11. How could you be sure that this one belongs to you?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, indeed. I bought this umbrella in 7-11. But my umbrella was broken a little bit at the place to close the umbrella. According to this point, I did explain to the police station about the button on the umbrella. The umbrella that the foreigner returned had the same characteristics as the one I had.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Will you consider to accept the defendant’s apology if he’s willing to apologize to you? After all, it’s only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	what do you mean “only” an umbrella? It’s something related to one’s basic ethics. If he didn’t return the umbrella on that day, he wants me to walk back in the pouring rain? I don’t want to accept his apology.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

en-US	Did you see plaintiff xiao qian Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	對，當我把傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐在那邊。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我大吼，然後說我偷了他的雨傘。我試著跟他解釋說，我一定是不小心拿錯的。我並沒有去偷他的傘，我嘗試跟他解釋，但他不肯聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	So why Miss Chen said you steal her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館參觀一個展覽。到我們結束參觀的時候，我的兩個同學說他們餓了。所以我們就到外面找食物吃，然後順便找找哪裡可以吃晚餐。當我在博物館裡的時候，我就發現外面正在下大雨了。因為我沒有帶傘，所以我就跟我同學借一把傘。因為我身形有點大，所以我決定從我朋友艾登那邊借了一支傘。他的身形跟我比較像。所以我就從傘架拿走一隻傘。然後我就去買一些麵包給我的教授和我的朋友。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我們大吼。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean that the umbrella you borrowed belong to your friend, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我那個時候是拿艾登的傘，我並沒有意圖想拿別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	So do you remember what kind of umbrella you took that day?the color and the shape?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我記得那個顏色，那個顏色是藍色的，而且整支傘看起來沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	如果我沒記錯的話，那應該整支都是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone proved what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	對，當我從博物館出來的時候，我的教授和我另外兩個同學可以幫我作證。我的教授甚至要借我他的雨傘。因為他的雨傘有點小，所以我沒有跟他借。我不想要讓他淋濕，況且其他兩個同學都在。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So all of them can come to the court and verified what you said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著嘗試跟陳小姐解釋說我沒有要偷傘，但是他不肯聽。我也試著跟他道歉但他就是不肯接收。或許我的教授和我兩個同學可以證實我講的話是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok now I am going to questioning Miss Chen what happened that day.Miss Chen, can you elaborate what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge ceramic museum that day.When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack.But when I came out, I found my umbrella was disappeared. I asked for the staffs in the museum to help me to find my umbrella.But when I came out the museum, I found a foreigner took my umbrella, and umbrella was in his hand. When I found that my umbrella was taken by that foreigner, I was very angry. So I yelled him, asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t him know that it was raining out there? How can……..

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Can you tell me what kind of umbrella you brought that day? Is there any feature?Like shape and color?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took that day was blue, deep blue one.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please see the investigate file, is that umbrella in the picture belongs to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	Actually,this kind of umbrella is quite common,you can be bought this kind of umbrella in many convenient stores like 7-11.How can you proved that it is belong to you?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought that umbrella in a 7-11. But there is a little problem on the button of the umbrella, so it can not be locked. At this point, when I filed the case to police,I have explain for them. The umbrella that foreigner put back have the same feature. So I pretty sure that it was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If defendant apologize,and want to reconcile…settle…..with him..

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it just an umbrella? It’s not only about an umbrella, it’s about…If him didn’t put back the umbrella, I may have to go back home without umbrella, and it’s raining. I don’t want to forgive hime.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Okay, I understand. So we will subpoena all of the three witness and defendant to the court.The next court will be on 3 pm, June nineteenth, 2014.All of the witness and defendant should have to come to the court. Do you understand, defendant?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是，我會準時到場。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, the next court, you may come or not to come to the court.Basically we are going to questioning the witness, which are his classmate, and his professor.So you may choose to come or not to come.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。

en-US	I went to Yinge ceramics museum that day, and it was raining. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack out there. When I came out, my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff of the museum to find the umbrella for me, and then I found out that the foreigner took my umbrella.

en-US	Indeed, I bought that umbrella at 7-11. But the button of my umbrella was a little bit broken, so it couldn’t be buckled up. I explained this to the police when I called them. The one the foreigner put back had the same situation, from this, I could tell that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If he is regretful and willing to apologize, is it possible that you could forgive him? After all, it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by “just an umbrella?” it’s about a person’s virtue. If he didn’t take back that day, didn’t I have to go home in the rain? I don’t want to forgive him.

en-US	 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and it was raining. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella into the umbrella rack. When I was out, I noticed that my umbrella was gone. I ask the museum to help me find my umbrella then I saw the foreigner put my umbrella back. It was the umbrella I lost. I was so angry that I ask him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he notice that was raining outside? Why he was so lack of morality?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Can you tell me what color you brought that day? Any specific charateristics?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought was blue, deep blue, I think.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	The evidence one, picture on page five. Is that your umbrella in the picture?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	 The umbrella in the picture is common in 7-11. Why can you sure that was your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought my umbrella at 7-11. But there is some broke at the button so that I can recognize that was my umbrella. Also I told the police as the explanation. The umbrella which the foreigner put back had the same feature so I was sure that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So can you tell me if he is regret and willing to apologize, is there any possible to forgive him? Because it is just an umbrella?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	 What do you mean “it is just an umbrella?” It is about morality issue. If he didn’t put back the umbrella, should I have to get wet home? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	 Okay, I understand. We will subpoena to the three people that defendant just mentioned to clarify what defendant said is true or not. The next court date will be set at 3 PM, June 19th, 2014. Defendant and the other three people should show up. Defendant, is that fine with you?

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	 Plaintiff, Miss Chen, you don’t have to come to the next court. Basically, we will ask some questions to defendant’s classmates and professor. If you want to come, it is welcome.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No. I don’t want to take a one day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	Paul Anderson, on May 27th 2014, when you went to Ying ge Ceramics Museum, you took Miss Chen’s umbrella. The situation is that you didn’t tell the plaintiff, and when you give back the umbrella, Miss Chen found out that you stole her umbrella. Then she sued you of stealing. Today’s purpose is to understand the details of that day. Please answer my question to help the police to understand the situation. Later, I will ask the plaintiff, Miss Chen, some details of that day. Do both parties understand the procedure? 

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, at 4:15 p.m. on May 27th 2014, where was you?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see Miss Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有阿，當我把傘放回傘價的時候。她就在那了。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我大叫說我偷了他的傘。我試著要告訴他我拿錯把了，我沒有偷他的傘。可是他根本不聽我說。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why Miss Chen still insist that you steal her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟我跟我同學去博物館看展覽。當我們看完的時候，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定去外面找地方吃東西。可是當我們要離開的時候，外面在下雨。我沒有帶傘，所以想跟我同學借把傘。但是我很高又很壯，我決定跟我朋友亞當借傘。她的身形跟我很像。所以我從傘架上拿了他的傘。我跟教授一起去買一些麵包。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大吼大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed on that day is Adan’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對阿，那把傘是亞當的。我根本沒有想要偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember the umbrella’s color and type?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，是藍色的而且不是很新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我認知裡面，它是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone can prove that you are innocent?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有阿，當我到博物館時，我的兩個同學跟教授都跟我在一起。我教授甚至要借我他的傘，但是因為它的傘太小了，我就沒拿了。我不想要教授淋濕。我其他兩個同學也在那。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Can all of your friends arrive the court to prove what you just said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	應該是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著想要把傘環給陳小姐。可是他不接受，我想跟他道歉，它也不聽。我的兩個朋友跟教授可以證明我說的話是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Now I am going to ask Miss Chen some details of that day. Miss Chen, can you deliberate what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	when I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum, it was raining. I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack when I went into the museum. After I went out of the museum, I found out that my umbrella disappeared. I ask the staff of the museum to find my umbrella, and then I saw the foreigner gave the umbrella back to the rack. I was so angry and I ask him why he took my umbrella? Didn’t you know there is raining outside?............

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What’s the color of the umbrella which you brought at that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took that day is blue. It’s dark blue.

en-US	The umbrella on that picture is common which you can buy in any convenient store. How can you make sure that it is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	I bought the umbrella in convenient store. But the button on the umbrella is broken, and it can’t buckle up. I have told the detail to the police when I sue the case. The umbrella the foreigner gave back has the same character. It is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	null

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it is just an umbrella? …………………………………. If he didn’t give back the umbrella to me, did he want me to go home when it’s raining?

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	那天，我和一些同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看一個展覽。我們看完展後，兩個同學說他們肚子很餓。所以我們決定出去走走並且吃飯，再找找可以吃晚餐的地方。當我要離開博物館時，我發現在下雨了。我沒有帶傘所以我想要和我同學借傘。因為我比較高也比較壯，所以我決定要和我的同學艾登借傘，因為他的體型和我比較類似。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，然後和我的教授和同學去買麵包。當我們回來的時候，陳小姐就對著我們大喊了。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?

zh-TW	有啊，當我回到博物館時，我的教授和同學都跟我在一起，我的教授甚至提議說要借她的雨傘給我，但是因為她的傘比較小，所以我就沒有跟她借，我不想讓她淋濕，而另外兩個同學也是一樣的情況。

en-US	Can I ask you a question? If the plaintiff is regretful and he really wants to apologize to you, can you accept his apologize, after all, this is just an umbrella?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The defendant, Paul Anderson, took Xiaoqian Chen’s umbrella in Yingge Ceramics Museum on May 27th, 2014. This behavior happened in the condition that the defendant didn’t tell to the plaintiff. When the defendant wanted to return the umbrella, Xiaoqian Chen found the defendant and found he is guilty. Therefore the plaintiff accused the defendant. The purpose of today’s procedure is to understand what happened on that day. Please answer the question the help the prosecutor to understand what happened on that day. Do you understand? Later, I will ask the plaintiff to explain what happened on that day. Do both parties understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	Me, too

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	The defendant, where were you at 4:15 pm, May 27th in 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	當時我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Miss Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有。當我把傘放回傘架的時候陳小姐就在那邊了。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我狂吼，說我偷了她的雨傘。我嘗試告訴她我不小心拿錯了，我並沒有偷她的雨傘。我嘗試向她道歉但她都不理我，她都不想聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why Miss Chen said you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟幾個同學去那邊看展覽。當我們參觀完以後我兩個同學說他們肚子餓了， 因此我們就決定出去找一些食物或者找晚餐的地點。 當我離開博物館的時候我發現正在下雨。 我沒有帶雨傘，所以我打算向同學借傘。 因為我有點高壯所以我想向我的同學Adam借雨傘，他的身形跟我差不多，所以我就從傘架拿一把傘。 我嘗試去買一些麵包給我的教授和我的朋友。 當我回來時就正是陳小姐對我吼叫的時候。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You said that the umbrella you borrowed is belonged to Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我想我借的就是亞當的。而且我沒有偷任何傘的意圖。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella which you borrowed on that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色。 它是藍色的，而且不是很新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is that the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	根據我的印象，顏色是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Who can prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	當然。 當我離開博物館的時候我的教授和我兩個同學都跟著我。 我的教授甚至想借我她的雨傘，但我教授的雨傘很小所以我就沒有拿了。 我不想讓我的教授和其他兩位同學被雨淋濕。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So your classmates and professor can come to the court to prove what you said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是的。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you need other evidence which the prosecutor can help for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我嘗試要把陳小姐的傘還她，但她不收。 我試著跟她道歉，但她完全不想接受。 也許我的教授跟我的同學可以證實我今天所說的話。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, now I want to ask Miss Chen what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you tell the details what happened on that day to us?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	It was raining and I went to The Yingge Ceramics Museum. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. After I left the museum， I found my umbrella was missing. I asked the staff of the museum to help me find my umbrella but the foreigner just came back and returned my umbrella. When I found he took my umbrella, I was so angry and asking him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? Who can do such a thing like that?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What the color and the shape of your umbrella which you took on that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	I took a blue umbrella, is deep blue on that day.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the picture of the, page five. Is that the umbrella belonged to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it was my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is a kind of common umbrella which can be bought easily in convenient store. How can you be sure that this umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought my umbrella in the convenient store. However, the button of my umbrella was broken. I can’t close my umbrella. When I tell the police, I mentioned this point to them. The umbrella which was returned by the foreigner has the same feature so I’m sure that he took my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	I want to ask you a question. If the defendant regrets and he wants to apologize to you can you forgive him and reach a settlement with him because it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? This is about the basic moral of people. If he didn’t return my umbrella, maybe I needed to walk in the rain to home. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	The court will subpoena three people who the defendant mentioned: the professor and his two classmates to explain what happened on that day. The court will be set at 3pm on June 19th 2014. The defendant and three witnesses need to come to the court. The defendant are you ok on that time?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	沒問題我可以到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The plaintiff, Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not. Basically we will ask the professor and the classmates of the defendant. If you want to come to the court, that is ok.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, it’s not necessary because I need to have a day off if I come to the court.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	Ok, I understand. So the court ends here. Please leave the court after the both parties sign the record.

en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我大聲吼，說我偷他的傘，我試著跟他說我拿錯傘了，我試著跟他道歉，但她不願意接受。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	 Why did she say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining.

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天，我和我同學來這邊看一個展覽，當看完這個展覽之後，有兩同學說他們很餓，所以我們就一起出去買點吃的，然後找個地方吃晚餐，當我要準備離開博物館的時候，發現外面在下雨，因為我沒有帶傘，所以想跟其中一個同學借一把傘。因為我人高又魁，所以想跟其中一個叫亞當的同學借傘，我跟他體型比較像。所以就從傘架中拿了一把傘。我買一些麵包給同學和教授，當我回來的時候，就看到陳小姐對我大聲怒喊著。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you that the umbrella you borrow is belong to your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Can you tell what’s color and shape you took at that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	The umbrella is whole blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	我印象中好像是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Could anyone prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	當出來的時候，我和我教授還有同學一同出來，我教授甚至願意借我傘，但他的傘實在太小，所以我沒跟他借，我不想教授因為我而淋雨，當時我有兩個同學在那。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, the three persons you just mention could prove what you said is true, is that right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence you want the police investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著把這把傘還給他，但是他不願意。此外，我想道歉，但他也不願意接受。我想我同學和教授都可以證明我說所說的都是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK, Ms. Chen, let me ask you what happened at that day?Ms.Chen , could you explain what happened at that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and it was raining at that day. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. When I leave out, I found my umbrella was gone. I ask people in museum to look for my umbrella and later I found this foreigner took my umbrella. I was angry and asked him why did he take my umbrella. It was raining at that day.

en-US	Actually, the blue umbrella you claim belongs to you is easy to buy in convenience store, how could you say that this umbrella belongs to you

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, my umbrella was bought in convenience store. The lock part of mu umbrella is little broken. I could not lock it up. I report this point when I reported to police. The umbrella which the foreigner took has the same specifics sot that I could say that the umbrella is mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	 Is it possible that you forgive the defendant? After all, he has the sense of regret.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it was just an umbrella? I think it should be public norm. If he did not return the umbrella to me, I have to come home with big rain? I do not want to forgive him.

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	事發當天我和一些同學去看展覽。當我們看完展覽的時候，我有幾個同學說他們肚子餓。因此我們決定走出博物館找些東西吃，甚至是吃晚餐。當我要離開的時候，發現正在下雨。我忘記帶傘了，所以想要和我同學借。因為我長得比較高大，所以我想要跟亞當，我的同學，借傘，他的體型和我比較相近，所以我就從傘架拿了一支傘。我就和我的老師和同學一起去買麵包了。當我們回來的時候就是事發的經過了，陳小姐就開始對我大喊。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You said that the umbrella you took at that time belonged to your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	 對，我以為我當時拿的傘是我同學的，所以我並沒有偷傘的意思。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember what the shape is the umbrella and what color is?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得它是藍色的，而且不是很新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶中，應該是藍色的吧。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anybody can prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	 是的，當我走出博物館的時候，我和老師和同學在一起，我的老師甚至提議要借我傘。但她的傘比較小，所以我並沒有跟她借，因為不想要老師淋溼，然後還有其他兩個同學在，所以就跟別人借。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Can those three people come to the court as a witness to help you?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試圖把傘還她但她不接受，我也試圖跟她道歉，但她一樣不接受。可能我的老師跟同學可以證明我今天所說的都是實話吧。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	 I’m going to ask some questions to the plaintiff, Ms. Cheng. Ms. Cheng, can you describe what happened at that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went to the Yingge Museum and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack at the front door. When I was going to leave, I found out that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff to help me find my umbrella. And at that time, I saw this foreigner came back and put back my umbrella. When I found out that the umbrella he took was mine, I angrily asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining? How could he do that?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What was the color of the umbrella which you brought that day? Is there any feature?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day was blue. Specifically, dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the picture 5 in document 1. Is the umbrella in this picture your umbrella?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is quite plain. It’s just a normal umbrella that you can buy in a convenient store. How can you confirm this umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I just bought it in 7-11. However, my umbrella has a broken park, so I can recognize it. I have explained that to the police when I filed this case at the police station. The umbrella this foreigner put back shared the same feature, so I can say that it is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant regrets for his behavior and has the will to apologize, would you accept that? After all, the thing you lost is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	How could you say that it’s just an umbrella? It’s about the moral issue. If he didn’t put back, maybe I had went(gone) home in the heavy room. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	 I understand. We will subpoena those three people the defendant mentioned to the court as witnesses. Next court will be set at 3p.m., on June 19th, 2014. And the defendant and three of the witnesses should show up. Is this time okay for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會出席。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Plaintiff, the next court you may show up or not. Depends on you. Basically, we will ask some questions to the defendant and the witnesses, so if you wouldn’t show up is okay.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No I won’t come. I need to ask for a day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. Then, today’s court is adjourned. Please sign the document and you may leave.

en-US	Indeed, my umbrella was bought from the 7-11, but the bottom of my umbrella is a little bit broken, out of order, it didn’t work very well, for this point, I’ve already told and explained to the police when I reported the case. The umbrella that the foreigner took and returned had the same problem on the umbrella, so I believe that’s my umbrella. 

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	May I ask you if the other party, the defendant, want to apologize and is very sorry about this, would you consider to forgive him? Since the thing you lost is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by only just an umbrella? It’s the issue about morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, what do you want me to do? Did I need to run in the rain and go home? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand, then we will subpoena the three people the defendant had mentioned and ask them to come to the court and ask them to verify for the case. The next court will be set on 6/19/2014, at 3 p.m., is that okay with you? And in addition, the three witness have to come as well.

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	好的我會到

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not to come for the next court. Basically, we will question the professor and the classmates of the defendant, if you want to come, it’s still ok.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I don’t want to come, if I have to come, I need to take a day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The case happened on twenty seventh, May, 2014. The defendant visited the Yingge Ceramics Museum and stole the plaintiff’s umbrella.This incident happens without informing the plaintiff.When the defendant tried to steal the umbrella, the plaintiff caught the defendant on the scene.Therefore, she filed the case against the defendant.Today we mainly want to find out what happened on that day.Please answer my question and try to explain so the prosecutor would know the whole scene. Later, I will also ask the plaintiff about what happened on that day. Do both parties understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand, too.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, where were you on twenty seventh, May, 2014 at 4:15 p.m.?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time, did you see the plaintiff, Miss Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是，當我要把傘放回傘架時，我就看到她

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大叫，說我偷了她的傘 我試著告訴她，我應該是拿錯了傘 我並沒有偷她的傘，我試著向她解釋，但是她都根本都不聽

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Then, why Miss Chen would say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	當天我和同學一起去博物館看展覽 我們看完展覽後，我的兩位同學說肚子餓了 因此我們決定出去買點東西來吃，或找個地方吃晚餐 就當我要離開博物館的時候，我看到外面在下雨 我當時沒有帶傘，所以我本來打算和我同學借一把 因為我人比較高大，所以我想要向我的朋友借一把傘，他的名字叫做亞當他的身型和我差不多 所以我就從傘架裡拿了一把傘 然後我就和我的教授和一些朋友去買麵包當我回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大喊

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	 Do you mean that the umbrella you took from the umbrella rack is the umbrella of your friend, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	 對，我當時就以為那把傘是我朋友亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you still remember the color and the shape of the umbrella you took?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色是藍色，但看起來並不新

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella all in blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶中，它是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anybody can prove what you say is true?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有，當我從博物館出來的時候，我的教授和我的兩個同學在我身邊 我的教授甚至想要借我她的傘 但是她的傘太小了，所以我並沒有跟她借傘 我並不想要害我的教授淋溼，所以我也沒有跟另外兩位同學借傘

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	 Do those three people can come to the court can prove your innocence, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想應該可以吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	 我有試著想要把雨傘還給陳小姐，但是她不肯接受，我也試著向她道歉，可是她也不願意接受 或許我的教授和我的兩個同學可以證實我今天的所言不假

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Now, I am going to ask Miss Chen about what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you briefly describe what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day. At that time, it was raining.When I entered the museum, I left my umbrella outside the museum.However, when I came out the museum, I found my umbrella missing.I asked the staff of Yingge Ceramics Museum for helping to find my umbrella. At that time, we found this foreigner taking my umbrella.When I found out that my umbrella was on his hand, I was very angry and I asked him why you stole my umbrella?Don’t you know that it is raining? It is really an impolite behavior.

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What is the color of the umbrella that you took on that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The color of the umbrella is blue, kind of deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please see the investigatory file number one on the fifth page. Is this umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on the investigatory file is quite a common type of umbrellas which everybody can buy it on 7-11. How you can say that it is the umbrella that is of yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	That’s true. That’s the umbrella I bought from 7-11.However, there is a problem on the button of my umbrella so it is hard to fold it.When I filed the case against him in the police office, I did mention this point.The umbrella that this foreigner put back into the umbrella rack is also with this special point so I regarded it was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the other party does have the wiliness to settle this case and apologize, are you willing to accept his apology and settle the case? After all, it is an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it is just an umbrella? It is about does a person have morality or not.On that day, if he didn’t come back and put back the umbrella, I would go home in all wet.I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand.Then the court will subpoena those three people mentioned by the defendant to the court and to make some explanations.The next court date is set by nineteenth, June, 2014, at three p.m. On that day, the defendant and those three witnesses show up.

en-US	Miss Chen, you don’t have to be here on the next court date.Basically, on that day, we will ask some questions to his professor and fellow classmates. If you want to come, it is Okay.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I won’t be here because I have to ask a day-off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我喊叫，說我偷他雨傘。我試著跟他說我一定是拿錯傘了，我沒有偷他的傘。我想要道歉，可是她都不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	當天我跟一些同學去看展覽。看完展覽之後，我有兩個同學說肚子餓了。我們想要出來吃點東西，就是晚餐吧。我要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了。我沒有帶傘所以我想跟同學借一把。因為我人有點高大，所以我原本想跟亞當借傘。他的身形跟我比較像。所以我就從傘架拿一把傘，我跟教授跟朋友去買一些麵包。我回來，陳小姐就對我喊叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you used were adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我當時以為是亞當的，我並沒有想偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	我現在回想起來，是藍色沒錯

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone who can prove your statement?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有，當我走出博物館的時候，我的教授和兩位朋友和我在一起。我教授甚至說要借我他的傘。因為他的傘有點小，所以我就沒有接受。我不想他的衣服濕掉，所以…

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So probably we can have three of them as a witness in the court. Right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想可以吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

en-US	I went to the Ying-ge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. As I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. However, when I was about to leave the museum, I found the umbrella disappeared. I asked the staff find the umbrella for me. Then I saw this foreigner who is carrying my umbrella. When I found that the umbrella that he was taking was mine, I was furious. Didn’t he know that it was raining. He didn’t have any empathy.

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Was there anything special on your umbrella? I mean, is there any marks?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella was blue, specificly dark blue.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	This kind of umbrella can be bought in convenience stores, such as 7-11. How can you make sure that this umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought the umbrella at 7-11. And there’s some damage on the opening part. When I was at the police station, I told th police this point. And the umbrella also had the same trait. So I could say that that umbrella was actually mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So will you forgive him if he’s really regretful. I mean the incident is all an umbrella, which is not a big deal.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean not a big deal? It’s about empathy. If he hadnt returned the umbrella, I must have been wet and walked all the way home. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The time was 5/27 2013. In that time, the defendant took plaintiff’s umbrella in Yingge Ceramics Museum. The plaintiff was unknown with this case. When the defendant took the umbrella back, the plaintiff found what he did. So the plaintiff filed this case. Today’s procedure mainly understand what happened in that day. You have to answer my questions to make the prosecutor understand what happened in that day, do you understand? And I will ask the plaintiff what happened in that day. Do both parties understand this procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解了。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, at 4:15 PM on 5/27 2014, where were you in that day?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時正在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Hsio Chien Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，當我把傘還回傘架的時候，我有看到她。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened in that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她叫說我偷了她的傘。我試圖告訴她我只是拿錯了傘。我並沒有偷她的傘，我試圖向她道歉，但她還是大叫。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why would Hsio Chien Chen say that you steal her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和同學們去博物館參觀展覽，當我們結束參觀展覽之後我有兩個同學說他們餓了。於是我們決定出去找東西吃，那大概是在晚餐的時間。當我們正要離開的時候，我們發現外面正在下雨。我並沒有帶傘，所以我打算和我的同學借傘。因為我人比較高大，所以我決定跟我的同學借一把比較大的傘。因為他的體型跟我比較像。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘，我和一些教授還有我的同學同行。當我回去時，陳小姐就對著我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean that the umbrella that you took is your friend, Adam’s? 

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	沒錯，我那時候就想說，那把傘是亞當的。我並沒有打算要偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color and shape that umbrella you took?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得那把傘是藍色的，但不是一把新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	So is only one color blue for the umbrella?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	就我所知，那把傘是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Do anyone can verify what you state?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	當然阿，我身邊有一些教授和兩位朋友。我的教授甚至跟我說，要借我一把傘。但是她的傘太小了，不適合我。我不想要她淋濕，我的另外兩外同學也在旁邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three people can make it to verify this situation for you, is that right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do any other … you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著還陳小姐傘，但她不想理我。我試著向她道歉，但她也不想理我。也許我的教授和我的朋友可以證實我今天所說的話。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Now, I am going to ask Ms. Chen what happened in that day. Ms. Chen, could you say what happened in that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	The day I went to Ying ge Ceramics Museum, it was a raining day. When I entered in the Museum, I put my umbrella in my umbrella rack. When I went out, I cannot find my umbrella. I asked the Museum’s officer to help me to look for the umbrella, and I found that the defendant out back my umbrella. When I found that he took my umbrella back, I was angry. And I asked him why he took my umbrella away. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How could he do that? So what’s the color of the umbrella you took in that day?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	And is any characteristic of that umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella that I took in that day is blue. Perhaps it’s deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now, we are going to show you investigatory file of page5. The umbrella in the photo is yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it’s mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the photo is a very common type. Anyone can buy it in the convenient store of 7-11. How could you know it was your umbrella? 

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought it in 7-11. However, my umbrella’s button was broken, so the button cannot be used. For this point, I explained it when I told to the police. The umbrella that he put back meets this characteristic, so I think it’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So would you forgive the defendant if he wants to regret and apologize for you?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	How can you say that? It’s about the basic moral. If he didn’t put the umbrella back, …. I wouldn’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. We will subpoena three of witness in that day, and we will try to ask them what happened in that day. Defendant, the next court date will set at3:00 P.M. in June 19 2014, and three of witness and you should make it, is that ok with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Plaintiff, Ms. Chen, you can make it if you want. We will manly ask the defendant’s classmates and professors, you can make it or not.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I wouldn’t make it.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. The court will dismiss here. Please sign the statement and leave the court.

zh-TW	今為偷竊案件偵字1425號偵查程序

zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Miss Chen, at that time?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有，當我正要把雨傘放回傘架的時候，陳小倩她有在現場。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大吼大叫說:「我她了她的雨傘。」我試著告訴他我是拿錯雨傘，我沒有偷她的雨傘，我有試著跟她解釋，但是她一點都不想聽我的解釋。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Can you explain why Ms. Chen stated that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining.

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和我的同學去博物館看一場展覽。當我們看完展覽的時候，我的兩個同學說他們很餓，所以我們決定離開，去看看有沒有甚麼東西可以吃，所以我們就離開去找餐廳。當我離開博物館時，我發現下雨，我沒有帶傘，所以我打算跟我的同學借一把。因為我的體格比較高，所以我決定跟我的朋友Adam借傘。他和我的體格相近。然後我就雨傘架拿了一把雨傘。然後我打算去買一些麵包給我的教授和朋。當我們回來時，陳小姐看到我就對我大吼大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You are saying that the umbrella you borrowed was your classmate’s,Adam’s, umbrella?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我以為我拿的傘就是亞當的雨傘。我並沒有意圖打算要偷任何人的雨傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you rememer the shape and the colore of the umbrella you took?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶裡，它的顏色是藍色。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can someone prove what you say is truth?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	當我回到博物館時，我的教授和我的兩個朋友當時和我在一起。我的教授甚至本來打算要借我她的雨傘，但是她的雨傘有點小，所以我並沒有接受。我不想要讓教授淋溼，而且我的兩個同學也都在那裏。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, the three person, who were with you, might can come to the cour to prove what you say is truth, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you want the court to imvestigate any evidence for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著要把傘還給陳小姐，但她不接受。我也試著跟她道歉，但是她一句話也不想聽我說。或許我的教授跟我的兩個同學可以證明我說的是實話。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Okay,now I am going to ask Ms. Chen some questions about the detail on that day. Ms. Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went to Ying ge Ceramic museum, and it was rainy. When I entered into the museum, I put my umbrella at the umbrella track. But when I came out, I couldn’t find my umbrella. I asked the staff in the museum to help me find my umbrella, and later I saw this foreigner came back and with my umbrella. When I found out that the umbrella he took was my missing umbrella, I was angry and I asked him: why do you took my umbrella? Don’t you know it was rainy outside? How can you do that without any ethics?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Can you tell me what’s the color of your umbrella and does it have any feature?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The Umbrella I brought that day was blue, I think the color exactly it was deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the photo on page 5 of investigation file one. Does the umbrella in the photo belong to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the photo was very common; everyone can get one at the 7-11. How can you sure that the umbrella is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	That’s true; I bought my umbrella at the 7-11. But my umbrella has some flaws and it cannot be hold tidily. When I filed the case, I specifically described this feature to the police. The umbrella which was taken by the foreigner has the same feature. So, in other words, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant would like to apologize and show his regret, would you consider to settle the case with him?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it is just an umbrella? It is about ethics. If he did not put my umbrella back, did you mean that I need to go home in such rain? I do not want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

en-US	 Ms. Chen, the next court date you can decide to come or not. The main purpose on that day will be to ask defendant’s professor classmates some questions about that day.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	Well won’t show up. I don’t want to take one day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的我當時認為那把傘就是亞當的,我當時並有想要偷任何人的

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the shape and the color of the umbrella you took that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得他是一把藍色的傘,而且不是一把新的傘

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	So the whole is blue…..so the whole umbrella is blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我記憶中那把傘就是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone prove your statement?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的當我離開博物館的時候我的教授跟我兩個同學都跟我一起,我的教授甚至說他要借我他的傘,但是因為他的傘實在太小了,所以我就沒有跟他拿,我不想要他被雨淋濕,而我也不想要另外兩個同學淋濕

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three can prove your statement for you or you can ask them to come to the court to prove, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想應該是可以

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	So do any evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著把傘還他,但他不理我,我也試著向他道歉,但他也是完全不理睬我,或許我的教授跟同學可以為我佐證我說的話,也可以證明我那天的行為

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, let’s move on to Miss Chen. Miss Chen, Can you explain what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	In that day, I…. went to Yigge Ceramic Musem and it was a rainy day. I put my umbrella in. the umbrella rack before I went into the museum. But when I went out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the museum staff to help me to search my umbrella; finally, I found that the defendant took my umbrella. When I found that the umbrella he hold is my umbrella, I was very angry. I question………I said that didn’t you know that it was a rainy day, how can you………..

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	So what’s the shape your umbrella? Does it have any features?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	My umbrella must be blue. It is dark blue…it is a dark blue one.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now I’m going to show you a picture. In the file 1 ……….. Is that umbrella in the picture is yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it’s mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in that picture is very a common one which can buy in 7-11…in the convenience store. How can you sure that the umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought my umbrella in the convenience store. However, there is some defect on my umbrella, it cannot be attached…. closely. I was….I told to the police that feature when I go to the police station. The umbrella backed to the umbrella rack has same feature, so I sure that it is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So if the defendant is regrettable for this case. Do you want to settle this course? However, it is just a umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	Why do you mean “it is a umbrella?” It is concerned about morality. If he didn’t return my umbrella, should I went to home without umbrella? So I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. So we will subpoena the three people the defendant just mentioned to ask to explain what happened in that day. The next court set on the June 19, 2014. 3pm. Do both party can come to the court?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的我會來

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, it is your choice to come or not to come. Basically, we will ask the defendant’s professor and friends to understand the details in that day.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I don’t want to come because ……..

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. So the court dismissed here. Please sign the waiver here, after you sign that, you can leave.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The plaintiff… the case happened in… happened at 2014, May 27th, and the plaintiff went to Yinge Ceramics Museum and took…sorry, sorry, again.

en-US	So, Mr. Ho, can you tell me where were… where were you at 20… 2014, May 27th, 4…um…4:15 in the afternoon?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time, did you… did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	當我要把傘放回傘架時，她就在那裏。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大喊大叫，說我偷了她的傘。我告訴她我應該是拿錯傘了。我並沒有偷她的傘，我試著向她解釋，但她根本不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Then why Ms. Chen said you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	當天我和一些同學到陶瓷館去看一個展覽。我們看完展覽之後，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們決定出去買點吃的，或是決定找個地方吃晚餐。我離開博物館的時候，發現正在下雨，因為我沒有帶傘，所以本來打算跟同學借一把。因為我人比較大隻，所以我打算跟我同學Adam借傘，他的身形跟我比較像。所以我從傘架拿了一把傘。然 後我就和我的教授和朋友去買了點麵包。我們回來的時候，那個時候就是陳小姐開始對我大喊大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you took that day… you borrowed that day, was from your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我以為那把傘是亞當的。我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Can you recall that the umbrella you took that day, the color and the shape…?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，是一把藍色的傘，而且沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Did the whole umbrella was blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	印象中，它就是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anybody can prove what you just said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	可以，當我從陶瓷館出來的時候，我的教授和兩個同學跟我在一起。我教授本來還說要借我她的傘，但她的傘…因為太小了，所以我沒有拿。我不想要教授淋溼，而且我的兩個同學也都在那邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So… the three person, your professor and your two classmates, they can vertify (verify) your words in the court, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence that you want the court investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我曾經…我試著把傘還給陳小姐，但她不拿；我也曾向…我也曾經試著跟他道歉，但她不聽。也許我教授和同學可以證明我所說的是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK. Now I’m going to ask Ms. Chen what happened that day. Ms. Chen can you give us a description what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day, and it was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack outside the museum. When I got out, my umbrella was gone. I ask the staff to look for my umbrella, and that’s the time I saw this foreigner took the umbrella and put it back here. When I found out that umbrella was my missing umbrella, I was furious, and I asked why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside? How can he do such thing?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Can you tell me the… the color and the shape… is there any feature of your umbrella you brought that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	It was blue, and I suppose it was a deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please see the investigatory book and the evident one. Can you tell us is the umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	Actually, this umbrella looks very common, is a very common…it’s a very common type umbrella. You can bought it…you can buy it in 7-11, how can you tell this is exactly your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yeah, it’s true. I bought my umbrella in 7-11. But my umbrella… there is a little bit… there is a little bit broken… a broken part in the bottom, so it cannot function very well. And this point, when I filed the case, I explained it to the police. The umbrella that foreigner put back to the rack has the same feature, so that’s… so I know that was my umbrella. So I knew that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	But if the other side, if this foreigner, have the regretful thought and he wants to apologize, can you… do you consider to forgive him or reach a settlement? Because it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? It’s the problem of someone’s moral questions. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, what do you want? I walked… I walked home in those heavy rain? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. OK. We will… the court will send subpoena to the… those three party, the professor and the two classmates, and ask them to vertify (verify) what the defendant said in the court. The next court will be held at three o’clock afternoon, in 2014, June 19th. And the three witness and the defendant will here. Defendant, is this time OK for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	我可以，我會到場。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	 Ms. Chen, you don’t have to be here in the next court. The main purpose that day will be asking what really happened from… ask professor and his classmates what really happened that day. But if you want to come… but if you want to come, it’s also welcomed.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I don’t think I won’t be...No, I don’t think I will be here. Because I have to took a day off… I have take a day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What’s the color of your umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took on that day is a blue one, deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the investigatory file, page 1. Look at the picture. Is the umbrella in this picture yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is a very common one which can buy in any convenience store. How can you be so sure that umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes I bought it in a convenience store. It’s true but my umbrella’s button is broken. So I can easily recognize it. I told the police when I was at the police station. The umbrella, which the foreigners put back, also shares the trait. So I think that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Will you consider to forgive him if he sincerely apologize to you. It’s just an umbrella, right?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean about it’s just an umbrella? This is something about moral, attitudes. If he didn’t put the umbrella back, maybe I have to go home with the pouring rain. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. OK then we will send three sopeanas to those people he just mentioned and ask them come to the court to explain what happened on that that. The next court is at 3 PM on June19th, in 2014. Is the defendant and your three friends be here? Is that ok with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的我會準時到

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, the next court you can choose to come or not. It depends on you. Basically, we are going to ask the defendant and his friends and his professor. So if you are not here, it’s okay.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I won’t be here. I don’t want…

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	Ok I understand and we will end the court here. Please confirm and sign the documents and then you can go.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The incident happened on May 27th, 2014. The defendant Paul Anderson took away the plaintiff, Hsiao-Chien Chen’s umbrella at the Ceramics Museum in Ying Ge. The defendant took away the plaintiff’s umbrella without telling…without informing her. When you were returning the umbrella, you were found by Hsiao-Chien Chen, and she knew that you took her umbrella away. As a result, she filed for the case. Today…the procedure today…in the procedure today, we would mainly want to know what happened on that day. Please answer the questions in order to let the prosecutor understand what happened on that day, is that OK with you? After that, I would ask the plaintiff what happened on that day. Do you understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	 I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	So defendant, where were you at 4:15 PM on May 27th, 2014?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我那時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Hsiao-Chien Chen at that time?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有，我那時候把傘放回到傘架的時候，就看到她了。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大叫然後說我偷了她的傘。我試著告訴她我應該是拿錯了，我並沒有想要偷她的傘，我想要跟她道歉，但是她就是不聽我說話。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	So why did Miss Chen say you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟我的一些同學去那邊看一個展覽。我們看完之後，我的兩個同學說他們很餓。所以我們就出去想找點吃的，或許就是吃個晚餐這樣吧。正當我要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了。我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟我一個同學借。因為我就是蠻高…蠻大…蠻胖的，所以我想跟我的朋友亞當借一隻傘，他跟我的體型比較像。所以我有從傘架拿了一隻傘，然後我就跟教授去買一些麵包，當我回來的時候陳小姐就開始對我叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You said that the umbrella you borrowed at that time was Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對啊，我以為我拿的傘是亞當的，我沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the umbrella you took…what color it looked like…the umbrella you took that day.

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，然後不是很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the umbrella blue? All over the umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	嗯，回想起來是沒錯。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone prove what you just said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有啊，我那時候走出博物館的時候，我的教授和我的兩個同學都和我在一起。我的教授還說她可以把傘借給我。但因為她的傘很小，我就沒有跟她借。我不想要她淋濕，而且我還有兩個同學在旁邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	 So the above three people can come to the court and prove that…prove what you just said here, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Then what…are there any evidence you want the prosecutor to investigate?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著想把傘還給陳小姐、跟她道歉，但她就是不聽我講話。或許我的教授跟兩個同學可以證明我講的話是正確…真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK, now I would like to ask Miss Chen what happened on that day. Miss Chen, could you please explain what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	On that day I went to Ying Ge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. When I went into the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack, and when I came out, my umbrella was gone. I asked the staff of the museum to look for it for me, and then I see this foreign coming back, wanting to put the umbrella back. When I found that the umbrella he was taking is mine, I was very angry and questioned him why he took my umbrella away. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How can a person have no such responsibility?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	So…what color was your umbrella on that day? What other traits did it have?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought on that day was blue. It was dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please look at the picture on page five on the investigation file. Please take a look at the picture. Is this umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it was that umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on the photo was very ordinary. It’s like one you can buy in 7-11. How can you make sure it was yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I did buy my umbrella at 7-11. However there was a damage on the button part, so I know it was mine. I did explain about this when I filed for the case to the prosecutor. The umbrella which the foreigner put back also possesses that trait…so I know that the umbrella is mine…was mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Then I would like to ask you, if the other…the defendant…is willing to regret and apologize, would you forgive him? Because it was just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by it was just an umbrella? It is a matter of whether he cares for others or not. If he didn’t take the umbrella back, do you want me to go out when it was raining? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. So I will subpoena the three people he mentioned to the court and ask them to prove what he said was right. The next court will be set at 3 PM, June 19th, 2014. Plantiff, defendant, and the three witnesses should be here. Defendant, is the date OK with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	好的，我會到。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, you may come or not in the…on the next court. Basically who we are asking are the defendant’s professor and classmates, but if you would like to come, it will be OK as well.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I don’t think I’m coming. I need to take that day off if I would like to come.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. Then the procedure ends here today. Please leave the court after you sign for the record.

I ask the staff to help me find it. Later I saw the foreigner put the umbrella back. I was angry. Ask him why did you take my umbrella? Didn’t he know it was raining outside? How a person can be so impolite?

en-US	Indeed, I bought it in 7-11. But the locker part of the umbrella is broken. It cannot luck. When I report the case, I explained it to the police carefully. The umbrella the foreigner put back has the same feature, so it is my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the other party is willing to apologize, could you forgive him? It is just an umbrella..

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it is just an umbrella? It is about whether a person is ….. if he did not return it, are you going to tell me I should go home in the big rain? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The defendant, Paul Anderson, on May 27, 2014 went to Inge Museum and had taken the umbrella of the plaintiff, Xiao-Chen Cheng. This act was committed without notifying the plaintiff beforehand. When you were going to return the umbrella, you were caught red-handed with the umbrella by the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff pressed the charge. The goal of our procedure today, is to understand what happened that day. Please answer accordingly to my questions, do you understand? Later on, I will also inquire the plaintiff to understand what happened that day. Do both parties understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	 I understand, too. 

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	This question is for the defendant. On 4:15PM of May 27th 2014, where were you?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我在鶯歌博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen, at that time?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有，我當時要把傘放回傘架時有看到他

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她向我大叫，說我偷了她的傘。我嘗試告訴他我可能搞錯了，拿錯傘。我並不是在偷他的傘，我…嘗試要向他解釋，但他不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Then why would Ms. Chen say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和幾個同學一起去看展。看完展後，我有幾個同學說他們餓了。所以我們決定出去找個東西吃，可能找個地方吃晚餐。當我們要離開博物館時，我們發現開始下雨了。因為我本來沒有帶傘，我本來要和我同學借。因為我身形比較高大，我本來要和我朋友亞當借傘。他的體型和我比較相近。之後我就從傘架裡面抽了一支傘，然後和我的教授和同學們出去了。當我們回來的時候，就是被陳小姐大罵的時候。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	So you mean the umbrella you borrowed belonged to Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我以為我手中那隻傘是亞當的，而我沒有意圖偷那支傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得傘的顏色，他是藍色的，也不是新的那種。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	The whole umbrella is blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	回想起來，傘的確是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone prove that for you?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有，當我離開博物館的時候，教授和兩個同學都在我身邊。我的教授甚至主動借我他的傘。但是因為他的傘比較小，我就沒有答應他。我不想要老師林濕。當然我另外兩個同學…當時也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three people you mentioned will be able to come to court to prove your statement, is that right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Are there any evidence you wish the prosecutor to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我想要歸還傘給陳小姐，但他不願意拿。我嘗試向她道歉，但她不願意聽我說。或許我的教授和朋友們可以幫我證明我今天講的話屬實。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	All right, now I will inquire Ms. Chen for what happened that day. Ms. Chen, can you explain what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	When I went to Inge Museum, it was raining then. When I entered the museum, I placed my umbrella in to the umbrella rack. But when I came out, my umbrella was missing. I asked the museum staff to help me look for the umbrella. And when I came back, I found this person returning the umbrella. When I realized the umbrella in his hands belonged to me, I was very angry and I asked him why did he take my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside, how could he be so impolite?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What color was your umbrella? Are there any characteristics to it?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought to the museum that day was blue. It should be dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella in this picture…Does this umbrella belong to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, this is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is a very…. common umbrella. The kind of umbrella you can find in 7-11, how do you know the umbrella belongs to you?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	That’s true, I bought my umbrella at 7-11, but the button on my umbrella is a bit broken. On this point, when I filed the case to the police, I emphasized this point.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	The umbrella the foreigner placed in the umbrella rack had the same characteristic, so I knew the umbrella was mine. May I ask you if he regrets what he did and is willing to apologize, are you willing to forgive him? I mean it is only an umbrella after all.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by “it’s only an umbrella.” If he didn’t return it to me that day, I would have to go home in the rain. I am not willing to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. Then we will send warrants to the three people… the three witnesses that day, and ask them to come to court. The next court will be held on June 19th 2014, at 3PM, the three witnesses and the defendant should be here in court. Do you understand?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是，我會到場。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The plaintiff, Ms. Chen, the next court you can choose to come at your will. Basically, this is an inquiry for the defendant and his two classmates and professor, so it will be all right if you don’t come.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I think not… because I’d have to… take a day off from work.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. All right, our court ends here. May the two parties please sign here, and you may leave.

en-US	The incident happens on May 27, 2014. The defendant Paul Anderson took an umbrella when he was in Ying Ge Ceramics Museum, and the defendant Paul Anderson took the plaintiff’s umbrella without informing her. When the defendant wanted to return the umbrella back to its owner, Hsiao-Chien Wang…caught him. Therefore, Hsiao-Chien Wang filed this case. In today’s procedure, we need to mainly understand what happened that day. Please answer all of my questions so that the prosecutor can understand what exactly happened that day, do you understand?

en-US	Defendant, where were you at four fifteen, on May 27, in year 2014? Four fifteen in the afternoon….

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我那時在三峽鶯歌陶瓷的博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	 Did you see the plaintiff Hsiao-Chien Chen at that time?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有，在我把傘放回傘架時，小倩小姐就在那理。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她大喊:「是你偷了我的傘!」我告訴她我應該是拿錯傘了啦。我真的沒有偷她的傘，我一直試著跟她道歉，但是她就是不接受。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Then why did Hsiao-Chien Chen claimed you of stealing her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天，我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館參展看展啊。看完展覽後，其中有兩個同學就說他們餓了。所以我們就決定出去找找食物，找個能吃晚餐的地方。一離開博物館的時候，就下雨了。因為我沒有帶雨傘，所以我就決定借我同學的傘。因為我比較高壯一點，所以我就決定借我同學亞當的傘，因為他的體型跟我很像。所以我就從傘架拿出一個傘，然後和我的教授和兩個朋友一起去買麵包。當我們這群人回到博物館後，陳小姐就對我大喊。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	 So do you mean that at that time, the umbrella that you borrowed was…you borrowed it from Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的。我當時是真的認為是亞當的傘。我根本就沒有想到要偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Then do you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you took that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，然後沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	據我所知，對，全部都是藍的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can someone proof what you said was right?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	可以啊，跟我出去的教授還有兩位同學一起來開博物館，他們可以證明。我教授甚至還願意借我他的雨傘。但是由於他的傘太小，所以我就謝絕他。而且我也不希望我的教授淋雨啊，那時候我兩個同學都在。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	If so, then these three people will be able to come to the court and play as the role of the witnesses, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	應該可以吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Then is there anything else you wish the prosecutor to investigate?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著要還給陳小姐她的傘了，但是她不接受，然後我試著跟她道歉，她也不接受。我認為我的教授和兩位同學都來到這裡證明我所說得一切都是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Okay, now let me ask Ms. Chen what really happened that day. Can you describe what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	That day, it was raining, and I went to the Ceramics Museum in Ying Ge. Before entering the museum, I placed my umbrella on the umbrella rack. But when I came out of the museum, my umbrella was gone. I asked one of the workers in the museum to help me find the umbrella, and I saw this young man taking my umbrella at that time. When I saw my umbrella on his hand, I was very, very furious, and I questioned him loudly why he would want to take my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining hard at that time? Did he have any conscience?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Then may I ask you that what color was your umbrella that you brought that day? Did it have any special symbols?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	Well, the umbrella that I brought that day was blue. It was dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now let us look at evidence number one, page five. Please take a look at this photo. Was this umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s it. That’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture was just a very, very normal umbrella, which can be purchased in any convenience store, such as 7-11. How can you prove that this was the umbrella that you brought that day?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	You’re right, I brought the umbrella at 7-11. However, there is something wrong with my umbrella. The button of my umbrella couldn’t work. Therefore, when I filed this case, I had explained clearly to the police about this trait. Moreover, the umbrella that this foreigner took and put back had this trait, too; therefore, I can prove that that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Then, now the defendant apologized to you…is willing to apologize to you and showed some regrets, are you willing to forgive the defendant? Because it’s just….he accidentally took your umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	 Hey, what do you mean by saying that it was just an umbrella? It shows that this person has no conscience. I assume that if that person didn’t return my umbrella back to me on that day, then I would just end up being all wet. I will not forgive the defendant.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Okay, I understand now. We will subpoena the three people as witnesses to the court, the three people that the defendant just mentioned. We’ll set up a time to open a court next time at three o’ clock pm, on June 19, 2014, and the defendant plus the three witnesses should all be here. Defendant, do you understand?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我了解了。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	As for Ms. Chen, the plaintiff, you can come to the court next time, or you can choose not to. Basically, during the next court…the procedure of the next court, we will mainly ask the witnesses, including the professor what happened that day.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	Well, I won’t come on that day because I even need to take a leave.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我喊說，我偷了她的雨傘。我試著跟她說，我是拿錯傘了。我並沒有都她的雨傘，我試著跟她道歉，但她都不理我。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Then, how come the plaintiff said that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	在那天，我跟我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館。當我們逛完博物館後，有兩個同學說他們肚子餓了。所以我們想出去買晚餐，或是找個地方吃晚餐。當我要離開的時候，我發現外面在下雨。我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想要借我朋友的傘。因為我有點高大，所以想跟我的同學亞當借雨傘。他的體型跟我較接近。然後我就從傘架拿了一把傘。然後我就和我的教授跟朋友一起買了麵包。但我回來的時候，陳小姐就對我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Did you say that the umbrella you borrowed belonged to your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	沒錯，我之前看，是亞當拿著那把雨傘，我並沒有想要偷雨傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember the color as well as the shape of the umbrella you borrowed?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，那把傘是藍色的，不是很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	So, was the umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	我記得那把傘是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Was there any person or witness can prove what you just said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	當然有，當時我看我的教授和兩個朋友一起出來。我教授也想借我傘呢。但我教授的傘太小了，我辦法拿。我不想要讓我的教授和朋友被雨淋濕。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, those three people can go to the court as witnesses to prove what you just said. Is that right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我是這麼覺得。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence which you hope that the prosecutor can investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著想把傘還給陳小姐，但她不接受，我也想試著道歉，但她又不願意接受。也與我的教授還有同學可以證明我剛才所說的話。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Okay, now the court will ask the plaintiff questions about what happened on that day. Miss Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it was rainy on that day. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the umbrella rack outside. When I came out, I found that my umbrella disappeared. I asked the personnel in the museum to help me find my umbrella. However, I later saw the defendant come to the museum with my umbrella. When I saw he held my umbrella, I was very angry and yelled why you took my umbrella. Didn’t you know that it was rainy outside? How could you do this?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Can the court the features of your umbrella you brought on that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	It was blue, very deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the picture on the page 5 of the investigatory file 1. Is the umbrella in the picture belonging to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it was my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on the picture could be commonly bought in convenient stores. How could you assure that the umbrella was yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought my umbrella in 7-11. However, the bottom on my umbrella was broken. I could recognize my umbrella with the broken feature. As to this feature, I had made my explanations to the police. The umbrella returned by the foreigner also had the same characteristic. Therefore, I was sure that that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	The plaintiff, will you consider to settle the case if the defendant shows his regret and wants to apologize to you because it was just an umbrella?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it was just an umbrella? It was a common moral issue among people. If the defendant didn’t return my umbrella, I would get very wet when I went home! I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Okay, I understand. The court will subpoena the three people that the defendant just mentioned as witnesses for the case. The next court day will be set at 3:00 p.m. on June 19th, 2014. Both the people and the defendant have to attend the court on that day. The defendant, can you make it on that day?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	好的，我沒問題。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The plaintiff, you can come to the court if you want. Basically, the court will ask questions with the professor and the two classmates. You also can show up if you wanted.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	Well, I think I will not show up on that day because I have to ask for a leave.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	Okay, I understand. Today’s procedure will end here. Both parties, please sign the document before you leave.

zh-TW	今為偷竊案件偵字1425號偵查程序
en-US	Today we are here for investigatory procedure, case number 1425, theft.

zh-TW	那天我和一些同學一起去看一些展覽，當我們看完展覽時，我2位同學說他們餓了，所以我們決定出去買一些食物並找地方吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，我發現下雨了，我沒有帶傘，所以我想要跟我同學借傘。因為我非常高，也有點壯，所以我決定向我的朋友Adam借傘。因為他的身形跟我比較相似。所以我就從傘架拿一把傘，然後我和我的教授去買一些麵包給我的朋友。當我回來時，陳小姐就開始對我大吼大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean the umbrella you borrowed was your friend Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.

I asked the working staff in the museum to help me to find my umbrella and then I just saw the foreigner just put the umbrella back to the rack. When I found that the umbrella he took was the umbrella I have lost, I was very angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside? Why did he so mean?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	So what was the color of the umbrella you brought that day? Did that have any characteristic?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The color of the umbrella I brought that day was blue, and it’s dark blue

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please check the investigatory record on page 5, is the umbrella belongs to you on that picture?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture was very common that can be bought in 7-11, how can you make sure that umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought my umbrella in 7-11; however, the bottom of my umbrella was a little broken, so I cannot just… When I reported the case, I have explained to the police. The umbrella the foreigner put back has also this characteristic, so I am sure that umbrella is mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So if the foreigner have regretted and is also willing to apologize, do you plan to forgive him? Because you have lost is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What does it mean it just an umbrella? The problem now is that this is an issue about the moral. If he didn’t return the umbrella, you wanted me to got wet on that day? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

Would that time be ok for you, the defendant?

zh-TW	嗯，我可以到

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The plaintiff Ms. Chen, you can be there or not, it’s up to you. The main purpose on that day is to ask the defendant’s professor and his classmates. If you want to come, it will be ok.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, if I come, I will have to take days off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand, so the court will dismiss here today. So both parties you can leave after signing the paper.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	On the 7th of May 2014, Mr. Paul Anderson is accused of taking Xiao Qian Chen’s umbrella in Yingge Ceramics Museum. The incident happened without informing the plaintiff. When you were about to return the umbrella, you were caught by the plaintiff  Xiao Qian Chen. Therefore, she has filed this case. In today’s incident we want to find out what happened on that day. Please elaborate on my question, it will help the court to understand what happened. Later, I will also ask the plaintiff for details to further understand about the incident.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, what were you doing on the 27th of May, 2014 at 4:15PM?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	So did you see the Plaintiff Xiao Qian Chen? 

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	對, 幫我把雨傘放回傘架, 陳小姐就在那裡

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that moment?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我咆嘯, 說我偷她的雨傘. 我試著告訴她我一定是拿錯雨傘了, 我並沒有偷她的傘, 我有試著道歉但她聽不進去

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	So why did the plaintiff said that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和我的一些同學, 參觀了陶瓷博物館的一個展覽, 我們那時候已經看完展覽了, 我的兩個同學說他們餓了. 那時候我們想說去找點食物吃, 順便吃晚餐. 當我要離開陶瓷博物館的時候, 我發現外面正在下大雨. 我沒有帶雨傘, 所以打算向同學借雨傘. 因為我長得比較高大, 所以我打算跟我同學Adam借傘, 他的體型跟我差不多. 所以我就從傘架拿了一把傘, 我和我的教授去買一些麵包. 當我們回來的時候, 那時候陳小姐就開始對我們大吼大叫.

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean at that time, the umbrella you took was Adam’s umbrella?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對我那時候以為我拿到的是Adam的傘, 我並沒有想要偷別人的傘

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember what kind of umbrella you took? Color or shape?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得是藍色的傘而且不是新的傘

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	So was the umbrella all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶中, 傘是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone verify or prove your statement?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的, 當我走出博物館時我的教授和兩位同學在我旁邊, 我教授甚至要借我她的雨傘, 但她的雨傘太小所以我就沒有跟她借了, 我不希望她淋濕而且那時候其他兩位同學也在

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	They should be able to come to the court and witness what you said right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想應該是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any other evidence that you wish the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我有試著把傘還給陳小姐但她不接受, 我也試著跟她道歉但她也不接受或許我的教授和同學能證明我剛剛講的都是事實

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, now I’m going to ask Miss. Chen what happened on that day. Miss. Chen, can you elaborate on the incident, what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	That day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and it was raining. I put the umbrella in the umbrella rack when I entered the museum. And after I finished the exhibition, my umbrella wasn’t there anymore. I asked the museum staff to help me find my umbrella, it was then I discovered that this foreigner took my umbrella. I was very angry to discover that he took my umbrella so I yelled at him and ask him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was raining outside? How could he done such thing.

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What umbrella did you bring that day? The color or shape?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought was blue, dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please see the investigatory file1, is the umbrella in the photo your umbrella?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is very common, you can buy this umbrella in any convenience store like Seven-Eleven. How can you prove that this is the one that’s stolen?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Ya, it’s true, I bought my umbrella in Seven-Eleven. But my umbrella has a broken piece at its buckle so it cannot function very well. On this point, I told the police. Then the umbrella that foreinger put back has the same feature as I said. So I’m sure he took my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant regret about the incident and want to apologize and reconcile, are you willing to settle this case?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by just an umbrella? If he didn’t return the umbrella, I would have to return home all wet. I don’t want to forgive hime.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	It’s okay, I don’t want to take one day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他當時就對我大吼，說我偷了他的傘，但是我…我只是，我好像只是拿錯了傘而已，我並沒有要偷他傘的意思。我試著想要跟他道歉，但他不願意聽我說話。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did the plaintiff say you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	在那天，去鶯歌博物館…看展覽的時候，我是與我的同學一起去的。然後在…在後來有兩個同學講說他們其實...就是他們感覺有點餓了，然後我們就想說要出博物館去找食物吃，就解決我們的晚餐，這樣子。在我準備要離開博物館的時候，我發現說正在下雨，那我就打算跟我的同學借一把雨傘，因為我沒有帶傘這樣子。因為我長得又高又…大，所以我就想要借我同學，亞當的傘，因為他跟我的身型很類似。於是我就從雨架上拿了一把雨傘，然後跟我的教授一起出去買麵包，跟一些其他東西吃，那在我們回來的時候，我就發現陳小姐就在傘架附近，然後開始對我大吼。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Well… So what you mean is that the umbrella belonged to your friend, Adam? Is that right?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我當時真的以為我拿的是亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Well… did you… do you remember what’s the color or the shape of the umbrella?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.

zh-TW	是的…在我離開博物館的時候，我跟…我身旁有我的教授，還有我兩位同學，那我教授當時還原本要…就是借我他的傘。因為我教授他的傘蠻小的，所以我就沒有接受，因為我不想要淋濕。那我兩個同學都在旁邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Therefore, the three witness should… be able to be here as the witness for you verify what you just stated.

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	在當時，我試著想要把傘還給陳小姐，但是他不願意接受，那在當時我也試著想要跟他道歉，可是他也不願意接受我的道歉，那在當時我的教授以及我兩個同學都在一旁，那他們應該可以證實我說的是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	I understand that, then the plaintiff, what happened that day. Ms. Chen, could you tell us what happened that day?

en-US	At that time… on that day, I visit Yingge Ceramics Museum, and it was raining. And I put my umbrella on the rack, but I came out of the museum, I found that my umbrella was gone. I ask the staff of the museum to find the umbrella for me, and after a while, I saw the foreigner put my umbrella back on the rack. And I found out… the umbrella he returned was mine, and I was… I was furious. How could someone so shameful that knowing it was raining and he took some else umbrella?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What’s the color or some… something special about the umbrella? Could you tell us the color or anything special about the umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。

en-US	Now, I’m going to show you the investigatory file, on page 5, the pictures…the plaintiff, could you tell us, in the picture, does the umbrella belong to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	In the photo, the umbrella is very common and very ordinary, and that is the kind of umbrella you can buy in 7-11. How could you be so sure that the umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, my umbrella was bought in 7-11, but the umbrella… the umbrella I brought that day, the button was a little bit broken, so it cannot be… button up. On that day, when I was making the court script, I tell the police the same thing that my umbrella… the button on my umbrella was broken, so it cannot be button up. And the umbrella the foreigner put back on the rack has the same signature… has the same characteristic.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Would you… forgive the defendant if the defendant show some regret and they apologize to you. Are you willing to forgive him? After all, it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by that was just an umbrella? It is an issue of morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella for me, then I have to want home without my umbrella, and it was raining on that day.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Okay… I understand. Then we will subpoena the three witness… the defendant just mentioned. And the next proceeding will set at 3 P.M… 3 o’clock in the afternoon, on June 25th, 2018. And in the next proceeding, there will be the three witness the defendant just mentioned and ask us to subpoena. The defendant… are you okay with the date?

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The time of the incident is on May 27th, 2018. The defendant Paul Anderson went to Yingge Ceramics Museum and stole the accuser Xiaoqian Chen’s umbrella. Because the defendant Paul Anderson didn’t inform the accuser, and when the accuser returned the umbrella to the original spot, he was caught on the spot. So the accuser filed a lawsuit to the defendant Paul Anderson. In today’s procedure, the court mainly wants to understand what happened on May 27th, 2018. And we will ask the both party to clarify the situation on that day. And do the both party understand the procedure today? Also, I will ask the accuser to know more about the details on May 27th, 2018. Do the both party understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand too.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Where were you at 4:15 pm, on May 27th, 2018?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館裡面

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time, did you see the accuser Ms. Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，當我把雨傘歸還到架子上時，陳小姐就在旁邊

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	And, what happened at that time? 

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	當時，她對我大吼然後說我偷她的傘，我試圖想跟她解釋，應該是我拿錯了，但她不理我。我試著要跟她道歉，但她都不聽解釋。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我是跟同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽，當我們看完最後一個展物的時候，其中兩個同學跟我說他們很餓，所以我們就打算出去找一些吃的，然後去吃晚餐。當時，當我要走出去覓食的時候，我發現外面下雨了。因為我沒有帶傘，所以我就想跟其中一個同學借傘。因為我長得比較高、比較大一隻，我就想跟亞登借傘，因為他的體型跟我比較像，所以我就跟他借傘。然後我就從架上拿了一把傘，我就跟我的一位教授跟其他兩位同學出去買一些麵包。那當我回來的時候我把傘歸還時，陳小姐就對我大吼了，這就是當時的狀況。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Well, so did you mean that the umbrella you borrowed belog to your friend Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我是以為那把傘就是Adam他所帶的那把，我完全沒有想偷別人傘的意思。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	What color and shape of umbrella that you borrowed on that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得我當時借的那把傘是藍色的，但它不是全新的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the color of the umbrella all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我印象當中，它是全部都藍色的沒錯。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Did anyone can prove what you said is true?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，當時跟我同行去買晚餐的的教授跟同學可以為我作證。當時，教授甚至有看到我借了Adam的那把傘。那是因為教授的傘比較小，我不希望身體弄濕，所以我就沒有跟她借。然後跟我同行的其他兩位同學也知道這件事。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, did the three person, your professor, and two of your classmates can come to the proceeding and speak up for you?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	是，我想應該是這樣沒錯

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you want the prosecutor to investigate any further evidence for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	當時，當我把傘歸還的時候，陳小姐對我大吼，不想聽我說的任何話。她也不接受我的道歉，我想我的教授及兩位同學能夠到庭為我解釋，能夠證明我說的話是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Well, then I will ask the accuser to clarify the details of the incident on that day?Miss Chen, can you briefly describe what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	On that day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was a rainy day, and I put my umbrella on the rack outside the museum. When I went out the museum, and I found my umbrella was gone. Then I asked the curators of the museum to help me find my umbrella, and I saw the defendant just came back and returned my umbrella to the rack. When I found out that the foreigner took my umbrella. And it was he stole my umbrella, so I was very angry and asked him why he stole my umbrella? Didn’t he know that it was raining outside ? and why he didn’t have a conscience? 

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Miss Chen, what color is your umbrella? And does your umbrella have any traits?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day is blue, and I think it’s deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Show exhibit evidence, page fifteen, is the picture on the file your umbrella?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	In the picture, the umbrella is just very normal one, that people can buy from 7-11.How can you confirm that umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, my umbrella was bought from 7-11, but in my umbrella, its button is a little bit damaged, and I cannot close my umbrella well. When I reported to the police, I had described the details of this matter. Because the umbrella that the foreigner returned to the track also had the button trait, so I can prove that the umbrella was mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Well, the accuser, if the defendant has regretted what he had done and apologized to you, will you forgive him? After all, the stole item is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that just an umbrella? Is the defendant don’t have a     conscience, and what if he didn’t return the umbrella to the rack, so that I have to go back home under the big rain, you know that? So I won’t forgive him even he apoliogizes.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Well, I see. So I will subpoena three witnesses to the court and ask them what happened on that day. And the next proceeding will be held at 3 pm on June 25th, 2018. In the next proceeding, the defendant and the three witnesses will come to the proceeding and will clarify the details of the incident. Does the time of the next proceeding you can come to the court?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我那個時間可以到庭

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The accuser, Miss Chen, in the next proceeding, you can choose whether to come to the court, because we mainly want to ask the defendant and the three witnesses the details of that day. You are fine to come to the proceeding if you want.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I won’t come to the next proceeding, because I have to take a day off my work.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	OK, I understand. Then today’s proceeding is adjourned. After you signed the court script, and you can leave.

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why Ms. Chen said that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

zh-TW	是的，當我出來時有位教授跟兩位同學跟著我，而教授還打算把他的傘借給我，因為他的雨傘比較小，所以我沒跟他借，因為我不想被淋濕，而我當時另外兩個同學也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?

zh-TW	我嘗試把傘還給陳小姐，但他不接受，而我也嘗試跟他道歉，但他也一樣不接受，或許當天我的同學以及教授可以幫我證明這段話。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Okay, now I want to ask Ms. Chen what happened that day. Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened that day?

en-US	I went to the ceramic museum that day, and when I go there, it’s raining. And I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack. When I come back, the umbrella was not there. I ask the staff to help me, and then I saw this foreigner put it back. When I realized the umbrella he put back was mine, I was very angry. I ask him did you know it’s raining now?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	I should be the dark blue one.

en-US	Yes, this is mine.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on the picture is common. It’s sold in every 711 stores. How could you say that it is yours? How did you recognize it?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought it in 711, but …the bottom on my umbrella was broke. So that cannot be closed. I explained to the police at that time. And the umbrella that foreigner put back has this description as I said.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Then if he is…if the defendant is regret about that and he will apologize to you, will you forget him? After all, it is an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it is just an umbrella. It’s about the moral issue. It was raining that day, so if he took the umbrella, I’ll pour in rain that day.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

en-US	The accused, the time was happened on May 27th 2018, and happened at Yingge Ceramics Museum. The accuser Xiaoqian Chen prosecuted you for her taking her umbrella without asking her, and after Xiaoqian Chen found you and umbrella at the same time. Today’s procedure is mainly for the court to know what happened at that time. Please answer all the questions to the prosecutor and the court for them to have more understanding of the whole incident. Do you understand? And later I will also ask the accuser to state…to all the parties…involved parties know the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	The accused, I want to ask where were you at 4:15 May 27th 2018 ?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time did you see the accuser Xiaoqian Chen…at that time?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的當我把傘放進傘桶後就看到她。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對著我大吼說我偷走她的傘，而我只是想告訴她我拿錯了傘，我試著道歉，但她不想聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did Miss Chen said you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我後幾位同學去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館，在參觀完一些展覽之後我們肚子就有點餓，就想出去買個食物順便找一下晚餐的吃飯的地點，當我走出去博物館時就發現正在下雨，所以我就向我的同學借一把傘，因為我的體型比較高大，所以我當時是想跟Adam(我的一個同學)借傘，因為他的體型和我比較相似，於是我傘桶拿出一把傘，並且和一位教授、兩個同學去買麵包，當我回來時，就遇到Miss Chen 在傘桶旁邊對我大吼。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	What did you mean as that the umbrella is borrowed from your classmates Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的我當時認為我是借他的傘，我並沒有意圖去偷或拿走任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember the color, the shape of the umbrella you took at that time?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得是藍色的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is that umbrella filled with blue on the surface?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我認知中，它是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can somebody prove what you have said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的我的教授與兩位朋友可以為我證明，我教授甚至想要借我他的傘，因為教授的傘比較小，怕會因此而淋濕，因此沒有跟他借，我當時兩位同學都在那邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Then, the professor and two of your friends can come to the court to prove what you have said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Then do you have any case for court to investigate for your evidence?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著把傘還她，並且對她道歉，但她都無法接受，我相信我的教授與兩位朋友能夠到庭證明我的清白，還有證明我說的都是事實。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	I see. Now I’ll ask Miss Chen for what...for the case at that time.Miss Chen, could you explain what happend at that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I visited the Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was rainy that day, so after I went into the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. When I came out of the museum, it was gone! I ask the assistance from the museum to help me to find my umbrella, but after that I saw this foreigner hold my umbrella. When I realized he was holding my umbrella, I ask him angrily why he stole my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was rainy? And didn’t he have any kind of…

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	 What’s the color of your umbrella? And does it has any…features?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day was blue. It’s dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	 Let’s look at the exhibition 1. Now you see the picture is that umbrella belong from you ?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is just very common. Everyone can buy that in 7-11, the convenience store. How could you so confidence that is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s true my umbrella was brought at 7-11, but the button of my umbrella has some broken. It is hard to push it…push the button. I have explained this for the police when I was at the police station. And also, the accused… the umbrella accused at that time has this feature, so that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the accused is regretted about his behavior also apologize with you, could you just forget this case? In case this is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it is just an umbrella? It is a very important sense of humanity. Do you know at that day if I don’t have an umbrella, you tell me that I just walk in the rain and go home without an umbrella?

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I see, we will send the ticket to subpoena the witness for the next procedure and our procedure was set at 3:00 pm June 25th 2018. The accuser and the witness have to come to the court. The accuser, is this time available for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的我到時候會出庭

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, the accuser, you can…decide whether you want to come to the court next time because our next procedure was mainly to ask the witness of the accused to explain the whole situation at that time.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I won’t come. If I come here, I have to take off from my work.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. And this is today’s procedure…the procedure is dismissed. Please sign the court script then you can leave the court.

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他當時對我大吼，說我偷了他的雨傘，我嘗試跟他解釋說，我並沒有偷他的傘，我只是拿錯了傘，我試圖跟他道歉，但他不想聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining.

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	在那天，我和我同學一起去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽，看完展覽之後，我的同學跟我說，他們有點餓，於是我們想出去買些吃的，甚至是找個地方能讓我們來吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，我發現正在下雨，而我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想說我要跟我的同學借一把傘，因為我的體型比較高大，所以我想像我的朋友Adam借傘，因為他的體型跟我差不多，於是我拿著傘和教授和兩個同學去買麵包，當我回來時，陳小姐就在那裏對我大吼。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Well, do you meant that the umbrella you borrowed was from your friend, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我當時以為我拿的雨傘是Adam的。我並沒有想要偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Then, did you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella that you take at that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，那把傘是藍色的，而且不是一把很新的傘。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella wholly in blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶裡，那支傘是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone could verify your statement?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，當我和我的教授和兩位同學離開博物館時，我的教授還打算把他的傘借給我，而因為他的傘比較小，所以我沒有跟他借，因為我不想讓他淋濕，而我另外兩名同學也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Then, three of them could come to the court and help you verify what you just stated, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想應該是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any evidence that would like the court to help you investigate?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我嘗試把傘還給陳小姐，但他不接受，我也嘗試向陳小姐道歉，他也不接受。或許我的同學和教授能幫我證明我今天所說的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, now I would like to ask Ms. Chen about what happened at that day. Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened at that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	At that particular day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was raining. I put my umbrella in the umbrella rack in the front door. And when I come back, the umbrella was gone. I asked the museum staff to help me find the umbrella, and I saw this foreigner put the umbrella back on the rack. When I realized the umbrella he took was mine, I was very angry；I ask him “Didn’t he know it was raining out there? Did he even has any conscious? “

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Please describe the color and the shape of the umbrella that you brought to the museum at that day.

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	Well, the umbrella I took to the museum was blue. I believe it was in the deep blue color.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now, I would like to show Exhibit 1 page 5. Is the umbrella on this picture yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is merely a regular umbrella. It is the kind of umbrella that you could easily get in a 7-11 store. How could you be so sure that this is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, of course, I bought my umbrella at 7-11 store. However, the button of my umbrella is a little bit broken so that it cannot be packed properly. I explain this point to the Police specifically at that time, and the umbrella that the foreigner put back on the rack matched the description. So I believed that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Then, if the defendant has showed remorse and apologize to you. Would you be willing to forgive him? Because it is merely an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it is only an umbrella? I think this is a basic moral issue. If he didn’t return the umbrella, how would I be able to go home? What? Did he want me to go home under pouring rain?

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	那天我跟我的兩位同學去看展覽，在我們看完以後，我同學他們覺得很餓，所以我想說我們去買些食物，找個地方來吃晚餐。當我們要離開博物館時，外面正在下雨，我當時沒有帶雨傘，我就跟我同學借一把。因為我有點身材有點高大，所以我跟我同學亞當借雨傘，因為他的體身形比較寬，跟我比較相似。於是我從雨傘架上拿了雨傘，我去幫我教授們買了麵包，我回來之後就看到陳小姐對著我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?

zh-TW	我只記得雨傘顏色是藍的，然後並不是很新

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the umbrella all in blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象中，雨傘是藍色的

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can someone that prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，我當時跟著教授還有兩位同學走出來。當時我教授想要借我雨傘。因為他的雨傘比較小，而我不想要淋濕，所以我選擇跟我另外兩位同學借。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Then three of them can come to the court to help you verify right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any evidence for the prosecutor to help you investigate in?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我想要把雨傘還給陳小姐，但她並不接受。我也想要跟她道歉，但她也不領情。我想我的教授跟我的兩位同學可以幫我做證吧。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok, so I would like to ask Mrs. Chen what happened on that day. Mrs. Chen, could you tell me what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	 I went Yingee Ceramics Museum that day, it was raining, so I put my umbrella in the rack. After I came out, my umbrella was gone. I ask the janitor of the museum to help me find it. But after I saw this foreigner, and I saw my umbrella. When I discovered that my umbrella was taken by him, I was so angry. I ask him why did you take my umbrella? Do you know it’s raining outside now? How can you behave like this? Do you have any moral ethics?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What’s the color of your umbrella, and did it have any special features?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day is blue, I guess it’s a dark blue umbrella.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Please show the exhibit one. Mrs. Chen, is that the umbrella you brought that day?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it was the umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture was just a common one. And you can buy it form anywhere like 7-11. How can you be so sure that it was yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	That’s true, that was the umbrella I bought from 7-11, and there are some damages around the button on the umbrella. At that time, I told the police about the damage on the button, and it was put on the rack, after which was taken by this guy.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Then, if the other party would like to apologize, and he knew that he was wrong. Could you forgive him since it was just an umbrella?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What did you mean that it’s just an umbrella? Do you know that what the situation was? It’s raining big outside. Did you want to go back home without any umbrella?

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Oh, I see. Well, I will send the subpoena to the three witness, and the next proceeding will be set at 3:00p.m., june 25th, 2018. The defendant and three witness will come to the court. The defendant, is the date ok with you?

zh-TW	是的，我會到庭

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Mrs, Chen, you can either show up or not on that day since we are going to ask three witnesses about what happened that day.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, because I don’t want to take the other day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand, so today’s proceeding was off. Both parties, please sign up in here.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The incident happened on May 27th, 2018. The defendant Paul Anderson took Xiao-Cian Chen’s umbrella at Yingge Ceramics Museum. The defendant did not inform the accuser of taking her umbrella. When the defendant returned the umbrella to Xiao-Cian Chen, she caught the defendant on spot. She then filed a lawsuit against Paul Anderson.The procedure today is mainly to understand what happened on that day. The court will ask questions.

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是，當我把雨傘放回去的時候，原告陳小倩在場。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened on that day?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她當時大叫說我偷了她的雨傘，但我只是錯拿了雨傘而已。我有試著要道歉，但她不願意聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did the accuser said you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和同學們去看展覽，看完展覽後有兩個同學說肚子餓了，我們決定去買晚餐，或是找個地方坐下來吃晚餐。當我要離開博物館時，發現下大雨了，我原本想和我的同學借傘。因為我的個子比較高、比較大隻，所以我決定和我的同學亞當借傘，他的身形和我比較像。我就從架子裡面拿了傘，然後和其他人去買麵包，當我回來的時候，原告陳小姐就對我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean the umbrella you borrowed at the time belongs to your classmate Adam.

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對我以為我拿的雨傘是亞當的，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember what’s the color and pattern of the umbrella?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色是藍色的，然後不是很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	The whole umbrella is blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的記憶裡，它是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone can prove what you just stated is true?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有，當我出來的時候，我的教授和兩位同學都在，我教授原本還想要幫我撐傘，但是我覺得教授的傘太小了，我也不想要教授淋濕，其他兩位同學也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three people can come to the court and prove what you stated is true, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any other evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	當時我試著要還她傘，但她不願意拿；當時我也試著要道歉，但她不願意接受，我相信我的教授和兩位同學，都可以證明我所述為實。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Then I am going to ask Ms. Chen about what happened on that day.Ms. Chen could you describe the situation on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day. It was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack and when I get back, it was gone. I asked the workers in the museum to find for me and the foreigner just took the umbrella back. When I saw my umbrella in his hand, I was really angry. I asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining on that day? How could he do such an immoral thing?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What the color of the umbrella you took with you on that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took on that day was blue, dark blue.

en-US	Exbit1. Page5. The picture of the umbrella. Does the umbrella belong to you ?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s exactly my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	It’s a really normal umbrella. It’s sold at 7-11. How can you be so sure that it’s your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought this umbrella at 7-11. But my umbrella has some problems at the button. It’s kind of broken. It cannot really buckle up. When I reported this case, I did emphasize this to the police officers. And the umbrella he put back on the rack has this characteristic too.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant does show his regret and he apologizes sincerely. Would you consider forgiving him? Since it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by it’s just an umbrella? It’s an immoral thing. If he did not return the umbrella back, then I would have to get wet in the rain.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。

zh-TW	那天我和同學一起去看鶯歌陶瓷博物館的展覽。當我們看完那些物品之後，他們說覺得很餓，想要買食物來吃，所以我們想找個地方用晚餐。當我離開的時候，卻發現已經在下雨了。然後我沒有帶雨傘，所以我想跟同學借一把，我想要和我一位叫做Adam的朋友借雨傘，他的身型跟我的很像。所以我從架上拿一把傘然後跑去找我的教授跟朋友。當我回去的時候，陳小姐就在那裡。

en-US	If the defendant shows his regretness and he is willing to apologize to you, would you forgive him? It’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	Mr. Paul Anderson, you are prosecuted for theft. The time of the incident…the date of the incident was May 27th, 2018. At that day, you visit Yingge Ceramics Museum and borrow the plaintiff’s umbrella without telling her. And when you return the umbrella back, you are found by the plaintiff on the spot. And that’s the reason why you are prosecuted. Today we are mainly going to clarify what happened that day, so please answer the questions I ask so the prosecutors can understand what actually happened that day. Understand? Later I will also ask the plaintiff what happened that day. Do both party understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, when were you at 4:15 p.m., on May 27th , 2018.

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我那時候在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see the plaintiff, Ms. Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	有，我把雨傘放回傘架的時候，陳小姐就在那裏。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她對我大叫，說我偷她的傘，我試著解釋我應該是拿錯傘了，我沒有要偷傘。我還試著跟她道歉，但是她不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why would say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和幾個同學到博物館看展覽，看完展覽之後，有些人說他餓了，所以我們決定出去買些吃的，也順便找在哪裡吃晚餐。要離開博物館的時候，我發現下雨了，但是我沒有帶傘，所以我決定要跟同學借一把傘。因為我身形比較高大一點，所以我決定跟我的同學，他叫亞當，我決定跟他借傘，因為他的身形跟我差不多。所以我從傘架上拿了把傘，然後出去買麵包，跟我的教授和兩位朋友一起，而當我走回去傘架的時候，陳小姐就開始對我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean the umbrella you borrowed is from your friend, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我以為那把傘就是亞當的，我並無意偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Then did you remember what color the umbrella you took was?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得它是…我只記得它的顏色，藍色，而且沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	The whole umbrella is blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	我印象中傘是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Does anyone can prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有的，我走出博物館的時候，一位教授和兩位同學都在我旁邊，教授甚至還想借我她的傘，但是教授的傘比較小，所以我沒有跟她借，我不想讓教授淋濕，其他兩位朋友在旁邊也有看到。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So these three people can come to the court and prove what you said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想可以吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any evidence that you want the prosecutor offices to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我當時試著把傘還給陳小姐，她不接受。我試著跟她道歉，她也不聽。我想我的教授和兩位同學應該可以到庭作證我說的都是事實。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok. Next, I am going to ask Ms. Chen about what happened that day. Ms. Chen, can you describe what had happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	That day I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. It was raining, and when I…before I went into the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. However, when I came out, my umbrella is gone. I ask the staff of the museum to look for my umbrella for me. Then I saw this foreigner come back with my umbrella. When I found that he had my umbrella, I was very mad. I ask him angrily why he took my umbrella. It was raining! Didn’t he have any moral ideas?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What was the color of the umbrella you brought that day? Does it have any features?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	It was blue, maybe dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now we are going to display the picture on page 5, investigatory file 1. Is it your umbrella?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is an ordinary one. You can get it in a convenience store. How can you determine that it was your umbrella.

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought it at seven-eleven, but the button of my umbrella is a little broken. When I report the case to the police, I have explained this point. And the umbrella which the foreign returned back to the rack has the same feature. From this, we can know that it was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the defendant regrets it and is willing to apologize, would you forgive him? After all, it was just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by it was just an umbrella? It’s about moral. If he didn’t return the umbrella back, I would have to go home in the heavy rain! I wouldn’t forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Oh…ok. Then the court will subpoena the defendant’s professor and the two friends. The next proceeding is set to be at 3 p.m., June 25th, 2018. The defendant and the three witness should be appear in the court…should appear in the court. Defendant, would this date be ok?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	可以，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The plaintiff, the next proceeding, you can either come or not come. Next time we will mainly ask the defendant and his professor and two classmates, so either you come or not is ok.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	Then I won’t come. I would have to take a day-off if I come.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. Then the court is adjourned. Please sign the court script before you leave.

en-US	The defendant, Paul Anderson, on the time of… at 27th, May, 2018, the location was at Yingge Ceramics Museum in New Taipei City. You are found to take an umbrella without the owner’s permission, and you didn’t inform the accuser, and when you return the umbrella, you were found by the accuser, 陳小倩, that you took away her umbrella, so she decided to sue you.The purpose of today’s procedure is to understand what happened that day, and the judge and the prosecutor will ask you questions to understand what happened that day. Do you understand the procedure?And then later, the court will ask the accuser to describe what happened that day, do the both parties understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	The defendant, where were you at 4:15 pm, on 27th May 2018?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我人在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time, did you see the accuser, Ms. Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，我有看見。當我把傘放回架上的時候，我有看到她。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	Then what happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	那個時候陳小姐大聲地對我叫喊，說我偷了他的傘，但是那個時候我努力地跟他解釋我一定只是拿錯傘了，我並沒有偷他的傘。我試著要跟他解釋，但她不聽我講。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why does Ms. Chen say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那個時候我和我的同學去陶瓷博物館看展覽，那個時候看完展覽的一些東西之後，我的兩個同學就說他們餓了，所以我們決定去外面買東西，我們還想要在外面找個地方吃晚餐。正當我要離開博物館的時候，我發現外面正在下雨，但是我發現我沒有帶傘，然後我就決定我要跟我同學借傘，因為我比較高，看起來比較大隻，所以我決定要跟我的同學艾迪借傘，因為他也比較大隻，跟我的身型比較接近。然後我就從架上拿走了一把傘，然後跟我的一個教授跟兩個同學出去買麵包，當我回來的時候，我就看到陳小姐在對著我大喊。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	So do you mean that the umbrella you took is from your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我拿的那把傘是我同學亞當的，我以為那把傘是他的，我覺得我沒有偷別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember what color the umbrella you took was and what shaper it is?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得他是一把藍色的傘，而且他並不新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella whole blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我印象中，他是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Do you have anyone that can prove what you stated is true?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，當時我出來的時候，我的同學和教授也在我旁邊，當時我的教授還想要借我傘，因為那個教授說他的傘有點小，所以我就拒絕了，我沒有拿，因為我不想要他淋濕，當時我的另外兩個同學也在那邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So those three people can come to the court to prove that what you said is true right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have anything you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我有想要嘗試要還陳小姐傘，但他不肯拿。我也想要嘗試跟陳小姐道歉，但他不接受，我想我的教授和我的同學都能夠說明我說的是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok so next I’m going ask Ms. Chen some questions. Ms. Chen, could you please describe the situation that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum, and I found that it was raining outside. When I get into the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack. And then when I came out of the museum, I found that my umbrella disappeared. I ask the staff of the museum help me to find my umbrella, but when I went out of the museum, I found that there was a foreigner putting my umbrella back.When I found that it is the foreigner that took away my umbrella, I was mad. And then I questioned him, didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How can a person so immoral?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What is the color of your umbrella you bring that day? And is there anything special on your umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I bring that day was blue. And it was deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	I’m going to show you the investigatory file, the picture on page five. Ms. Chen, please check if it is your umbrella.

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is very ordinary. It is the kind of umbrella that you can buy in 7-11. How can you be sure that it is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, my umbrella was bought at 7-11. But there is a characteristics on my umbrella. My button on my umbrella didn’t work very well. It can’t really fix on the umbrella. About this point, I explained to the police. When that foreigner putting back the umbrella on the rack, I found that the umbrella he took also has same characteristics as my umbrella. So I can sure that that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Ms. Chen, if the defendant have the sincerity of regression, and he is willing to apologize to you, then would you accept his apology? After all, it is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it is an umbrella? I think that it is about a person’s basic moral. If I didn’t have a umbrella that day, that means I’m going to be wet on that big raining day. I don’t want to accept his apology.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Oh ok, I see. So next the court will send subpoenas to the three people and ask them to be on the court to explain what happened that day. The date of next court is set at 3pm, June 25th, 2018. The defendant and the three people have to be on the court. The defendant, is the date okay for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我可以到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The accuser, Ms. Chen, you don’t have to be on the next court, but if you want to come, that is okay too. Because the main purpose of next court is to ask the classmates and the professor of the defendant to ask them what happened that day.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I won’t be here. Because I would have to take one day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I see. Today’s court is adjourned. Please sign the court script and you can leave.

When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天，我去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展覽，然後看完展覽之後，我跟我兩個同行的朋友就說肚子很餓，想要出去找一些食物吃，但是當我們要走出博物館的時候，才發現突然下雨了，但是我身上又沒有帶傘，然後打算向我朋友借一把，因為我身材比較高大，所以我決定跟我朋友亞當借傘，因為他身形跟我類似，於是，我就從傘架上拿了那一支傘，然後想說待會買一點東西，馬上就歸還，當我回到現場的時候，陳小姐就對著我吼叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	So, do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed at that time was your classmate’s, Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我以為我當時借的傘就是亞當的，我根本並沒有想要去拿別人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember what was the color and the shape of the umbrella you borrowed that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，它是藍色的，蠻舊的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象當中，它是藍色的沒錯。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is anyone can prove your words you just said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，當那天走出來的時候，教授和其他兩個同學都在場，教授甚至說要借我傘，但是那把傘好像太小了，所以我就跟她講，可能要向另外一個同學借傘。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, the three people can be court to prove what you just said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	是的。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	So, do you have any evidence you want the police to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我想要把傘還給陳小姐，但是她都不接受，我也想誠心地跟她道歉，但是她也都不聽，我想我的教授跟其他兩位同學應該能替我作證吧。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK, now I am going to ask some details to Ms. Chen on that day.Ms. Chen, could you elaborate what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	That day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. However, it was rainy. So, when I entered the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack. However, when I wanted to leave, I found my umbrella gone. I asked the museum staff to help me, at the same time, I found the foreign turn my umbrella back. When I realized that the umbrella he took was my umbrella, I was really angry. Did he know it was rainy? So, how could he take my umbrella away?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What’s the color or other features of the umbrella you brought that day?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day might be blue, I think it’s dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Show the evidence 1, page 5. In the picture, is your umbrella?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is very common. It can be found in every convenience store. How could you make sure the umbrella is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, I bought my umbrella in 7-11 convenience store. However, the button of my umbrella is kind of broken. So, I can make sure that’s my umbrella. At that time, I said to the police, and the umbrella the foreign turned back the button of the umbrella was also broken. So, I can make sure he stole my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the other party has regrets and also is willing to apologize, are you willing to forgive him? After all, what you lost is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it’s just an umbrella? It’s a matter of our values and moral. On that day, if he didn’t turn back my umbrella, so do you want me to go home without umbrella? I didn’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Oh, I understand. So, the court will subpoena the three witnesses. And the next court is set on 6/25 in 2018. The time is 3:00 P.M. The defendant and the three witnesses should be court. The defendant, do you understand the procedure? And the time is OK for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會準時出席的。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Ms. Chen, you can be next court or not be next court. In the next proceeding, we will ask the three witnesses, including the professor and other classmates.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	I won’t be here. If I am here, I need to take another day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. So, the procedure is dismissed. Please sign on the court script before leave, thanks.

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time, did you see the accuser, Ms. Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，當我把雨傘還回架上後，陳小姐就在那邊了。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened then?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她站在那邊對我大叫，說我偷了她的傘，我告訴她我只是不小心拿錯而已。我沒有偷。我試著向她道歉，但她不接受。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did Ms. Chen say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和我同學一起去博物官參觀一個展覽，看完展覽後我們感到有些餓，所以我們就決定去買食物，甚至是去尋覓晚餐。當我要離開博物館的時候，我發現外面正在下雨，所以我就決定向我同學借一把雨傘。因為我有點高，所以我就像我同學一位叫亞當斯的借，因為他的身型和體型都和我很像。我從架上拿了一把雨傘和教授和兩位朋友去買了麵包。當我買回來的時候，陳小姐就對我大叫了。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed then was from your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的。我以為當時那把傘是我同學亞當斯的。我並沒有意圖要偷那個傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Could you recall the color of the umbrella you took then?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色而已。是藍色的然後沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the umbrella all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我印象中是藍色的沒錯。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone proof what you just said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，可以。當時我和我的教授和兩位朋友離開博物館時，我教授甚至還問我要不要借我雨傘，因為她雨傘太小，我就不打算跟她借了。我不想要她淋濕。我那兩位同學當時也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	I assume that the three of them can come to the court and clarify your statement, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any evidence you wish the court to investigate on your behalf?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我當時試著還給她雨傘，她不收。我跟她道歉，她也不接受。我想我的教授們跟兩位同學都能幫我做證這點。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	I see. Now I’m going to ask Ms. Chen what happened that day.Ms. Chen, can you tell me what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day. It was raining outside. So when I enterd the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack, and then I found out it was gone. I asked the members of the museum to help me find my umbrella. I found out that this foreigner took my umbrella. I realized the umbrella he was taking is the one I lost. I was very angry. How could anyone do such thing when they know it was raining outside?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Ms. Chen what is the color and the feature of your umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	My umbrella was dark blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Page 5 of the investigatory file… the evidence used in the case, is the umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that was my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on that photo was a very common one. It was an umbrella anyone can get at 7-11. How can you proof that it was your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, it was brought from 7-11. My umbrella is kind of broken because the button of the umbrella doesn’t work well. I told the police this feature of my umbrella. And when the foreigner put back the umbrella, that umbrella did has this kind of feature.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the other party is willing to apologize and he is regretful, will you forgive him? Since it was only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it was only an umbrella? It was something about integrity. If he didn’t bring back my umbrella, I have to walk back to my home without an umbrella.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Oh… okay, I see. I will subpoena his professor and two of his friends to the court. The next proceeding will be at 3pm June 25th. The defendant, do you understand?

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No. I am not going to come. I don’t want to take a leave.

When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那時候我跟我同學一起去參觀鶯歌陶瓷博物館的展覽。當我們看到了某兩件東西的時候，我的同學就說他有點餓，想吃點東西，所以我們就去外面尋找可以吃晚餐的地方。當我在博物館的時候，外面下著大雨，我當時就想說先跟我同學借把傘好了。因為我的體型比較高壯，那我就想說我的同學Adam身形也是這樣，所以我決定借了他的傘。當時我就拿了架上Adam的傘去買了麵包給我的教授和同學。當我回來的時候，陳小姐看到我就馬上大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	The defendant, do you mean that you borrowed Adam’s umbrella at that time, is that right?

zh-TW	是的，可以證明我的言詞的就是我的教授和同學，當時我和教授和同學一起出去買東西，然後教授也想借我傘。因為她的傘比較舊，所以我就沒有拿她的傘。當時我的教授和同學也都知道。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella is very ordinary and it may be bought in the 711 convenient store on that photo. How can you say that this is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, this umbrella was bought in the 711 convenient store and the button of the umbrella has some problems.When I report the incident to the police, I emphasized that feature…… and the foreigner did take the umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	The plaintiff, if the defendant has the regret and sincerely apologizes to you, could you forgive the foreigner? Because it was not a big deal, right?

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	This umbrella is not ordinary. If I just the foreigner, in other words, it means that at that day I have to undertook the rain, so I don’t want to forgive the person?

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Ok, we will subpoena the three people to come to the court at 3 p.m. on 6/25 and the defendant and other witness should come to the court. Is that date, Ok, the defendant?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我可以。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, you can come to the court or not to come to here at the nest proceeding. In that day, I just want to ask the professor and classmates about the process of the incident.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I will not come to the court next time.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. This is the end of the procedure. Today’s procedure is adjourned and please both parties stay to write the court script.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The time was at May 27, 2018. The incident happened at Yingge Ceramics Museum in New Taipei city. You took Hsiao-Chien Chen’s umbrella without her permission. You were caught by her with her spot, and thus she pressed charges. Today’s procedure is mainly to understand what happened that day. Answer my questions so that we can understand the details of the incident. Do you understand? Later I’ll also ask the accuser about what happened that day. Do both understand the procedure?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	 I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	Defendant, where were you at 4:15 pm. At May 27th 2018?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我在鶯歌陶瓷博物館。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	Did you see Ms. Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，我把傘放回傘架的時候，就看到她了。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	And what happened then?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對我大叫，說我偷了她的傘。我試著跟她說我拿錯傘了，並不是要偷，試著跟她道歉但她都不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	And why Ms. Chen said you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和幾個同學參觀博物館展覽，看完展覽之後，兩個同學說他餓了，所以就決定出去買東西，或許也找個地方晚餐。當我離開博物館，我發現外面下雨，但沒帶傘，所以想要跟同學借一把。因為我個頭較大，所以我決定去跟我一個朋友亞當借傘。他身形跟我差不多，後來我從傘架拿了傘，和我的教授和幾個朋友去買一些麵包。當我回來的時候，陳小姐就開始對我吼叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	You mean the umbrella you borrowed was Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我以為我拿的傘是亞當的，我並沒有要偷傘的意思。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you took?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，是藍色，不是全新的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is it all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	我印象中是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Is there anyone who can prove what you said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，我走出博物館的時候，教授和其他兩個同學都和我在一起，我的教授甚至借我她的傘。因為她的傘太小了，我沒辦法撐，又不想要她被淋溼。另外兩個同學也在那裏。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So those three people could help you to prove what you just said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	What any else evidence do you hope the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著還陳小姐傘但她不要，跟她道歉她也不聽，也許我的教授和朋友可以證明我今天說的都是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK, now I would like to ask Ms. Chen about the details of the incident.Ms. Chen, could you describe what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge museum. It was rainy. When I entered it, I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I came out, it was gone.I asked the staff to help me find it. Then I saw the foreigner take it back.When I discovered the umbrella he took was mine, I felt angry and asked him why he took my umbrella. Didn’t he know it was rainy outside? How can somebody be so selfish?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What color was the umbrella you took? Is there anything special on it?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	What I took was blue. I think it was deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Picture on the page 5of exhibit 1, is that umbrella yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it is.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella is the ordinary one. That can be bought at 7-11. How could you be sure that umbrella is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Yes, that was bought at 7-11, but the button on my umbrella is a little bit damaged, a little bit hard to buckle it up.About this point, I have specially explained to the police. The umbrella that the foreigner took back had this feature. Therefore, I am sure that’s mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Then I ask you, if the other party shows regrets and is willing to apologize, will you forgive him? After all, that is only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean “only an umbrella?” that is a basic moral problem. Had he not returned the umbrella, I would have to walk home in the pouring rain? I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	OK, I see. We will subpoena the three witnesses just mentioned to ask them about what happened that day. The next court is set at 3 pm. on June 25th, 2018. The defendant and the three witnesses should be here. The defendant, is that date OK with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	好的，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Ms. Chen. The next court you can choose to be here or not. Basically people whom we’ll ask are the classmates and the professor who were with the defendant that day. If you would like to come, welcome.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	It’s not necessary. I don’t want to ask another day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	The defendant, the accuser, Miss Chen, she said the incident happened on May 27th, 2018 and the situation is that you took her umbrella and did not inform her (you took her umbrella without notification… of her) so when you returned the umbrella back, she caught you immediately, and so she reported the case to the police and then filed the lawsuit. So, today, the procedure will focus on what you did that day, and the defendant, we need you to tell us what happened on that day and answer our questions, do you understand?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，當我把雨傘放回架子上，我就看到她了。

zh-TW	她對著我大吼、大聲喊叫，說我是小偷，偷了她的傘，但我想我一定是拿錯把了。我有試圖道歉，但她不接受。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry.

His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天，我和我同學一起去博物館看展，當我們看完所有的展品時，我有兩…我其中兩個同學覺得很餓，所以我們決定找個地方吃晚餐。當我們要離開時，外面下雨了，可是我剛好沒有帶雨傘，所以我想跟我同學借傘。因為我身材比較高大，所以我向我其中一位同學，亞當，借傘，他的身形跟我比較像。於是我就從架子上 借 了一把傘，然後和我的教授跟我同學一起去買食物這樣，當我們回來後，陳小姐就對著我們大吼。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Are you saying that the umbrella you borrowed was… did it belong to your classmate, Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對阿，我以為那把傘是亞當的傘啊。我真的沒有有意要去偷人家的東西。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember what… the shape and the color of the umbrella… you took?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色是藍色而已，而且不是很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Was the umbrella all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我印象中，應該是，沒錯。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Could anyone prove your word?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	我想，有。當我們走出博物館時，我的教授跟我的兩個同學和我一起走的，我的教授甚至借了我她的傘。因為教授的傘比較小把一點，但我也不想讓教授淋濕，所以我就沒有借了。當時另外兩個同學也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So, can the three people come to the court to verify your word?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	應該可以吧。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我有試著把雨傘還給陳小姐，也有試圖向她道歉，可是她都不肯接受。我想我同行的那三人可以幫我佐證我的話，告知整個事發的經過。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Well, I see. Then, now the court is going to ask Miss Chen what happened on that day.Miss Chen, could you tell us what happened on that day?

I ask for help from the faculty of the museum, and after that, I saw this guy put my umbrella back into the rack. When I found that it was… this guy took the umbrella that I thought was stolen, I questioned him… You didn’t know there was rain outside? Are you crazy? ......

en-US	The umbrella in the picture, it is the kind that we can buy from a convenience store. It’s really common. How can you recognize that it is your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	It is true I bought the umbrella at a convenience store. And… there is something different with my umbrella. A button was broken. It can’t match… I told the police about the button things, and so… I found that this guy return the same umbrella with the same button problem, so I knew it was him stole my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Well, if the other party has the sense… if the other party will apologize with regrets, can you forgive him? It was just only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	An umbrella? What do you mean “an umbrella”? Do you know how the situation is completely out of control of moral? It was a rainy day. Heavy rain. Do you know the situation?

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	Mr. Paul Anderson, on May 27th, 2018, you visit the Yingge Ceramic Meseum, and you took the plaintiff, Xiaoqian Chen’s umbrella without notifying her. And…and when you tried to return the umbrella, she found the…she found your action. Therefore, she file a law suit against you.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	The defendant, where were you at 4:15 p.m. on May 17th, 2018?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我當時在鶯歌陶瓷博物館

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time, did you see the plaintiff, Miss. Xiaoqian Chen.

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，當我把雨傘放回架上的時候，我有看到她。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	Then what happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她大叫著說我偷了她的雨傘，我也嘗試跟她講說我並沒要偷他的傘，我只是拿錯傘了。我試著跟她道歉，但她不聽。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Then why Miss. Chen said that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天，我跟幾個同學一起去博物館參觀一個展覽，到一半的時候，我同學突然說肚子餓了，所以我們決定出去買點東西，也許順便會吃個晚餐。當我們走出博物館的時候，我們發現外面在下雨，我沒有帶傘，所以當時想說要借我其中一個同學的傘。因為我比較高大，所以我想說借跟我差不多身型的艾登的傘，他的傘跟我的很像。然後我就帶著那個傘，還有我的教授跟兩個朋友一起去買東西，當我買了麵包回來的時候，就遇到了陳小姐，她就開始對著我大叫

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Well do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed is your classmate’s, Adam’s?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我當時以為那把傘是我朋友的，我並沒有想要去偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Did you remember the color and the shape of the umbrella you borrowed at…on that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色，是藍色的，而且並不是新的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella fully blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象中，它是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone back up your words?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，當時我離開博物館的時候有我的教授跟兩位同學跟我同行，其中我的教授甚至還說要救我他的傘。但是因為他的傘對我來講太小了，我不想要淋濕，所以就婉拒了，當時我另外兩個同學也在場。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	So the three people you mentioned they can come to the court and support what you said, right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想是的

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	What else do you want the investigator…the prosecutor to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我試著要還陳小姐傘。但他不要；我也有試著跟她道歉，但她也不應。也許我的教授跟兩位同學能夠來佐證我今天所說的話都是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Ok. Now I am going to ask Miss. Chen what happened on that day. Miss. Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to the Yingge Ceramics Museum on that day. It was rainy. And when I…when I was leaving the museum I…when I went into the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I was leaving the museum, I found my umbrella was lost I asked the staff in the museum for help, and at that time, I saw the foreigner tried to return my umbrella to the rack. When I found that the umbrella he took was the one that I lost, I was very angry. Didn’t she know…didn’t he know that the outside was rainy? How can he do that?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What color was the umbrella you took on that day? And can you say anything specific?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took on that day was blue. I think it was deep blue.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Investigatory file 1, page 5. Is the umbrella…the…is the picture’s umbrella…is the umbrella in the picture the one that you lost?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on the picture was very ordinary. And maybe you can buy…buy anything…any umbrella like this in 7-11. How can you certainly say that it was yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought my umbrella in 7-11. But the bottom of my umbrella was a little bit broken, so I can…so I am sure that was my umbrella. When I reported to the police, I …I no…I mentioned this point. The umbrella like the foreigners returned to the rack, I found this on that umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	If the other party was regret and he was…is willing to apologize to you, will you pardon him? After all, it was only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean that it was just an umbrella? It was the…the problem about his personality. If he didn’t return the umbrella, I will get wet and I couldn’t…I couldn’t go home. I do not want to pardon him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Ok, I understand. I will send the paper to the other …to the other three persons. And our next court will be set at 3 p.m. on June 25th, 2018. And the defendant and the three witness will be here. The defendant, is the date of our next court ok with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我能來。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss. Chen, you can be here on our next court. You can come or…or you don’t want to come, it’s up to you. Our next court will mainly focus on Asking what happened on that day…ask the other witness, the professor and classmates. But if you want to come, that’s fine.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I don’t want to take a day off on my work.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，我要把我的雨傘放回架上的時候，陳小倩在那裏。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	他對著我吼說我偷了他的雨傘，我試著告訴他我並沒有要偷他的雨傘，我應該只是不小心拿錯了。我試著向他道歉，但他聽不進去。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why would she accuse you of stealing her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我跟同學去博物館看展覽，我們看完後，我其中兩個同學說他們餓了，我們就決定外出覓食，順便尋找晚餐要在哪裡吃。在我要離開的時候我發現下雨了，因為我沒有帶雨傘，所以我打算借一支我同學的雨傘。因為我比較高大，所以我決定借我同學亞當的傘，因為他跟我體型一致。然後我就從架上拿了一支傘，跟教授和同學去買了一些麵包，當我回來時，陳小姐就開始對我吼叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	The umbrella that you took belonged to your classmate, Adam. Is that what you’re saying?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	對，我當時以為我拿了亞當的傘，我並沒有想要偷任何人的傘。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the shape or the color that you took at that time?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只記得顏色。那是一支藍色的傘，並沒有很新。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the whole umbrella blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象中，那支傘是藍色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can someone verify your statements?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	有的，在我離開博物館的時候，我的教授和兩名同學都跟著我離開，我的教授甚至有提說要不要借我他的傘。但因為他的傘比較小，所以我就沒有借，因為我不想要他也被雨淋濕，當時另外兩位同學也都在旁邊。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	I assume that those three people can come to the court to verify your statement. Is that right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想應該可以。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Do you have any further evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我當時試著要還陳小姐她的傘，但是他不願意拿。我當時也試著跟他道歉了，但是他也不接受。也許我的教授跟同學到庭後，可以幫助證明我的說詞是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	I see. Now let’s move on to Ms. Chen. I am going to ask you some questions regarding the incident happened on that day. Ms. Chen, can you describe what happened on that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum that day. It was raining. When I entered the museum, I put my umbrella in the rack outside. But when I got out of the museum, the umbrella was gone. I asked the staff members in the museum to help me find my umbrella. Afterwards, I saw this foreigner coming back with MY umbrella. When I realized that he was holding my umbrella, I was very angry. So I asked him, “Why did you take my umbrella? Didn’t you know that it was raining outside? How can someone be so impolite?”

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What was the color of the umbrella that your brought on that day? Were there any features? 

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The color was blue. It was probably a dark blue umbrella.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Show exhibit number one. Please look at page number five. Is the umbrella on this picture yours?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that’s the one.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in this picture is a very regular umbrella. It’s the kind of umbrella that you can buy at any 7-11 convenience store. How can you be so sure that it’s your umbrella?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	It’s true that I bought my umbrella in 7-11. However, my umbrella has some damage in the button area. I told the police about this feature when I was filing for this case. And the umbrella that the foreigner put back to the rack has the same features. Therefore, I can be sure that it’s my umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	So, can you forgive him after he showed regrets? Because, at the end of the day, it’s just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it’s JUST an umbrella? This is a question of basic morals. What if he didn’t bring back the umbrella that I had to go home in the rain? I do not want to forgive him AT ALL!

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I see. The court will subpoena the three witnesses that the accused mentioned. The next proceeding is set at 3 PM, on June 25th, 2018. The three witnesses and the accused should all be here on that day. The accused, is this date okay with you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The accuser, you can choose to be here or not for the next proceeding. Basically, we’ll be asking question to the three witnesses that the accused mentioned. You can be here if you want. Do you understand?

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	That won’t be necessary. I do not want to take another day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. This is the end of today’s proceeding. Please leave after you sign the court script.

zh-TW	那天我跟我的同學是到鶯歌博物館鶯歌陶瓷博物館去參加一場展覽，當展覽看完之後，其中一位同學說肚子有點餓了，所以我們就打算去找一些東西吃，或許找一些東西當作晚餐。當我要走出鶯歌陶瓷博物館時，外面下雨了，我沒有帶我的傘，所以我就想說要從我朋友那邊借一支。因為我長得比較強壯一點，所以我就想說要從我的朋友艾登那邊借一支傘，因為他的身形跟我比較相似。所以我就從架上拿出拿走了一把傘，然後跟我的兩位朋友跟教授一起去吃午一起去買晚餐，當我們回來時，我就看到陳小姐在那邊對者我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?

zh-TW	那天我和我的同學去鶯歌陶瓷博物館看展，我們看完展後，我們都覺得很餓，就決定出去買些食物。當我要離開博物館時，我發現外面正在下雨，而我並沒有帶傘，於是我就想跟我的一位同學借傘。因為我的個子比較高，身型較大，我就跟我的朋友亞當借傘，他的身形跟我很像。之後我就從傘架拿一支傘，和我的教授以及其他同學去買些麵包。當我們回來時，陳小姐看到我拿她的傘就開始對我大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	So the umbrella you borrowed was belonged to your classmate Adam?

zh-TW	有的。當我從博物館出來時，我的教授和其他兩位同學都在。我的教授當時想要借我她的傘，但因為她的傘有點小，而我不想要她被淋濕，就沒有跟她借。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?

zh-TW	我當時試著要還陳小姐她的傘，但她不接受。我試著跟她道歉，她也不聽。也許我的教授和朋友們可以佐證我今天講的話都是真的。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	Now I’m going to ask Miss Chen what happened that day. Miss Chen could you please describe what happened that day?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	That day, I went to Yingge Ceramics Museum. When I enter the museum, I put my umbrella on the rack. However, when I came out, I found that my umbrella was gone. I asked the staffs of the museum to help me find the umbrella. Then, I saw this foreigner took my umbrella. I was angry, so I asked he why did he take my umbrella. Didn’t he know that it was raining outside? How could he do that to me?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	What was the color of the umbrella you brought that day? Was there any characteristic?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I brought that day was blue. Dark blue, maybe.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Now I’m going to show the picture on page 5 of the investigatory file. Is the umbrella in the picture belongs to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, that is my umbrella.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella in the picture is just the ordinary one, the one you can buy from 7-11. How can you be so sure that it is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	Indeed, I bought it from 7-11. However, the button part was a little broken, and the umbrella can’t be closed. When I reported the case to the police, I mentioned this point. The one that the foreigner took had the same feature, so I was sure that it was mine.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Would you like to forgive the other party if he is regretful and willing to apologize? After all, it is just an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean it is just an umbrella? This is an issue of morality. If he didn’t return the umbrella that day, I would have got wet when I went home. I don’t want to forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	I understand. Then, we will subpoena the three witnesses that were mentioned before. We will ask them to come to the court to explain what happened that day. The next court date will be set at 3 pm June 25th 2018. The defendant, is the time okay for you?

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	The accuser, Miss Chen, the next court date you can choose to come or not to come. We will ask some questions to the defendant’s classmates and professor.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I will have to take another day off.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	I understand. The court is rest. Please sign the scrip before you leave.

zh-TW	今為偷竊案件偵字1425號偵查程序
en-US	Today we are here for the investigatory procedure of theft case, case number 2826.

zh-TW	Paul Anderson你因為在103年05月27日造訪新北市鶯歌博物館時，拿了原告陳小倩的雨傘，因為此行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，當你還傘時，當場被陳小倩人、傘具獲，因此她提出告訴。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎? 待會我也會詢問原告，聽聽她陳述當天發生的經過，雙方明白程序嗎?
en-US	The incident happened on May 27th, 2018. And the accused, Paul Anderson is accused of taking away an umbrella of the accuser Chen Xiaoqian. Because the accused didn’t inform the accuser that he took the umbrella, when he returned the umbrella, he was caught. Therefore the accuser decided to file a lawsuit against him. And the location was at Yingge Ceramics Museum. Today’s procedure is to find the reason of this case and let the prosecutor know what happened about the incident. Do you fully understand? Later I will ask the accuser what happened about the incident to fully understand this case. Do both parties understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	我了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	那請問被告103年5月27日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡? 
en-US	The accused, where were you at 4:15pm on May 27th, 2018?

en-US	I was at Yingge Ceramics Museum.
zh-TW	我当时在莺歌陶瓷博物馆。

zh-TW	當時你有看到原告陳小姐嗎?
en-US	At that time did you see the accuser Miss Chen?

en-US	Yes, when I put the umbrella back to the rack, Ms. Chen was there.
zh-TW	是的，当我把雨伞还回去的时候，陈小姐在那里。

zh-TW	當時發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	What happened at that time?

en-US	She yelled at me, saying that I stole her umbrella. I tried to tell her that I must have taken the wrong one. I did not steal her umbrella. I tried to apologize to her, but she wouldn’t listen.
zh-TW	她当时对着我大叫，说我偷了她的伞，我于是向她解释我可能是拿错了伞，并没有偷。我当时也试图给它道歉，但她并不接受。

zh-TW	那為什麼陳小姐會說你偷了她的傘呢? 
en-US	Why did Miss Chen say that you stole her umbrella?

en-US	On that day, some classmates and I visited the Museum for an exhibition. When we finished viewing the exhibited items, two of my classmates said they were hungry. Therefore, we decided to go out and buy some food, perhaps even try to find a place for dinner. When I was leaving the museum, I realized it was raining. I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I planned to borrow one from my classmates. Because I am a bit tall and big, I decided to borrow the umbrella of Adam, a friend of mine. His body shape is similar to mine. Then I took one umbrella from the rack. I went to buy some bread with my professor and two other friends. When we came back, that’s when Ms. Chen started to yell at me.
zh-TW	那天我和同学去了莺歌陶瓷博物馆去看一个展览，看完展品之后，有同学说很饿想去吃东西，于是我们想去找一个吃东西的地方，和找个地方吃晚饭。当我离开博物馆之后，我看到下雨了，但是我并没有带伞，于是我就想说借同学的伞。因为我身材高大，所以我想借亚当的雨伞，因为他身材和我差不多。我从架子上拿了一把雨伞，然后就给教授和同学买面包，当我回来的时候，就发现陈小姐对我大喊大叫。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你當時借的傘是你同學亞當的?
en-US	Do you mean that the umbrella you borrowed is from your classmate Adam?

en-US	Yes, I thought the umbrella I took belonged to Adam. I didn’t intend to steal anyone’s umbrella.
zh-TW	是的，我当时觉得自己拿的是亚当的雨伞，我并没有被想要偷任何人的雨伞。

zh-TW	那你記得你那天拿的那把傘是什麼顏色、什麼形狀嗎? 
en-US	Do you remember the color and shape of the umbrella you borrowed that day?

en-US	I only remember the color. It was blue, not a brand new one.
zh-TW	我只记得雨伞的颜色。它是蓝色的，然后并不是崭新的。

zh-TW	那支傘整隻都是藍色的嗎?
en-US	Is the umbrella all blue?

en-US	In my recollection, the color was blue.
zh-TW	在我的印象当中，那个伞是蓝色的。

zh-TW	有人可以證明你剛剛講的話嗎?
en-US	Can anyone verify what your said?

en-US	Yes, when I came out from the museum, my professor and other two classmates were with me. My professor even offered to lend me her umbrella; since her umbrella was quite small, I didn’t take it. I didn’t want her to get wet. The other two classmates were there too.
zh-TW	是的，当我离开博物馆的时候，我和一个教授和两个同学一起。教授当时甚至要借给我她自己的伞。因为她的伞太小了，我不想身上淋湿，所以没要她的伞，当时两个同学也在那里。

zh-TW	那他們三位應該能夠到庭幫你佐證剛剛所說的話，對吧?
en-US	Do you mean that all three of them can be present at the court and verify what you said, am I right?

en-US	I guess so.
zh-TW	我想应该是这样。

zh-TW	那你還有什麼希望檢方幫你調查的證據呢?
en-US	Is there any evidence you want the police to help investigate for you?

en-US	I tried to return Ms. Chen her umbrella but she wouldn’t take it. I tried to apologize to her but she wouldn’t listen to me, either. Perhaps my professor and my friends will be able to prove what I have said today is the truth.
zh-TW	我试图把伞归还给陈小姐，但她不要，我也试图给她道歉，但她也不接受，也许我的教授和同学能证实我说的是真的吧。

zh-TW	好的，那我現在要詢問陳小姐，當天案發的經過。陳小姐，能否請你講述一下當天發生了什麼事。
en-US	OK, let me ask you a few questions on what happened about the incident?Miss Chen, can you tell us what happened at that time on this incident?

zh-TW	我那天去鶯歌博物館，當時在下雨，我在進館時，把雨傘放在外面的傘架上，可是當我出來時，傘不見了，我請館方人員幫我找，後來就看到這個外國人把傘拿回來放，當我發現他拿的傘就是我失竊的傘時，我很生氣，有質問他為何要拿我的傘? 難道不知道外面在下雨嗎?怎麼會有人那麼沒有公德心呢?
en-US	It was raining when I was going to the Yingge Ceramics Museum. And I put my umbrella on the rack, but when I was about to leave the museum, the umbrella was gone. I asked the staff from the museum to help me find the umbrella and I found that this foreigner returned the umbrella. I was quite angry the umbrella he returned was exactly the one that I have. I asked him why did he take my umbrella. How could he be so ethically irresponsible?

zh-TW	請問你那天帶的傘是什麼顏色的? 有什麼特徵?
en-US	Miss Chen, what’s the color of your umbrella? Are there any characteristics of your umbrella?

zh-TW	我當天帶的傘是藍色的，應該是深藍色的。
en-US	The umbrella I took that day was blue, dark blue I guess.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(1)第5頁的照片，請問照片中的傘是妳的嗎?
en-US	Exhibit evidence one, page five. Does the umbrella on the photo belongs to you?

zh-TW	對，就是這把傘。
en-US	Yes, it belongs to me.

zh-TW	照片中這把傘是很普通的那種，就是7-11可以買到的那種，妳怎麼確定那把傘是妳的呢?
en-US	The umbrella on the photo was quite ordinary that can even be bought everywhere like 711. How can you be so sure that the umbrella on the photo is yours?

zh-TW	的確，我的傘當初就是在7-11買的，但是我的傘在釦子那邊有點損壞，扣不太起來，這點我當初報案時有特別跟警察解釋過，外國人後來放回傘架上的那把，也有這個特徵，由此可知，是我的傘。
en-US	It is indeed bought at a 711-convenience store. But my umbrella has some problems with its buttons and it can’t be fixed. I explained to the police about this matter and the umbrella the foreigner returned on the rack also has problems with its buttons. So I think it’s exactly the same umbrella.

zh-TW	那請問你，如果對方有悔意，也願意道歉，妳有沒有可能原諒他呢? 畢竟失竊的只是一把傘。
en-US	Would you forgive him after he apologizes to you and show his regrets? After all it’s only an umbrella.

zh-TW	什麼叫做「只是」一把傘? 這是一個人有沒有基本道德的問題，如果當天他沒有拿來還，難道要我淋大雨回家嗎? 我不想原諒他。
en-US	What do you mean by just an umbrella. It’s a matter about moral qualities. If he did not return my umbrella, I would go in the rain and go home. I would not forgive him.

zh-TW	我了解了，那麼我們會發傳票給被告剛剛提到的三位人士，請他們到庭說明當天事發的經過。下次庭訊定為103年6月19日下午3點，被告和三位證人都應到庭，被告，這個日期你可以嗎?
en-US	Ok, I understand. This court will subpoena three witnesses to the court. And the next proceeding will be at 3pm, June 25th, 2018. And the three witnesses shall be at the court for the proceeding. Are you ok with this date? 

en-US	Yes, I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我會到庭。

zh-TW	原告陳小姐，下次的庭你可以到、也可以不到，基本上我們要問的是當天跟被告在一起的同學及老師，但如果你要來，也是可以的。
en-US	Miss Chen, for the next proceeding, you can either come or not because the next proceeding is mainly to ask questions to the professors and students. It’s okay for you to come to the court.

zh-TW	不用了，這樣我還要請假。
en-US	No, I will not be present at the next proceeding because I have to ask for a leave permit.

zh-TW	我明白了，那今天的庭訊到此為止，請在簽完筆錄後離席。
en-US	Ok, I understand. This court is dismissed. Please sign the court script and then leave.

zh-TW	(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?
en-US	On the page five, please check the picture. Is it the cap that you took?

en-US	Yes, it is that cap.
zh-TW	喔，是的，是這頂。

zh-TW	然後呢? 發生了什麼事? 
en-US	Then? What happened?

en-US	Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
zh-TW	因為旁邊沒有人，所以我就拿了。

zh-TW	你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?
en-US	So you did take that cap?

en-US	Yes, I did.
zh-TW	是的，我拿的。

zh-TW	你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?
en-US	So don't you know that this cap belongs to someone else that you cannot take it!

en-US	I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
zh-TW	我很抱歉我拿走了這頂帽子，我想還回去，但沒有辦法，我今天把這頂帽子帶來了。

zh-TW	所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎? 
en-US	So I want to make sure the whole process again.So that they said it happened in a parking lot, and there is no one around, so you took that cap, right? 

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened.
zh-TW	是的，這就是事情的經過。

zh-TW	因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?
en-US	So the… the… has raised the case. Do you want to apologize?

en-US	I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me.

zh-TW	Abus Gashion先生，你102年09月15日在桃園中正國際機場停車場，拿了機車車牌KB405上的一頂男用帽子，之後經受害者報案、警方調閱停車場的監視器紀錄，經身分確認後，了解該行為是你所為。由於該行為發生在未告知原告的情況下，又經受害者提出告訴，你涉嫌犯竊盜罪。今天的程序主要是要了解那天發生了什麼事情，請就我提出的問題，加以回答，以便檢方了解當天的事發經過，了解嗎?
en-US	So, you had taken the helmet at the parking lot in Taoyuan International Airport. And the helmet is belong… belongs to the motorcycle which has the number is(of?) KB485.(記錯了) You did that behavior on September, 15th. And the victim went to the police. The police checked the recording and think that you had did that. Without the permission and the victim had gone to the police, so you had violent(violated) the theft. Today what we’re doing is want to know what had happened that day. Please answer the question(s) below to let me know the… what’s happening that day.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	那請問102年9月15日下午4點15分時，你人在哪裡?
en-US	So where were you at four fifteen on September 15th?

en-US	I was at CKS International Airport.
zh-TW	我當時在桃園機場。

zh-TW	你當時去機場做什麼呢??
en-US	Why did you go to the airport?

en-US	I went there to pick up a friend who came to Taiwan for a visit.
zh-TW	我去那邊接來台灣旅遊的朋友。

zh-TW	所以你是去了航廈接人嗎?
en-US	So you said that you had…you just go there to pick up a friend at the terminal.

en-US	Yes, I took a bus to get to the airport. I got there early and I waited for my friend.
zh-TW	對，我是搭客運去那裡的，但是我早到了，所以我在那邊等了一下我朋友。

zh-TW	那為什麼後來會發生你拿原告帽子這件事呢?
en-US	So why did the thing happen (like) that you took other’s helmet?

en-US	I was waiting for my friend but his flight was delayed. I got bored and went around to kill time.
zh-TW	因為我朋友的班機延誤了，然後當時為了打發時間所以我就到處繞繞來殺時間。

zh-TW	你後來去了哪裡呢?
en-US	So where did you go later?

en-US	I went to the parking lot for motorcycles.
zh-TW	我去了摩托車的停車場。

zh-TW	然後發生了什麼事呢?
en-US	So… what happened?

en-US	I saw a cap left on one motorcycle.
zh-TW	我看到有一頂帽子遺落在機車座椅上。

zh-TW	(提示偵卷第五頁之照片)請問是照片中這頂帽子嗎?
en-US	Please see the picture five. Is that cap actually this hat?

en-US	Yes, it is that cap.
zh-TW	對，就是那頂帽子。

zh-TW	然後呢? 發生了什麼事? 
en-US	So what happened later?

en-US	Because there was no one around, I took the cap.
zh-TW	因為當時四下無人，所以我就把帽子拿走了。

zh-TW	你是說你就拿了那頂帽子?
en-US	Did you say that you just took away other’s hat?

en-US	Yes, I did.
zh-TW	對，是我做的。

zh-TW	你難道不知道那頂帽子是別人的，你不可以隨便拿走嗎?
en-US	Don’t you know that cap belong(s) to other? You can’t do that.

en-US	I am sorry for what I did. I tried to return the cap to the owner. I brought it here with me today.
zh-TW	 我很抱歉我所做過的行為，但是我有想要把帽子還給當事人，就像我今天有把帽子帶來。

zh-TW	所以我再跟你確認一次，你那天在機場的機車停車場，看到這頂帽子，因為那時周遭沒人，你就拿了這頂帽子，對嗎? 
en-US	So let me confirm again. At that day, you took this cap at motorcycle parking lot because there is no one seeing. So you just took it, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s what happened.
zh-TW	對，這就是事情發生的經過。

zh-TW	因為現在原告已經提告，那你有意願跟對方道歉、和解嗎?
en-US	 Now the victim had accused you, so do you have the will to solve this problem?

en-US	I tried to apologize to the owner of the cap, but he wouldn’t talk to me. 
zh-TW	我有嘗試向物主道歉但是他不接受。

zh-TW	沒關係，如果你有意願，我們會幫你跟原告進行和解，那先訂103年2月27日早上9點鐘進行調解，你可以到庭嗎? 如果一切順利，可能就會以金錢賠償的方式，結束這個案子，你明白嗎?
en-US	 Don’t mind. If you want to apologize to the victim, we will help you. So we would like to have you to have a meeting with him at nine o’clock on February 27th, 2014. If everything goes well, this case may end up with some money payment. Do you understand?

en-US	I understand and I will be here.
zh-TW	是的，我了解了。我一定會出席的。

zh-TW	好，那我們會通知原告，如果日期不能配合，我們會再通知你，可以嗎? 如果沒有問題，就請你那天準時到本棟四樓的調解室，明白嗎?
en-US	So we will let the victim know the date. And if he cannot show up, we would let you know. Is this okay? No other questions, please show up (on) that day at fourth floor. Do you understand?

en-US	Thank you. I will be there on time.
zh-TW	是的，謝謝。我了解了，我會準時出席的。

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today we are here for the child rearing case between Ferry Johnson and Tasi-yun Shi. Can I ask both sides: do you hire lawyers?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I have a lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有律師。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today I want to know the two sides’positions with the child rearing case and I would know why each of you think you are the better side to keep this child. Please state the details especially at this point. Besides, I know this case also has divorce ongoing. So I hope the case of verbal attack does not happen.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	I have few questions for the plaintiff. Why do you want to get the child rearing right for the kid? As I know, in Taiwan, you don’t have a full-time job and you are a foreigner. Why do you think you are more capable in the case of child rearing?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望法院能判給我全部的撫養權，我有兩個原因。第一，我的妻子沒有再與我們同住了，我想要看著我的女兒長大。再者，我聽說我的太太與其他男人同居，如果這是真，我很疑惑他是否能給我們的女兒完整的照顧，因此我希望獲得撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	so do you mean because your wife is now going to divorce with you and at the same time she’living with another man and you also suspected her of living with another man. Is it because of this situation so you don’t want to leave your daughter to her, is that right?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對，這些是我主要的顧慮。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	In addition, according to your financial status, if you get the sole custody, what would you do to take care of this child?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在的確是們有全職的工作，但是我有兼職許多工作所以我有固定的收入，我想這些收入應該足以支撐我和女兒的生活。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned now you have several part time jobs. Because these are all part time jobs, can you estimate around how much income you will get every month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我有至少4-5件兼職工作，所以平均一個月我可以賺一萬五千元，有時候如果有接到新的計畫，可能有機會賺更多。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	I have another question, is it possible that when you get the sole custody of your child, you are going to bring your child back to Canada. I will as this question is because even you get the sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you take your daughter back to Canada, this will be seen as you cut the tie of your daughter with the mother. To this argument, what’s your plea?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了，我有居留證而且我也喜歡這裡，目前我對在台灣的生活很滿意，特別是我希望我的女兒可以看到他的父母。我要說的是目前我和我太太正在打離婚官司，我們並不希望彼此切斷與女兒的聯繫。在我們離婚官司進行中，我定期會繼我們女兒的照面給太太看，我甚至還安排時間讓我們三個有時兼聚一聚。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	so do you mean that in the recent future, you have no plan to go back to Canada, is that right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	不，我有可能會回加拿大因為我的母親年紀大了又生病，但即使我回去也不會長久待在那，我甚至不會考慮把女兒帶在身邊。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Now I’m going to ask free questions to the defendant. Currently you are not living your husband any more?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, you have been separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the case of divorcing?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	I guess I filed it two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So you mean far before you filed the case, you hadn’t lived together already.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	What is your living circumstances right now? I mean, who do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son in the first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Oh, you mean your first marriage? So what is your marriage with Ferry Johnson right now?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He’s my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	In the child rearing right that you are fighting for right now is with your second husband and it’s a daughter?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and how old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, was your daughter with you or him?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I moved out my daughter was only two months old so she stayed with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	where is the child right now?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	my daughter is at my husband’s place.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	do you have any agreement between you two? Why did the daughter stay with you in the first place and then move to your husband’s place?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place I just moved out is smaller and my husband’s bigger. In terms of the environment, my husband’s place is better so I leave the daughter to him.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstances don’t change, I mean your living situations, your daughter still better stays at your husband’s place? Why do you want to win the child rearing right?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	It took me ten months to get the child. I couldn’t stand that I cannot see her any more. And my husband is a Canadian and he doesn’t have a full-time job. He may go back to Canada any time. Thus, it means I cannot see my daughter any more. That’s why I’m asking the custody of my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	In terms of your financial status, can you elaborate how would you raise your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	We still have the divorcing case going. I hope after the case of divorce I can live where my husband’s living now, the house. Thus in terms of environment, the house is better for my daughter. As to my financial status, I’ve offered the court a list of my asset. Besides, I have a regular job. I earn at least 40000 a month. I think I have the right to rear my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	So what’s the process going of your divorcing case? Do you know around what time the case will be settled?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not quite sure. This Friday we will go to the court again. I will talk to the judge of the case that we hope to see the result faster.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Let’s say we will arrange social workers to visit both the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s houses and we will take into account the interactions of both sides with the child. The court will consider the report after the visit and make the best decision for the daughter. However, before that, will both sides consider the shared custody? The sahred custody means that the daughter will stay sometimes at the mother’s place and sometimes at father’s place.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	對我個人而言我是不希望共同撫養權，因為我的女兒還太小，他才八個月大，我不希望她在我與太太之間流轉。對於這樣年紀小的孩子來說，我覺得這樣太累，一下子搬到母親的地方、一下子換到我的地方。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	At this point, I agree with my husband. The daughter is too little. She shouldn’t and it’s not suitable in this case.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	So we all arrange the visit of social workers first. After we see the report, we will arrange the next court day to keep the right for both parties to state their rights.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我同意社工人員的探訪。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I don’t have any question here. Thank you.

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today I am here… Today this preparing procedure is for court to understand……and I also want to know why you….both of you think that you have the ability to raise the child. Please elaborate this point.Beside,I….beside I also know you have another case for divorce. So I hope there is no verbal attack in this court . Do you understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	yes,i do

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	First, let me ask some questions.So plaintiff , why do you want to get the custody right?as i know, you don’t have a job in taiwan. and you are also a foreigner. So for the child rearing case, why do you think you have ability to raise your child?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望可以把所有撫養權都判給我，因為我很關心他。第一我老婆已經不再跟我們一起住了，我想要看著我的女兒長大，而且我還聽說我的老婆跟別的男人同居，如果真的是這樣的話我懷疑我老婆沒有能力養活這孩子，所以我要爭取全部的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	what you mean is because your wife have divorce case with you, so she is not live with you,right? and you doubt that she lives with other man. it is because of this situation, you don’t want to give your children to her.

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對，這就是我所關心的。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Other than that, for your financial statement,how do you raise your daughter?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在的確沒有全職的工作。但是我有幾份打工，應該可以提供我所有需要。我想這些收入足以養我和我的女兒。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. since all of them are part-time job, can you estimate your regular income per month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我個人大概有四到五個兼職工作。全部加起來的話，一個月大概可以提供五萬塊的收入。有時候如果我有接到新案子的話，每個月的收入都會更加增加。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	So other than salary, will you bring your daughter to Canada after you got the custody, and you will never come back? I mention this point is that even if you got the sole custody, your wife still have visitation right. If you take your daughter back to Canada, it means that you cut the tie with your daughter and her mother. So what do you think?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了。我已經有居留證，而且我很喜歡這個地方。目前還沒有任何打算離開台灣的計畫。而且我也覺得我的女兒也希望可以見到父母。我想說的是即使我現在在和我老婆打離婚官司，我也沒有打算切斷她和女兒之間的聯繫。在我們打離婚官司的同時，我也常常寄我們女兒的照片給她。我甚至和她達成協議，有時候可以大家一起出來聚聚。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you are not going back to Canada recently, right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	沒有...如果我要回加拿大的話是因為我媽媽又老又生病了。然而，就算我回去加拿大了，我也不會在那裡久留。我也不會考慮把我的女兒帶回去加拿大。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	And now i am going to ask your wife some question.You are not live with your husband now, right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes,we have already separate for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	So when do you seek for divorce?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So you mean that far before…you ….seek divorce, you have already separate for some time.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	Can you tell me your living standard….i mean…who lives with you?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my second son…

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? so ……..

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So the child rearing case we dicuss here is your daughter?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and my daughter is about eight month.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	After you leave your house, your daughter stay with you or hisband.

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When i leave my husband, since my daughter is still small, so the daughter….

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	So where is the child?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now my daughter is with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	 Is there any agreement with you and your hisband?first, your daughter live with you, and now she live with your husband, why?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	After I move out, the  place where we were live is a little bit smaller than my husband’s house. So I think the environment is better for the children, so I give my daughter to my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So if objective condition is not change, you still don’t have….better…so why do you want to get custody of your daughter.

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is my daughter, I cannot bear not to see her in the future. Beside, my husband is canadian, and he don’t have a regular job, and he may lost her job and go back to Canada. in that case, I will never see my daughter.That’ why I want the custody of my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Can you elaborate how do you raise your daughter.

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Since we are still in divorce case. as for the environment, it’s fit for my daughter. as for my finical statement, I have already provide the asset list for the courts other than that I have a regular job, it’s about forty thousand a month.So I think I have ability to take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	May I ask about your divorce case?Do you know when will the result revil?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure. We have another court this week. I want to ask the judge, for the divorce case, I hope the verdict will come out soon.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Ok now we will arrange social workers for the both side. And the evaluation will be about how you take care of your daughter. We will refer the the report and decide what is better for your daughter. and before that,will you both side consider share the custody?As for the share custody, it’s mean that the daughter live with after and mother for sometime.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人來說，我不太喜歡這個提議，因為我的女兒還太小，他也只有八個月大而已。我不想要讓他經歷我跟我老婆這段破碎的關係。對於年紀這麼小的女兒來說，他應該會覺得突然跟爸爸或是媽媽住是一件很奇怪的事情。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	I agree my husband at this point. my daughter is too small, she is not okay for this kind of resolution.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Okay, so we arrange the social worker for evaluation first.After they finish report,we will arrange the court for another day to let both party has chance to elaborate their right.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我沒有問題

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	i am fine, too.

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有請律師

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	In the preparatory procedure today, we want to know your opinions about child rearing. And I also want to know why both of you think you are more suitable for the child. Please elaborate this detail. Also, I know you are dealing with the divorcing case, so I hope both of you won’t have verbal attack, okay?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Now I am going to ask the plaintiff some questions. Plaintiff, why do you fight for the custody of your child? As I know, you don’t have a full time job now, in Taiwan. And also you are a foreigner. Why do you think you are suitable for your child?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望可以把小孩全權判給我有兩個原因 首先我老婆已經不跟我們住在一起了 我想要看著我的小孩長大 而且我聽說我老婆現在跟別的男人住在一起 如果真的是這樣的話 我很懷疑他能不能好好的養育我的小孩 因此我希望有全部的撫養權

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean you and your wife is going a divorcing case, but she no longer lives with you? And you think she lives with another man? Is that the reason why you don’t want her to take care of the child, is that right?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對阿 這是我主要的考量

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	As for your financial status, I mean if you get the custody, what would you do?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在是真的沒有一份全職的工作啦 可是我有很幾份兼職的工作讓我也有正常的收入  我相信我的收入足夠來養我跟我的小孩

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have many part time jobs. They are all part time jobs, so can you make sure how much money can you make per month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均有四到五份兼職工作 平均來說 我一個月有五萬塊 有時候如果有新case的話可能還會賺更多錢

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	And I also want to know if you get the custody of your child, will you go back to Canada and no longer come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask this question is that even you get the custody; your wife still had the visitation right. If you take your child back to your country, it means that you cut the tie between them. What’s your opinion about this?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣住五年了 我有居留證而且我也喜歡這個地方 目前我沒有離開台灣的計畫 而且我認為我女兒有見到父母雙方的權利 我想強調的是 雖然我跟我太太正在辦離婚 可是我完全沒有要切斷他跟我女兒的關係 在打離婚官司的過程中 我也都會固定傳女兒照片給我老婆 我還安排出去的機會讓她跟女兒有相處的時間

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean you don’t have the plain to go back to your country in a short time?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	沒有我可能會回加拿大 因為我媽已經老了而且在生病 可是就算我回去也不會待很久 我甚至不會考慮要帶著女兒一起回去

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Okay now I want to ask you some question. So you don’t live with your husband now, right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have lived apart for 6 months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the case of divorce?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	That is, long before you sued for divorce, you don’t lived together.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So who do you live with now?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son from my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? so you and the plaintiff’s marriage is…?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So the custody we are saying now, is your second child, your daughter, right?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	So how old are your son and daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My sun is seven years old now, and my daughter is 8 months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, your daughter lived with you or him?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I moved out, our daughter was only two months old. She still needed lot of cares, so she lived with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Then, presently, who does she live with?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now she lives with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter originally lived you, but now with him?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place I live now is smaller, and the original house I lived with my husband is bigger. Considering about the environment, I think the old house is better for my daughter, so I took her back to live with my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So considering about the objective circumstance, I mean the space of your house, it’s still worse for her, isn’t it? Then why would you want the custody of your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	Come on, I borne her! How would you think I don’t want to see her in the future? Also my husband is a Canadian, and his job is Taiwan is not stable so he may go back to Canada anytime. In that case, doesn’t that mean I can see my daughter anymore? So I want to have the custody of my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Can you tell me how would bring up your child? With your financial status.

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	So far, we are still dealing with the divorcing case. I want to fight for the right to live in the house which my husband lives now, after our divorce. So consider about the environmental issue, the house will suit my daughter a lot. As for my financial status, I have given the court an asset list. Also, I have a regular income; it’s about 40000 per month. So I think I have the ability to take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	So how your divorcing case is goes now? Do you know when will the court’s decision come out?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not very sure about that. We will go to the court this Friday. I will ask the judge of our divorcing case to make the decision as soon.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Okay, then I will sent the social to do to visit both of your houses. And make an evaluation of how you get along with your daughter. And I will take their report into consideration to decide what’s best for the child. Before that, I want to ask both of you, would you consider about sharing shared custody of your daughter? The shared custody goes like that, your daughter will live with you sometime, and the other time lives with your husband.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人不支持這個 因為我女兒還在小了 他只有八個月大耶 我不想要她一直在我跟我老婆之間一直改變環境 對一個這麼小的小孩來說 他會混淆吧 如果他真得要這樣跟我住一段時間又跟她住一段時間

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	I agree with my husband in this. She is too small, it shouldn’t to this way.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Okay, then, I will arrange the social worker to your houses first. After the make the report, we will set the court date to let both of you have a chance to make a statement, is that okay with you?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	好啊 社工要來我可以

zh-TW	台北市士林區忠誠路3段414號5樓
en-US	Fl. 5, No. 414, Sec. 3, Chung Cheng Rd., Shilin Dist., Taipei City.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparation procedure of custody case for Ferry Johnson and Tsai-yun Shih. Do both parties have the lawyer?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes I have the lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有請律師

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	In today’s procedure, I want to know what the idea of both parties in custody is. I also want know why both of you think that you are suitable for getting the custody. Please focus on it as your statement. Besides, you are also having the divorce case. So I want both of you would not have verbal attack to each other.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	At first I will ask some questions to plaintiff. Why you want to get the custody of your child? As I know, you don’t have the full-time job in Taipei. Also, you are a foreigner. In the case of custody, why you strive for rearing your child?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我之所以希望能得到全部的撫養權有兩個原因。首先，我老婆不再與我們住在一起了，我希望能看著我小孩長大。再來，我聽說我老婆現在跟別的男人住在一起，如果真的是那樣的話，我很懷疑我女兒能得到全然的照顧。因此我希望擁有全部的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean you are no longer live together though you are under the case of divorce? Also, you doubt that she is living together with another man. I that circumstances, you don’t want to share the custody with your wife?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的，這是我主要考慮的一些因素。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Otherwise, concerning your financial status, if you get the custody of your daughter, how would you raise your child?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	雖然我現在沒有正職工作是真的，但是我有好幾份兼職工作讓我有固定的收入。我相信這足夠讓我和我女兒過活。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Can you promise that you have regular income?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均會有四到五個兼職，總共來說我大概會有五萬的收入。有時如果有另外的案子我可以有更多的收入。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	I have a further question, is that possible to bring your child to Canada and no more back to Taiwan after you get the custody? The reason why I ask so because even you get sole custody, your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring your child back to Canada, you are separating your wife and child. What’s your idea to this point?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年，我有居留證，而且我也愛這個地方。目前我沒有要離開台灣。另外我也覺得我的女兒有權利可以看到她的爸爸媽媽。雖然我和我老婆正在打離婚官司，我絕對沒有意圖想阻止我女兒與老婆之間的聯繫。在我跟我老婆打離婚官司的過程中，我仍會定期傳女兒的照片給她。我也有鼓勵她多與我們相處。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So recently you don’t plan to back to Canada?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	我有可能會回去加拿大因為我媽媽年老且生病。但就算我回去我也不會待很久。我甚至不會想帶我女兒一起回加拿大。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Okay I have some question to ask the opposite position. Aren’t you living with your husband?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	No, we haven’t lived together for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the divorce suit?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	It might be two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So you didn’t live together before you file the lawsuit, right?.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So what’s your living situation, I mean, who do you live together with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son of my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	The first marriage? What time is the marriage with plaintiff?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is the second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	null

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son? And how old is your daughter.

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out the house, who was your daughter with?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	Because my daughter was only two months old when I was moving out. She needed my care so she was with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Where is daughter with?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	My daughter is with my husband now.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter was first with you and now she is with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place where I am living is smaller than the house when I lived with my husband. I think, environmentally, it is good for my daughter to live with my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So in the objective circumstances, if it isn’t changed, it isn’t good for your daughter to live with you. Why you still want the custody of your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I had ten months pregnant to give birth to her. She is my child. And my husband is a Canadian, also he doesn’t have the full-time job, he might go back to Canada any time. If so, I would not see my daughter any more. So I want to be granted with the custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	To your financial status, can you clarify how you raise your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	We are under the case of divorce. I hope that I can get the right to live in the house which my husband is living in after divorcing. That house is good for my daughter to grow. Also I provide a asset list to the court to make clear my financial status. In addition, I have full-time job and my wage a month is up to forty thousands. I think I capable to take care and raise my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	How’s going with your divorce case? Do you know when is the court’s decision? Or the maybe-date?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not sure. We will have the court date this Friday. I want to inform the judge of the divorce case…………

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Okay, I will arrange the social worker to visit both of you. And make evaluations separately between both of you and your daughter. It will be the reference to the court decision of the custody. Before that, will you want to share the custody? To the definition of shared custody, it means, in a period of time, the child is with father, then, in another period of time, the child is with mother.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	個人來說，我沒有很喜歡這個主意，我女兒還太小。她才八個月大，我不想要她年紀那麼小就經歷那麼多變動。對這麼小的小孩而言，一下跟爸爸住一下跟媽媽住可能會讓她覺得困惑。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	In that point, I agree with my husband. It’s too young to my daughter.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Okay I get it. I will arrange the visit of social worker. After the evaluation, we will arrange another court date to make opportunities that both parties can state. Is that okay with you?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	好的我對社工人員的探訪沒有意見。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	It’s fine with me, thank you.

en-US	Today’s purpose is to realize the position of you two about child rearing. And I hope that I can know that why do you to all think that yourself are suitable to raise this child. please elaborate this point in detail. In addition, I know that you are also in the divorce procedure, so I hope that both of you do not have any verbal attack to  each other in today’s court, it that ok with both of you?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Please tell me that why you want to fight for the custody? I know that you don’t have a full time job in Taiwan, and you are also a foreigner. As for fighting for child rearing , why do you think that you are suitable for ? 

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望我能獲得我女兒全部的撫養權。首先,我老婆早就不跟我們一起住了。我想陪著我女兒長大。再者，我早就聽聞我老婆已經跟另外一個男生住在一起了。如果這是真的，我非常懷疑我老婆是不是能給我女兒一個最完善的照顧。因此，我希望我可以獲得全部的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean that although you are in divorce procedure, your wife hasn’t lived with you. Moreover, you also suspect that your wife has already lived with another guy? In this situation, you don’t want to let your wife take care of your child, right?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的,這些是我的疑慮

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	besides, as for your personal financial status, how do you take your daughter?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	的確，我現在是沒有全職工作。但是我有很多份兼職工作可以有穩定的收入。我相信這些收入夠我可以照顧我自己以及我女兒。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	Yu just mentioned that you have several part time jobs so far。Because they are all part time jobs, can you estimate that how much fixed income do you earn each month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均有四到五份兼職工作。總共大概每個月可賺五萬塊。有時候，如果我有接到新的案件，就可以賺到更多錢。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	I want to ask you another question, which is that will you bring your daughter back to Canada and never come back after you are granted with sole custody. The reason why I ask you this question is that even if you are granted with sole custody, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your kid back to Canada, which means that you separate your daughter and wife. What’s your opinion about this?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待五年了。我有居留證號碼，而且我也喜歡這個地方。目前我沒有打算離開台灣。特別是我覺得我女兒應該要有權利可以看到她麼爸媽。我意思是，雖然我跟我老婆正在打離婚官司，我也沒有意思要打斷他們兩個之間的聯繫。甚至在官司期間，我固定會寄女兒的照片給我老婆。我甚至都會安排外出活動，鼓勵他多花時間跟我跟我女兒在一起。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	you mean that you don’t have intention of going back to your hometown recently, right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	對。我可能會回去是因為我媽媽老了也生病了。即使我回家加拿大，我也不會待很久。我甚至不會考慮帶我女兒一起去。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	now I am going to ask the other party that do you live with your husband now?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	yes, we have been separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	when do you …….

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	about two months ago

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	that is to say, you have been separated before you sue for divorce?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	yes

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	what’s your ………., I mean, who do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son …………

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? What the …….

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	he is my second husband

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	so whom you are fighting for child rearing is …………………..

zh-TW	對。
en-US	yes

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	how old is your son? And how old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	my son is seven years old, and my daughter is eight month old

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	so when you move out, whom does your daughter lives with ,you or your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	when I move out, my daughter is only two month old, she still needs me, so she lived with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	where is your daughter now?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	she lives with my husband now.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Do you have any agreement between you and your husband? Why your daughter lived with you before and now she lives with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	where I move in is smaller than that which my husband lived. As far as environment is concerned, it’s better for child, so I let my daughter live with my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	if there is ………., your environment condition is not good for your daughter, right? Why do you still want to fight for child rearing?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	………, how can I bear that I cannot see her anymore? My husband is Canadian, he doesn’t have steady job in Taiwan, he may go back to Canada anytime. In that way, I will no longer see my daughter. So , I hope I can fight for child rearing.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	as for your financial status, can you further elaborate that how do you afford your daughter’s arising expenditure?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	we are still in divorce procedure, so I hope that I can live in the house where my husband is living in. as for the environment, that would be suitable for my daughter. As for my personal financial status, I have provided the court with an asset list. Besides that, I have a regular income which is at least 40000 dollars. I think that I am able to raise my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	……… when does your sentence will make. That is to say,……

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure. We will attend the court on Friday. I hope that I can express my opinion of making the sentence done.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	alright, the court will arrange social worker to pay a visit to both of you and make a evaluation focus on how do you get along with your daughter. The court will decide which arrangement is better for child depends on their reports. Before that, I would like to ask you that will both of you consider keeping shared custody which means your child will live with father for some time and live with mother for another time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人是不喜歡這樣的安排，因為我女兒還太小。他只有8個月大。我不想要他跟著我們的決定兩地奔波。對於一個這麼小的小孩，這些對他來說實在是太困惑了，一下要跟媽媽住，一下又要跟爸爸住。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	as for this, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too small; she should not, and is not suitable for this kind of arrangement of shared custody

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	since that, we will arrange social worker to visit you first. After they finishing their reports, we will arrange the court date and …….

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我也同意社工探訪.

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today, we are here for the preparation procedure of Mr. Johnson and Miss. Shih, their child rearing case. Do both parties have lawyers?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I have my lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有請律師。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today, the judge mainly wants to know the idea of both parties on the child rearing case. I also want to know the reasons why do you think you are suitable to raise the children. Please answer the question to me. Also, I know you are dealing with the divorce case. Therefore, I don’t want to see any situation of verbal attack, do you understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	First, I want to ask few questions for the plaintiff. Why do you want to get the rearing right of your children. In my understandings, you don’t have the full-time job in Taiwan. And you are a foreigner. Why do you think that you are more suitable for raising your children?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望我可以得到我子女全部的扶養權，就以下這幾點。首先，我妻子已經沒有再跟我們住在一起了，我希望我可以陪伴著我孩子成長。此外，我還知道我太太跟其他男人住在一起，如果真是如此，我很懷疑她是否真能給我們的孩子最好的照顧。因此，我希望可以得到全部的扶養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that your wife is no longer live with you even if she is still under the divorcing case? Moreover, you doubt that she is living with another man now? It is because under such circumstance that you do not want her to take care of your child?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對，這是我主要這樣做的原因。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Regarding with your financial status, if you get the right to raise your daughter, how do you deal with your financial status? How do you have the money to take care of your daughter?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在沒有所謂正職的工作是事實啦，但是我現在也有一些打工啊，都可以帶給我固定的收入。我相信那些收入已經足夠讓我和我的女兒生活了。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because they are part-time jobs, can you calculate how much money that you are sure you can earn per month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我有四到五個打工的工作，平均來說。這大概可以讓我每個月賺五萬元左右吧。如果我有得到新的工作的話，也許這收入會更高。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Moreover, I want to know that if you have the right to raise children; will you take your child back to Canada and you will not come back ever again? I would ask this question is because even if you do get the right to raise your children, your wife may still have the visitation right for your child. If you take your child back to Canada, it will transform into the separation of the mother and the child. What your opinion about this?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣住五年了。我不只有居留證我也很喜歡這裡。到目前為止，我沒有想要離開台灣的打算。而且我也認同我女兒必須要見到父母雙方。而且我也想要重申，即使我和我太太目前還在打離婚官司，我卻沒有想阻止她們母女倆互相見面的權利。就在我們還在打離婚官司時，我不時會寄我女兒的照片給太太，我還邀請我太太一起和我和女兒出去玩。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you do not have the plan to go back to Canada recently? 

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	我也許會回加拿大，但那是因為我媽媽已經年紀很大而且又生病了。但是即使我回去了，我也不會長久待在那裡，我會讓我女兒一直和我待在一起。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Next, I want to ask few questions to the wife. Are you currently not living with your husband?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have already separately lived for about half a year.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the divorcing case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	so before you file the divorcing case, both of you did not live together anymore?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	What your living condition right now? I mean who did you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son from the first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? So ,which marriage is you with your current husband?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So, the case of rearing we are fighting now is for the daughter of your second marriage.

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and my daughter is eight months old.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, was your daughter with you or with your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	Since when I moved out, my daughter is just two months old, so she was with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Where is your daughter now?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	My daughter is with my husband now.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there any agreement between both parties? Why the daughter was with you first but the daughter was with your husband? 

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place I live after I moved out is smaller than the place my husband have. After consideration of the environment, I think the bigger house is more suitable for my daughter so I let my husband to take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstance does not change, I mean that you sill live in the smaller house, I don’t think it will be good for your child. Why do you want to fight for the rearing right?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is “my” daughter, I can’t imagine if I cannot see her anymore. Besides, my husband is a foreigner from Canada. He might go back to Canada because he even does not have a full-time job in Taiwan. In that case, I might not see my daughter ever again. As a result, I want to fight for the rearing right of my daughter. 

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	From your financial status, can you explain how do you plan to cover the money to take care of your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now, we are still on the divorce case. Now, I hope to get the court decision that my daughter and I can live in the house which my husband currently live. According to the environment, I think that house will be very suitable for the growth of my daughter. About my personal financial status, I have already given the court my asset lists. Moreover, I have the full-time job and the salary is about forty thousand NT dollars a month. I think I am able to take care of my daughter. 

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	Can you tell me what stage are your divorce case in? Do you know when or around what time the court decision will be given?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure. We will be here for the divorce case this Friday. I hope I may ask the judge of my divorce case to give the court decision as soon as possible.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	The court will hire the social workers to visit the houses of both parties. Also, according to the ways you dealing with your children, the social worker will evaluate it. The report will be examined by the court and we will make a decision on it. But before that, I want to ask both parties if you ever consider the shared custody? Shared custody is defined as follows, the child will firstly with the father and then he or she will latter with mother.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	就個人來講，我不太喜歡這種方式因為我女兒還很小，她才八個月大欸，我不想讓她經歷我和太太之間的變動，對這麼小的孩子來說，這會讓她很混亂，為什麼有時候和爸爸在一起，有時才能見媽媽呢?

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	To this point, I agree with my husband. My daughter is too young, she should not and not suitable to go through the changes.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	I see, we will arrange the social worker to visit both parties. After they write down their report, we will arrange the next court time. Then we will let both parties to state their thoughts, is it clear?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	好，社工人員來探訪沒有問題。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I agree with it, thank you.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today’s preparation procedure is for Ferry Johnson and Ms. Shi for child rearing procedure.Do both parties have lawyers?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I have a lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有，我也是。

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today I am here; my real purpose is to understand what’s your status in this child rearing. Also, I want to know why both of you think you have the right to rear this child. Please focus on this point clearly. Besides, I know you are under the procedure of the case of divorce. I hope you can avoid the verbal attacking, do you understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我瞭解。

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I do.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	So now, I will ask some question for plaintiff. Why you want to fight for the right for rearing your child? As I know, you don’t have the fall-time job in Taiwan now. You are a foreigner. Why do you think you are more proper than the defense that you can rear your child?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望能把我的孩子判給我是因為有一些考慮的。第一點，我的老婆沒有跟我們住在一起，我想在那看著我女兒長大。此外我聽說我老婆跟別人住。如果那是真的的話，我非常懷疑她是否有能力給們的女兒最好的照顧。因此我希望能得到全部的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean that your wife is under the procedure of a divorce case and she doesn’t live with you. Is that right? Also, you suspected that she is living with other man. Are those concerns that you think you don’t want your daughter to live with your wife?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	沒錯，那些是我主要的顧慮。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	As to your financial status, if you got the custody of your daughter, how can you raise her up?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在沒有全職工作是真的。但是我有幾分臨時工可以讓我有固定的收入，我認為我的收入足夠讓我和我的女兒生活。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that you have several part-time jobs. Because those jobs are part-time jobs, can you calculate how much can you earn each month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均大約有四到五個兼職。大約可以讓我賺到一萬五千元台幣每個月。有時候如果我有新的工作的話我會有新的收入。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	I have another question. If you have the custody of your daughter, will you bring her to Canada and never come back? The reason why I ask you that question is because although you have the custody of your daughter, your wife still has the visitation right. If you bring your daughter to your country that means you will violate the right of your wife to visit your daughter. What’s your point about this case?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我在台灣已經待了有五年了，我有居留證而且我喜歡這個地方。到目前為止我並沒有任何計畫打算離開台灣。而且我確信我的女兒有權力見到她的父母。在這裡我要強調的是:雖然我和我的老婆正在打離婚官司，但是我絕對不會切斷她們的關係。在我們打離婚官司的程序中，我時常會寄我們女兒的照片給我老婆看。我也時常安排出去，我們三個一起出遊。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	You mean that recently you will not return to your mother country, is that right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	不，有可能因為我的媽媽已經年老了也生病了。即使我回去但我也不會待太久，我甚至不會考慮把我女兒一起帶去。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	so now, I will ask some question for other party. You don’t live with your husband, right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you have the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	Before you have the case, you didn’t live together.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	Who do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I bring my son of my first marriage together.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? What is your marriage time with the plaintiff?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So now, we are talking about the custody of the daughter which is you and your second husband have. 

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is eight-year old and my daughter is eight months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	After you leave your home, who live with your daughter?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	Because when I leave my home, my daughter was only two months so I worked her out in order to take care of her.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Where is your daughter now?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	My daughter is in my husband’s house.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Do you have any agreement that your daughter live with you first and later she lives with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	After I left my house, I live in a small house, but the original one is bigger. According to the environment, my husband’s house is better for my child.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstance that your house is not good enough, your daughter lives with your husband is a better choice, isn’t that right? Why you want to own the custody of your daughter?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I spent ten months to have my daughter. How can I endure that I cannot see her in the future? Furthermore, my husband is a Canadian and he doesn’t have a full-time job. Also, he may leave Taiwan to Canada. As a result, I may not see my daughter in the future. So I hope I can fight for the custody of my daughter. 

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	How can you afford the expense for your daughter in your financial status?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now, we are still under the procedure of divorce case. I want to have the right to live in my husband’s house after the divorce. According to the environment, my husband’s house is suitable for my daughter to grow. As to my financial status, I have provided an asset list to the court. Besides, I have a regular full-time job. I earn about forty thousand NT dollars a month. I think I have the ability to take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	How’s your divorce case? When is the result be made about time?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure. This Friday we will have a court again. I will inform the judge in that court to make the decision earlier.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Ok, the court will have social workers to visit both of you, you and your husband. And make the evaluation to the situation that you and your husband’s accompanying your daughter. We will see the evaluation to decide the best choice for your daughter. So before the evaluation, I want to ask both of you that can you share the custody of your daughter? What is share custody is that your daughter will live with your husband for a period of time and later she will leave with you.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	基本上我不太贊同這個決議，因為我的女兒太小了，她才八個月大。我不想要她在我和我老婆之間換來換去。以我女兒現在的年紀來講，如果她一下子跟她媽媽住、一下子跟她爸爸住，這會讓她搞混。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	To that point, I agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young, so it’s not proper and should not use that method.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Ok, now we arrange the schedule of social worker first. After they make a report, we will arrange the court day to give you the opportunity to state yourself, is that ok?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	OK 沒問題。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I am ok, too.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	  Today we are here for the procedure of child rearing rights for Ms. Tsai-Hung Shin and Mr. Ferry Johnson. Do both have the lawyer?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I did

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有請律師

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today, I want to understand the viewpoints of child rearing for both sides. The court will also figure out why both sides want the right to raise child. Please make more statements at this point, OK? In addition to this case, the court also knew that you were undergoing the divorce case. Both sides should avoid verbal attack on the court. Do you fully understand?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Explain why you urged to get child rearing right. So far you don’t have the full time job in Taiwan. Basically, you are the foreigner. In this case, why did you think you have the better right to get this?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望能把所有的撫養權判給我，因為有兩個原因，首先，我太太沒有和我們住在一起，我希望能看到我女兒在這邊長大。此外，我聽到消息說我老婆和別的男人住在一起，如果情況真的如此，那我懷疑我女兒能否得到最完善的照顧，因此，我希望能得到所有的撫養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	In other words, your wife lived with another man when you had the divorce case. Besides, you also have the doubt she lives with another man. Under this circumstance, you are not willing to give the sole custody to her.

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的，這些就是我主要的考量

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	Concerning about the financial status, if you get the custody, what will you do?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	的確，我現在沒有拿到一個全職工作，但是我有幾份兼職的工作，可以讓我保持一個穩定的收入，我相信這個金錢來源，足夠讓我養活我們

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mention you have several part-time jobs. Because those are part-time jobs, can you tell the amount conservatively?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我大概有四到五份兼職工作，全部總計每個月大概可以有五萬的收入，如果有接到新的企劃，說不定能賺更多。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	So, another question would be that if you get the sole custody with your daughter, would you bring her to Canada and stay in Canada forever and would not come back to Taiwan? The reason why I ask this question is that even though you get the custody, your wife still has the visitation right to see your daughter. If you bring your daughter to Canada, it will become that you isolate your daughter from your wife. At this point, what is your opinion?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已在台灣待了四五年，我有居留證也喜歡這個地方，目前為止，我沒有任何計畫打算離開台灣。我認為我女兒有權可以看到我們雙方，我想強調的是即便我和我老婆在打離婚官司，但沒有打算切斷她們母女之間的關係。在整個離婚訴訟中，我也常寄女兒的圖片給我妻子看，我甚至還計畫讓她和女兒一起出遊，讓他多看看我們的女兒

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	What you mean is that you have no intention to come back to Canada, Right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	有可能回加拿大也可能是因為我母親又老又病，所以我必須得回去，就算我回去，也不會待太久，我不會考慮帶我女兒回去的可能。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	I will ask questions for the other side. You did not live with your husband, right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	We are separated for at least six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	 That is to say is that before you file the case, you did not live together, right?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So, let me ask you about your living status. I mean whom do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son who is born in my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	First marriage? What is the marriage with the defendant?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So, you are fighting for the child rearing right. Who is the child you fight with your husband?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son? How old is your daughter.

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old. My daughter is eight months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you leave out home, did your daughter come with you?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I left out home, I bring my daughter with me because she was just two months old at that time.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Who live with your daughter?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	My daughter lives with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there any agreement between you and him? Originally, your daughter lives with you. Why did your daughter live with him now?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place I live so far is small. Originally, our house was much bigger.Concerning for the environment, I think my husband’s house is better. I get my daughter to him.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	 For the objective circumstance, what I mean is that if your place has no change, it would be not good for your daughter. Why did you want to get the custody?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is my daughter with hard effort. How could I live without her? Besides, my husband is Canadian and his job is not stable. He has high possibility of coming back to Canada. In this way, I may not see my daughter anymore. Therefore, I want to get the custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	For your finical status, could you explain how you afford your daughter’s raising fee?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	So far we are in the progress of divorce case. I want to ask where my husband lives so far. For the finical status, I think that house will be suitable for my daughter. I have provided a piece of asset for the court. In addition to that, I have stable job which I can get forty thousand each month. I think I am able to raise my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	I want to the progress of your divorce case. Do you know when will the court make the judge or which day they will give answer?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure about that. We have to go to the court this Friday. I will send my concern to judge who is undergoing our case.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	OK, the court will send social workers to both sides to see our status. They will make the evaluation about how good is daughter to one side. The court will examine the report to make the decision which one is good to your daughter. Before that, will you consider the shared custody for both sides? The shared custody means that the daughter lives with father sometimes. For another time, she will live with mother.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人不太喜歡這樣的建議，因為我們女兒還小，他現在只有八個月大，我不希望她經歷在父母之間的轉換。對這麼小的兒童而言，一下子和爸爸住，一下又跟媽媽住，這對他們是困擾混淆的

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	 At this point, I am agree with my husband. Our daughter is too young, she is not able to or supposed to live this kind of environment.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	 In this way, the court will send social workers. After they make full report, we will arrange the date of court. By doing so, both sides have rights to make statements, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我可以接受社工拜訪

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I have no further question about that.

en-US	Today, judge wants to clarify your different point of view on this custody case. And I would like to know that why both of you think that you’re more appropriate to raise this child. Please say your statement according to this point. And I also know that you’re on the divorce trial. Therefore, I hope there would be not(no) verbal attack in this court.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了。

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	First, I would like to ask some questions to the plaintiff. Why do you want to ask for the right of child rearing? As I know, now you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan. Plus, you’re also a foreigner. When it comes to the child rearing, why do you think that you’re more appropriate to raise the child?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我想要請求我孩子的扶養權基於以下兩個原因。首先我的太太現在已經沒有和我同住了。我想要看著我的孩子成長。此外我也聽說我的太太現在和另一名男子同住，所以就此原因我很懷疑她是否能夠好好照顧小孩，因此我想要要求全權的扶養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that though you’re still on the divorce trial, you two didn’t live together now? Also you doubt that she is live with another man? Is that the reason that you don’t want to give your daughter to be taken care from(by) her?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的，這是我主要的考量。

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	In addition, as for the financial status, if you have the custody, how would you like to raise your daughter?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	事實上，我現在的確沒有全職的工作。但是我現在有打好幾份工、有固定的收入，我認為我的收入足夠養活我自己和我的女兒。

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	Do you mention that you have several part-time jobs? Because they’re all part-time jobs, so can you promise that how much you will receive as regular income per month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我平均會打四到五個工。大概總收入是五萬元。有時候如果我接到新的工作，我就會有更多的收入。

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Another question is that would you bring your daughter back to Canada if you get the custody. The reason why I’m asking this question is that even if you receive the custody, but your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring your daughter back to Canada that means you use another way to separate your daughter and your wife and that’s violated the visitation right. What do you have to say upon this point?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了。我已經拿到居留證了而且我也很喜歡這個地方。至今我還沒有要離開台灣。尤其我也認為我的女兒應該要有權力可以時常看到她的雙親。我想要強調的是儘管我們現在正在打離婚訴訟，但我並沒有想要把她和我太太拆散的意思。在我們打離婚官司的期間我常常有寄女兒的照片給她啊。我甚至有安排她們一起出去讓她們有更多的機會相處。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you don’t have the intention to go back to Canada recently?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	 不會，我只是可能會因為我母親年長而且生病的原因回去而已。就算我回去了我也不會待太久。我更不會考慮說會把女兒帶過去。

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	 Then I would like to ask a few questions to the other party. Are you living with your husband now or not?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes. We separated for about six month.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you raise the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	Maybe about two month ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	That means before you filed the divorce case you two hadn’t lived together, right?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	Now do you live with someone?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son and is from my ex-husband.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	You said that your son belongs to your first husband, so what is(how about) this time?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So let me clarify this. The daughter is the children(child) between you and your second husband?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son and how old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven years old and mu daughter is just eight months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you went out to live, whom did your daughter stay with?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I lived out, my daughter is just two months, so my daughter needs a lot of care, so she lived with me at that time.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	Now, who have(has) the child now?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	She lives with my husband now.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Do you have any agreement? Why did your daughter live with you and now don’t(doesn’t) and lives with your husband now?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	I moved to a smaller place and my husband’s home is bigger, so my daughter stays with him. It’s a more appropriate environment for my daughter, so I leave my daughter to him.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	If the objective circumstances, I mean the living environment, don’t change, it’s still not good for your daughter, right? Then why would you like to file for the custody?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I was pregnant for totally ten months and have her. How could I leave her alone? In addition, my husband is a Canadian. He doesn’t have a regular job. He doesn’t have fixed income. And maybe one day he will go back to Canada. If that’s the case, maybe I will never see my daughter. Therefore I would like to receive my daughter’s custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Can you explain further on the point of financial status to proof that you can raise your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now we’re still on the divorce case. I hope the result would be that my daughter will still live at the place that my husband lives in now. That would be a really good place for my daughter to grow up. As for my personal financial status, I have provide(d) the court my asset list. In addition I have a regular income per month. Every month I receive over 40,000 dollars. I think I have the ability to raise my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	So how’s your divorce case? How does the process go? Is there a set time that the result will come out?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not sure. We will have the divorce court this Friday. I hope I can state my hope to that judge that I want the result to come out soon.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Then we will sent(send) social workers to both of your parties. Besides, we will evaluate how you two take care of your child. We will consider their report and see who will be more appropriate to raise the child. Before that, I would like to ask both of you, do you have the will to have shared custody. The shared custody means that the child lives with one of the parent for a period of time and lives with the other for another period of time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人不是很贊成因為我們的孩子還很小。她只有八個月大而已欸，我不想要她一直經歷環境上的改變，在我和我太太之間來來去去的。對一個年紀還這麼小的孩子而言，如果她要一下跟爸爸住，一下跟媽媽住，她可能會很混亂。

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	On this point, I agree with him. Our daughter is still young and little and it’s not appropriate to have the shared custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Since that, we will sent(send) the social workers first. When they hand in their report, we will set another court. Then you will have the opportunities to state your opinion.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	是的，我同意讓社工來探視。

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I have no problems.

en-US	4 floor No.415, Sec. 2, Zhongcheng Rd., Shilin Dist., Taipei City

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today we are here for the child rearing case of Mr. Johnson and Ms. SHIH. Both you have your lawyer?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有律師

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today the court is to realize your will at child rearing. The court also like to know that each of you, what privilege you have to raise this child. Please focus on this point to deliberate, okay?Besides, I’m aware that you are going to divorce nowTherefore, I hope that both of you do not make any verbal attack, okay?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	The plaintiff, why is your reason for you to ask child rearing? As far as I know, you don’t have a full time job in Taiwan.Also you are a foreigner. In the case of strive for child rearing, what do you think you are more capable of?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望得到我孩子全部的扶養權，因為我覺得這樣對他比較好。 第一個理由，我太太之後不會跟我們住在一起了。我想要看著我的女兒成長。而且我聽說我的太太已經跟別的男人同居一起了。如果真的是那樣的話我懷疑他能提供給我女兒一個好的環境。因此我希望我能得到全部的扶養權。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	You mean that though you are still preparing divorce, and your wife has already lived with other man? And you also doubt that she lived with other man? It is because of that you don’t want your daughter to live with her?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對，這就是我主要考慮的原因

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	About your financial status, what are you going to do after you gain your daughter’s sole custody? 

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在確實是沒有一份全值的工作但是我有間很多份工作，這些工作就能提供給我穩定的收入。我認為我的收入足夠能支付我的生活和照顧我女兒

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned you have several part-time job Because all the jobs you said is part-time, can you expect how steady income every moth?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	平均來說，有四到五個兼職工作所以加總起來大概有一個月五萬塊如果有時候有些新的案件的話，我還會有些新的收入

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Another question I want to ask you will you take your daughter back to Canada after you get her whole custody?The reason I ask this question is because that even of you get the sole custody, your wife may have the chance to come to see her.If you decide to bring your daughter back to your country, that will be another way that you cut the tie with her mother.About this point what is your reason?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經再台灣待了五年了我有這裡的居留證，而且我也很喜歡這邊。到目前為止我還沒有打算要離開台灣 而且我也覺得我的女兒有他的權利可以來看兩方的父母。我想澄清一點就是，雖然我和他母親正準備要離婚，但我沒有打算要切斷他們母女的聯繫 在我們打官司的這段期間，我也會固定地寄女兒的照片給她我也會安排一些活動讓我三個能一起出去。

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean currently you don’t have any plan to go back to your country?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	對，我有可能會回去就是因為我媽媽年老了可能生病。可是就算我回去加拿大，我也不會在那邊久留。而且我也不會考慮把我女兒一起帶回去

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	So now let me ask the defendant. Now you are not live with your husband, is that right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have been separated for six moths.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you decided to file the case of divorce?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two moths ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So you mean before you file the divorce case, you were no longer live together?

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	yes

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So what id you living condition? I mean, who did you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son of my first marriage.

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	The first marriage? So what is the time marriage with the plaintiff?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He is my second husband.

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	So now the custody you are fighting for is with your second husband?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	yes

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is your son? How old is your daughter?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is seven yeas old and my daughter is eight months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, the daughter is with you or your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I moved out, my daughter is little and she needs my taking care of.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	So now the child is with who?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	Now she is with my husband.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Is there any agreement between you? Why the daughter was with you and now with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place I later lived is smaller, the original house with my husband is bigger. So as the living environment, the house with my husband is better for her.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	So if you don’t change, change your living condition, it is still she lives with your husband is better, isn’t it? So why do you want to have the sole cutosty?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	She is my daughter that I bear her for ten months and I give birth to her.Also my husband is Canadian and he didn’t have a full time job. So he, she might go back to Canada in any time. In that case, I might not see my daughter forever. That is the reason I want to strike the custody of my daughter.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	As your financial status, can your elaborate more details how you would like to take care of your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
zh-TW	我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。 至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	May I ask the ??Do you know when the result will made? 

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I am not sure about this.We will go to the court this Friday.I will have the court that the case can be done as soon as possible.

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Okay, the court will plan the social workers to visit both of youThey will made the evaluations of the condition you with your childAnd the court will consider the result according to their evaluationsBefore we started that, will you consider the share custody? The shared custody means that the child with the mother for a time and with the father for the rest of time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	現階段我不同意這個做法，因為她還太小 她才八個月大我不想因為我們的關係讓她受到影響像他這麼小的小孩，要他一下跟著爸爸，一下跟著媽媽，這實在太辛苦了

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	I agree with my husband at this point.Our daughter is too young to shared custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Well okay, we will arrange the social worker first.After they made the results, we will decide another date for court.To provide both of you to elaborate more.

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	我可以接受社工的安排

en-US	Today the court aiming… aims at knowing the status and the thoughts of the two parties. The court would like to know the reason why each of you consider yourself is more suitable to keep the child. Please verify more… tell us more details about this… point. In addition, I know…the court knows the two parties…. is under the divorce case. So I hope that the two parties will not have any verbal attack to each other.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Plaintiff, I have some questions for you. Plaintiff, what’s the reason that you want to strive for the custody of raising your child? As far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job in Taiwan now. And you are a foreigner. In the case of fighting for the child rearing custody, why do you feel you will be more suitable?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望法院能判我女兒的全部撫養權給我, 那我有兩個理由.首先是, 我的太太已經沒有跟我們住在一起了, 我想要親眼看著我的孩子長大, 而且我也聽說我的太太已經跟別的男人同居了, 如果這事情是真的的話, 那我懷疑她有辦法給我們孩子最好的照顧, 因此我希望能得到所有的撫養權

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean by that your wife hasn’t lived with you, even if you are now filing for the divorce case? And you also doubt that she lives with another man? Because of these situations that you are not willing to give her the right to raise the child?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	是的,這就是我主要的原因

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	As for your personal financial status, what do you plan…..how do you plan to raise your daughter without a full-time job?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在的確沒有一份全職的工作, 但我身兼好幾份兼職工作, 而且帶給我一份穩定的收入, 我認為我賺來的錢是足夠我和我的女兒生活的

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You have mentioned that you have several part-time jobs, since they are all part-time jobs, can you possibly count how much money you can make every month?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我有四到五個兼職工作, 總加起來大概有台幣五萬塊, 如果有更多的計畫或工作給我的話, 我就可以得到更多的錢

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	Another question I would like to ask you, after you have the rights…the custody, will you bring your daughter back to Canada and will not come back anymore? The reason why I ask you is that even if you get the custody, your wife still have the visitation right. If you bring the kid back to your country, it can be counted as a another way to cut the ties of the daughter with her mother. As for this point, what is your opinion?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我已經在台灣待了五年了, 我有居留證, 而且我也喜歡這個地方, 到目前為止我並沒有打算要離開台灣, 而且我也認為我的女兒有權利見到她的雙方父母親, 我想強調的是, 雖然我和我的太太正在進行離婚官司, 但我絕對不會想要切斷他們的母子的連繫, 在我們打官司的期間, 我都會固定寄我女兒的照片給我的太太, 我也會安排出遊, 就是她和我, 以及我女兒一起出遊的機會

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	So you mean that currently, recently, you don’t have the intention to go back to your country?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	我可能會因為我的母親…在加拿大的母親比較老了或是病了而回國, 但就算我回去我也不會在那邊留很久, 我甚至不會考慮要把我的女兒帶去加拿大

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Okay I would like to ask another party. So now you don’t live with your husband now right?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we have been separated for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	What’s the time when you file the divorce case

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	About two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	That is to say, before you file the case of divorce, you two didn’t live together.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So what’s your situation of your accommodation? I mean, who do you live with now?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son, which… who is from my first marriage

zh-TW	第一任婚姻？那你跟告訴人的婚姻是第幾次？
en-US	Your first marriage? So… what’s………. this marriage?

zh-TW	他是我第二任先生。
en-US	He’s my second husband

zh-TW	所以現在爭的子女撫養權，是你跟第二任先生的小孩？是個女兒？
en-US	The custody you’re striving for, is the custody of a daughter of your second husband, right?

zh-TW	對。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	你的兒子幾歲了？女兒幾歲了？
en-US	How old is… are you daughter and your son?

zh-TW	我兒子7歲了，我女兒8個月大。
en-US	My son is 7 year-old and my daughter is eight months.

zh-TW	那你搬出去住的時候，女兒是跟你、還是跟他？
en-US	When you moved out, was your daughter with you or with your husband?

zh-TW	因為我搬出去的時候，女兒只有2個月大，還很需要我的照顧，所以孩子跟我。
en-US	When I moved out, because my daughter was 2 months …. in the year of 2 months, she needed me, so she was with me.

zh-TW	那現在孩子在誰那裏？
en-US	For now, where is your child, with you or your husband?

zh-TW	現在女兒在我先生那裏。
en-US	She is with my husband now.

zh-TW	你們中間有什麼協議嗎，為什麼原來女兒跟你，現在跟他。
en-US	Was any agreement between you two, why was your daughter with you at first and then now with your husband?

zh-TW	我搬出來住的地方比較小，原來跟先生的房子比較大。環境上來說，對孩子比較優，所以我把孩子交給先生。
en-US	The place I moved in is smaller and the original house we lived in is bigger. Concerning the environment, I decided to give my daughter to my husband.

zh-TW	那如果客觀條件沒有改變的話，你的居住環境，對你女兒仍然比較不好，不是嗎？那為什麼會希望能夠爭取子女撫養權呢
en-US	In the case of the objective circumstances, if your accommodation is still… that, it is not improved yet, is it better for your daughter? So why would you like to strive for the custody?

zh-TW	她是我懷胎十個月生下來的阿，我怎麼捨得以後都看不到她呢？而且我先生是加拿大籍，他在台灣的工作也沒有很穩定，隨時有可能會回去加拿大，那這樣子的話，我不就見不到女兒了嗎？所以我希望能夠爭取女兒的撫養權。
en-US	I borned her with 10 months. How could I bear the pain of being separated with her? Also, my husband is a Canadian, the jobs he has in Taiwan isn’t…aren’t very stable and he might go back to Canada. In that case, I cannot see my daughter anymore. That’s the reason why I would like to strive for my daughter’s custody.

zh-TW	就妳的經濟能力而言，你可以加以說明如何負擔女兒的撫養費用嗎？
en-US	Concerning your financial status, can you elaborate how would you like to arrange the money to raise your daughter?

zh-TW	我們目前還在打離婚官司，我希望能夠爭取到離婚之後能住在我先生現居的那棟房子裡，所以就環境來講，那棟房子會很適合我女兒成長。至於我個人的經濟能力，我有提供給法院一份目前我的財產表，除此之外，我也有固定的工作，一個月收入至少是4萬以上。我想我有能力撫養、照顧我的女兒。
en-US	Now we are under the divorce case, I hope to get the house we used to live together, that it the house my husband is living now. Concerning the environment, the house will be very suitable for my daughter to grow up. As for my financial status, I’ve provided the court…. my asset list. In addition, I have a stable job, which may have me owned 40,000 dollars at least. I think I can take care of my daughter.

zh-TW	請問你們目前的離婚案件進行地如何？有預定什麼時候判決會出來嗎？或是說，大概什麼時候判決會出來？
en-US	May I ask how your divorce case proceed? Do you know when the trial will be.. approximately will be?

zh-TW	我不太確定，我們這個禮拜五還會再出庭一次，可是我希望能夠向離婚案件的法官表達，希望判決能夠盡快出來。
en-US	I’m not sure about that. We have to go to the court on Friday again. I will tell the court that I hope the trail and the result will come out as soon as possible

zh-TW	這樣好了，本院會安排社工人員造訪告訴人跟相對人雙方，並且針對你們與孩子的相處情況做出評估，本庭會參考他們的報告，來決定怎麼樣的安排對孩子是最好的。不過在那之前，想先請問一下，你們雙方會考慮共同持有撫養權嗎？所謂的共同撫養，是指孩子一段時間跟父親、另外一段時間跟母親。
en-US	Ok, the court will arrange the social workers to visit both parties, they will evaluate how you deal with your daughter…. The court will consider the result and decide what’s the best result for your daughter. Before that happens, I would like to ask the two parties, will you two consider the shared custody? That is, the child will accompany the mother for a period of time and then accompany with the father for another period of time.

en-US	Personally, I do not favor this arrangement because my daughter is still too small. She is only 8 months old. I don’t want her to go through the changes between me and my wife. For a child at such a young age, it is too confusing for her if she has to stay with one parent for some time and another for another period of time.
zh-TW	我個人不太喜歡這樣的決定, 因為我的女兒還太小了, 她才8個月大而已, 我不希望她在我和我妻子之間來來回回的, 對一個這麼小的孩子來說, 她會非常疑惑, 為什麼一下跟這個… 一下跟爸爸一下跟媽媽… 相處一段時間

zh-TW	在這點上面，我同意我先生的看法。女兒還太小，不應該、也不適合共同撫養的安排方式。
en-US	I agree with my husband at the point. Our daughter is too young, it will not be a good resolution to use the shared custody.

zh-TW	既然如此，那麼我們就先進行社工探視的安排。等到他們做出報告，我們再安排庭期，讓雙方有陳述意見的機會。這樣可以嗎？
en-US	Okay, so we will arrange the visit of social workers first. After they make the report, we will set the court date afterward, and the both parties will have the chance to elaborate themselves, is that okay with you?

en-US	Yes, I am fine with social workers’ visits.
zh-TW	是的, 我可以接受社工人員的探訪

zh-TW	沒有問題，謝謝。
en-US	I have no further questions as well.

zh-TW	今天我們進行Ferry Johnson與史彩雲之子女撫養權之準備程序。請問雙方都有請辯護人嗎？
en-US	Today we are going to do the preparing procedure of child rearing custody between Ferry Johnson and彩雲史.Do both parties have a lawyer?

zh-TW	我有委託律師。
en-US	Yes, I do have a lawyer.

en-US	I also have a lawyer.
zh-TW	我也有請律師

zh-TW	今天的準備程序中，我主要希望了解雙方在子女撫養權上的立場，也希望能夠知道為什麼你們各自認為自己比較適任撫養這個孩子。請就這一點特別的加以闡述，好嗎？此外，我知道你們這一件，也正在打離婚案件，所以希望雙方盡量不要發生在言語上攻擊對方的情況。了解嗎？
en-US	Today, the court is going to know the parties’ opinion about today’s procedure in child rearing custody.I also wonder why both parties think … you are … the more suitable person than the other party.Please elaborate more on this point.In addition, I know you both are also doing the divorce case.Therefore, I hope both won’t have much verbal attack to each other.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	了解。
en-US	I understand

zh-TW	請問告訴人你為什麼希望能夠爭取孩子的撫養權？就我所知，你目前在台灣並沒有全職的工作，又因為你本人是外國人的身分，在爭取子女撫養權一事上，你為什麼認為你比較適任呢？
en-US	Plaintiff, what is your reason to fight for the custody of children?As far as I know, you don’t have a full-time job regularly in Taiwan.Also you are a foreigner.In this case, why do you think you are the more appropriate person to have the custody of children?

en-US	I hope to be granted with the sole custody of my daughter because of two concerns. First, my wife no longer lives with us. I want to be there to see my daughter grow up. Moreover, I have heard that my wife is living with another man. If that is the case, I doubt it very much that she can give our daughter the best care she deserves. Therefore, I hope to have the sole custody.
zh-TW	我希望我可以獲得我女兒的全部撫養權，有以下兩個原因首先，我太太已經不和我們住在一起了我想要參與我女兒的成長過程此外，我還聽說我的…妻子已經和另一個男人同居了如果真的是那樣的話，我很懷疑她是不是能好好地照顧我的小孩因此，我希望我可以獲得全部扶養權

zh-TW	你的意思是說，因為你太太雖然目前還在跟你打離婚官司，可是她已經沒有跟你同住，而且你還懷疑她與其他男子同居。因為這種情況，你不願意把你們的孩子交給她照顧，是這樣子的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that even you both still engage in the divorce case, your wife…already lived with another man?And you also doubt that she lived with another manBased on this situation, it is the reason why you don’t want to give the custody of children to your wife?

en-US	Yes, those are my main concerns.
zh-TW	對，那是我最主要的考量

zh-TW	另外，那麼對於你個人的經濟能力，也就是你如果能到子女撫養權，你打算要怎麼照顧你的女兒？
en-US	In addition, concerning your personal financial status, do you really be able to raise your child?

en-US	It is true that I don’t currently hold a full-time job. However, I have several part-time jobs which bring me a regular income. I believe that income will be sufficient for me to take care of myself and my daughter.
zh-TW	我現在確實是沒有全職的工作但是我有許多的兼職工作，讓我有固定的收入我相信這些收入是足夠能讓我扶養我的女兒的

zh-TW	你剛剛提到你目前有好幾份兼職工作，因為它們本身都是兼職的性質，你能夠保守估計自己每個月會有多少的固定收入嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that you have several part-time jobs.Because these jobs are all part-time, can you approximately come up the total regular income you will receive?

en-US	I have, on average, four to five part-time jobs. As a total, they will bring me about NT$50,000 per month. Sometimes, if I have new projects, I may be able to have more income.
zh-TW	我大概有四到五份兼職工作平均每個月這些薪水加起來的話，大概會有五萬塊的薪水如果有時後有新的案子進來的話，我的收入就會更高

zh-TW	另外我想要問的問題，是關於你有沒有可能在得到孩子撫養權後，把孩子帶回加拿大，就不回來了呢？我會這樣問，主要是因為，即使你拿到撫養權，你太太還是可能可以保有探視權，如果你把小孩子帶回你的國家，就會變成是變相的隔離她們母女見面。對這一點，你有什麼意見。
en-US	I also want to ask a question that if you…are granted with the custody of the child, will you bring the child back to Canada and never come back.The reason why I ask this question is that even if you are granted with the custody of the child, your wife still have the visitation right to the child.If you do bring your child back to Canada, it is kind of … behavior to cut the tie with your wife and the child.To this point, what is your explanation?

en-US	I have stayed in Taiwan for five years already. I have an ARC and I like this place. So far, I don’t have any plan to leave Taiwan. Especially, I believe that my daughter should have the opportunity to see both of her parents. I want to emphasize that although my wife and I are currently seeking a divorce, I have no intention of cutting the tie between her and my daughter. During the entire period of our divorce case, I have regularly sent our daughter’s pictures to my wife. I even arranged outings to encourage her to spend time with us, me and our daughter.
zh-TW	我來台灣待了五年了我有居留證，我也很喜歡這個地方目前為止，我並沒有任何要回家加拿大的計畫我覺得我的孩子有權利見他們的父母的我想要強調的是，即使我和我的妻子仍在打離婚訴訟，但我沒有想將我的孩子與我的妻子完全隔離關係就在打離婚訴訟的期間，我也常常將孩子送去給我妻子那邊，讓他們有相處的時間我甚至還跟她約一些時間，希望她可以和我還有小孩共度一些時間

zh-TW	所以你的意思是指，在近期之內你並沒有返回母國的打算，是這樣嗎？
en-US	Therefore, you mean, in the recent period, you don’t have any plan to go to Canada? Is that right?

en-US	No, I may go back to Canada because my mother is old and sick. However, even if I go back, I wouldn’t stay long. I won’t even consider the possibility of taking my daughter with me.
zh-TW	不，我還是有可能會回去加拿大的，因為我的母親很老了，而且她生病了即使我回去了，我也不會在那邊停留太久時間的我甚至不會考慮帶我的小孩一起回加拿大

zh-TW	那接下來我要請問相對人，請問你現在已經沒有跟先生同住了嗎？
en-US	Then I’m going to ask some questions to the other party.Do you…no longer live with your husband now?

zh-TW	對，我們已經分居六個月了。
en-US	Yes, we …have lived separately for six months.

zh-TW	請問妳是什麼時候提出離婚訴訟的。
en-US	When did you file the divorce case?

zh-TW	我大概是兩個月前提的。
en-US	I filed the case around two months ago.

zh-TW	也就是說，早在你提出離婚訴訟之前，你們就已經沒有住在一起了。
en-US	So, before you filed the divorce case, you…no longer lived with your husband already.

zh-TW	是的。
en-US	Yes.

zh-TW	那請問妳現在的居住狀況如何？我指的是，跟誰住？
en-US	So can you tell me what is your … I mean who do you live with?

zh-TW	我帶著第一任婚姻的兒子一起住。
en-US	I live with my son of my first marriage.
