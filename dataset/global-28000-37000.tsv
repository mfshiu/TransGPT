en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的學位是有關英語教學的。要完成這個學位，裡面有些關於教學的課程也有些關於中英語文能力的訓練。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you pursue for the English teaching mater degree; however there are still some further culture courses in that degree?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，至少有三門課是跟文化和溝通相關的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	You used the tem culture, so what would the teacher give you as assignments in the course?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這門課的功課可能會因學生而異。像我自己的話，我來台灣然後想要找一個英語教學的教師職位，為了要達成這個目標然後顯現這個能力，所以我必須要有足夠的中文能力。因此我很多作業都是關於中英句子的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean that your goal is to teach English in Taiwan, so the course would ask you to proof your Chinese competence? Therefore, you had to complete some assignments and these assignments are about English and Chinese translation?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	當然阿，而且我還需要磨練我的口說和寫作技巧

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay, so you said that this message content was your assignment right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對阿，我還記得那個句子是甚麼。當我看到一個中文句子的時候我可能會不知道如何用英文來表達。你也知道吧，中文字有些時候對於外國人來說很難辨認阿，所以我需要別人的幫助，所以我就問我同事，我請她幫我翻譯然後請她把答案以簡訊寫給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean that you ask your colleague this sentence in Chinese and she sent it back in English? Is this the situation? You mean that this message was just all about assignment?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那則簡訊真的就只是作業答案而已啦。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Then, how about the contents in Document One from page 14 to 16? Please check these messages. Are they all for your assignments? Just because you want your colleague to answer you in English?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，它們的目的都相同，就只是要幫我完成作業而已。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then how about the adultery between you and 王彩燕 from you wife?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	對於這件事我太太真的是想太多了。我知道她對於我可以照顧家庭的能力不滿意。我想讓您知道的是，從我開始念學位開始，她都很不支持，她甚至一點都不想要幫助我完成學位。如果她多幫我一點忙的話，我也不用問我同事啦，我想她應該要為這樣的誤解負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, you two don’t get along quite well?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在婚姻初期我們是相處得滿愉快的。但她一直對我的工作有微詞。我也嘗試要教葡萄牙語來維生，但工作不穩定。所以我們有時候會為了這件事有口角，我們常為了這件事情不合，她都不相信我有努力找工作，我也很難讓她理解我有多沮喪和挫折。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to the mater degree you mentioned. When did you start your master degree? When did you end it? Did you receive the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2010的春季開始上課。它是一個兩年的課程，我應該要在2012的12月完成這個學業，但是我並沒如期完成，因為我有一些兼職，還要寫作業，這樣有點困難。就想我先前說的，我太太不太支持我，所以我會覺得我自己在念書的時候好像只有一個人在奮鬥，所以我相當疲憊跟挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean that it’s two-year-long program and you didn’t finish it, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法達成每堂課的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When was(did) the last semester you registered end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋季班。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If what you said I is true, and the last semester of your registration ended on December 5th 2012; then after that you would not have to contact your colleague for the assignment right? However, you two, you and your colleague, had been contacting with each other for over six months after that.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我可能真的無法完成學業，但並不代表我不想學習阿。雖然我無法完成學業，但我想持續精進中文，所以才會繼續和她聯絡。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even that you didn’t complete your degree, you still want to sharpen your Chinese by your own?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	是的，這就是我繼續和我同事尋求協助的原因。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	Your colleague is just like your tutor right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是家教的角色她還是我真心的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我曾經有提過，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why would she like to teach you Chinese so late at night, even it’s time for bed? Is it beyond the normal relationships between colleagues?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	我說過啦，她是一個很好的朋友，很支持我。她用她自己私人的時間來教我中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach at that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是的，我還在那裏工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does 王彩燕 also work there till now?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那裏工作，但我們沒有再搭檔合作了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Is there any person you want to subpoena or is there any evidence you want to investigate more?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena 王彩燕 as a witness from 伯元cram school. I want her to describe their relationships and why she wrote that kind of messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that cram school has taken some actions for their relationships. Further, the cram school had tried to make 王彩燕 off. I don’t know if there is any possibility to proof this.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? Now the situation is that your program should end on December 5th 2012, and you should not use completing assignments as an excuse to contact 王彩燕. The text messages between you two almost happened after 9 p.m. It’s really easily to rouse people’s curiosity. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我實在想不到有甚麼其他的證據了，誠如我之前所說的，我和我同事之間的簡訊互動真的很普通，我真的只是想要增進中文能力然後繼續學中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	Then we set next court at 4:30 p.m. on June 9th 2014 for the witness procedure. Please both of you show up at that time. If it’s necessary, you two have the right to lawyer.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Today’s court is adjourned.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we’re here for the preparation of adultery case.The plaintiff, Ms. Chen, sued the case.The main reason is that her husband is too intimate with his colleague at the cram school.The plaintiff found some messages from his colleague.besides, her husband always makes up reasons for staying late and even have conferencing with Wang zhia yen at night.The plaintiff thinks that the contents of her husband with his colleague Ms. Wang has over beyond colleagues relationship. As a result, she sued the case. Defendant, you wife sued you adultery. What’s your explanation?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我無罪

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparation procedure, we would like to clarify the details of the defendant and Ms.Wang. We are to find whether their relationship can constitute adultery. Do both parties understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	yes I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	how long have you been married? You have kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	we have been married for four years. We don’t have children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you two marry in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan and he wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	in the past few years, he worked at Taiwan as a Portuguese teacher?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language to learn, his teaching hours was unstable.sometimes he did not have to work for a month.Later he wanted to teach English, in order to have stable teaching hours.But his mother tongue is not English, so he decides to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned he seek an advanced degree, you mean he want to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get the degree of English- teaching.He found a online learning program from California in the USA on the internet.He can learn English on the internet without going to the USA.After he finishes the program, he can get a master degree.His original plan is that after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan as a professor.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship between he and the person he has affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues at the cram school.The cram school has an arrangement of a foreigner with a Chinese teacher. She’s his partner as a Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How come do you find out they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	First, I noticed that my husband always stayed late at the cram school and worked.I asked him several times, it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so many extra work?He told me that because he has to discuss many details with his partner.At first, I did not suspect him.But later I found that he always gets some calls after he came back.And, when he gets the calls, he talks in the study room. He never talks on the phone in front of me.So I checked his phone and I started to suspect him. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, there is always the same number.I was very curious and I checked his text message.After I checked, I found that she text the message with the woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	It’s just text messages, I think it’s okay, is there any weird content inside?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If these are just usual messages, that’s okay. But he’s a married man, how can he let the other people to send him those intimate messages? I’ve already provided some messages to the court, they should be on the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Document number 1 page number 13. Defendant, please check the content of the text messages.Are these from your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對 這些都是我手機裡的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I would like to ask you some questions about these messages.The first message is sent at 9:50 pm. November, thirty-one, 2012.from the number 0958932.The content is: I really miss you, my love, what’s the meaning of this?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我同事傳的，我記得那時我請了兩天假，她有點擔心,所以她寄了那封簡訊給我她是在美國讀書的，所以思想很開放那就是她表答自己的方法，她平常都這樣講話，至於my love那個地方只是要表答我們在乎的人

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean the sender was educated in the USA, so she’s more opened?She’s more open-minded about expressing herself, so there’s nothing with the two words, my love?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	那就是只是彼此是好朋友會這樣說而已，沒什麼啊

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	What about the last sentence she mentioned?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我剛剛說的，因為我請假所以她有點擔心，畢竟我們是搭檔, 她當然會擔心

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that she sent those two messages because you took two days off?Because without your assistance, she missed you, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對呀 就是這樣，沒什麼大不了

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Okay, then the second message which is sent at 11:55 at night, January thirteenth 2013, sent by the same person.The content is, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” Can you tell me what does it mean? Why she sends such a message? 

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這句話來告訴我要怎麼寫我一個中文的作業

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she sent you such a message is to help you with your homework? IWhat does it mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太剛剛告訴法官的，我之前想修碩士學位在課程中，我需要得到30個學分才能得到那個學位，當然我就會有一些作業

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain the details about your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我是在修英語課，在那些課程中有些是關於英語教學，有些則是關於文化與語言能力方面的

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you want to get the TESOL and there’s some cultural related program, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	我記得至少有三門課都跟語言文化有關係

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What’s the assignment in the program?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	語言文化的作業每個人不同我的話，因為我在台灣想要學習英文來當英文老師為了要達到這個目的，我必須要證明我對英文中文有足夠的了解所以很多的作業都是中英的翻譯句子

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to understand Chinese as to be the teacher in Taiwan?As a result, you have to finish your assignment including the translation of some Chinese and English? 

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的就是這樣, 而且我還需要增強我的寫作技巧以及口說

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay let’s go back to the sentence we just mentioned, is that your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	有 我還記得這個句子，當我拿到這個句子並不知道它的英文要怎麼講 你也知道有時候中文字對外國人來說真的很難，我需要別人幫忙所以我就請我的同事幫我我請她幫我翻譯那個句子然後再寄簡訊給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean that you asked your colleague to send you the answer with the text messages?Is that right?The content of the text message is just the answer of your assignment?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那些內容就只是我作業的答案而已

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Then let’s check the page number 14 to 16, the text messages content in the document, please check the content, are these text messages sent from the other party was because you have to deal with your homework?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What’s your explanation of your wife accused you of having adultery with you colleague?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太對這件事真的是想太多了，我知道她不滿意我在經濟能力可能無法養這個家我希望法官知道的是，在我剛開始要求學位的時候，她都沒有給我任何一點支持她根本不願意幫忙我完成我的學業, 如果她能稍微給我點支持，那我也不用找我的同事幫忙啊，我覺得會有這些誤會,都是因為他一開始不支持

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your explanation, it seems that there’s some trouble between you and your wife

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	結婚剛開始我們的確很開心，不過問題在我的工作，我想臺灣教葡萄牙語, 可是沒有辦法得到穩定的授課時數結果工作變成我們兩個吵架的原因，我們總是因為這件事情吵架，她不相信我已經在這方面盡力了，沒有辦法讓她了解我其實真的非常挫敗

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s get back to the master degree you just mentioned. When did you master degree begin, does it end? Did you get your degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的, 這是一個兩年的課程, 我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的但因為我兼職的關係所以我沒有辦法在時間內修完學分像我剛剛說的，我的老婆並沒有很支持我，我覺得好像只有我自己一個人努力在追求那個學位, 我覺得很累而且很受挫

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean that the program is for 2 years and you didn’t finish at the end, what’s the reason?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒修完全部的必修

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	Then when did your last semester you’ve registered end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是在2010的秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If that’s true, just as you’ve mentioned, then your last semester should be ended on fifth December in 2012There should be no more assignment, right? But the messages you text with your colleague last for 6 months after your program has ended, what’s the reason?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒有完成我的學業但不代表我不想要增進我的語言能力啊！即使我沒有成功地拿到那個學位，但我還是想要增進我的中文能力所以我還是繼續努力

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對, 這就是我還找我同事幫忙的原因

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So, your colleague served as your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的中文家教, 她也是一個真心好朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她不收

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why did she still send you the text messages on midnight, when she has to go to sleep? Is this beyond one’s colleague should do?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個非常支持朋友的人，她用了自己的時間來幫助我學習中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still work in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對 我還有在那邊工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is your colleague, zhia-yen, Wang, still works there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那邊工作, 但我們已經不是搭檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there any detail or any other information or people you want to subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena Ms.Wang who worked in the cram school. I would like her to explain her relation with the defendant and explain the content and the reason that she texted those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had do something to deal with their relationships. They asked Ms. Wang to leave that cram school, I would like to know if it’s possible to clarify this fact?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?The situation is that your master degree, the program has ended on fifth December, 2012. There’s no excuse to say that you and Ms. Wang text message to deal with your assignment.Especially, you always send messages to each other after 9 o’clock at night, and that is very suspicious. Is there evidence can help you with your case？

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法想到任何其他的證據法院可以幫我調查就像我剛才說的，我們兩個通簡訊的原因就是這麼簡單而已，我只是想要進步我的語言能力然後繼續學中文而已

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The court will set at 4:30 p.m., ninth June, 2014, to cross question the witness, the defendant and the plaintiff should be there as well, if it’s needed, both parties can have your lawyer with you.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的我知道了

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we’re going to proceed the preparatory procedure of adultery case. The plaintiff, yu-hua, Chen, sued the case. The main reason is that… his…her husband is so intimate with his colleague at the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages from his colleague. In addition, her husband always makes up reasons for staying late and even have conferencing with Wang zhia…yen… at night. The plaintiff thinks that the contents of her husband with his colleague Wang zhia yen has over…beyond co-worker relationship. As a result, she sued the case. Defendant, you wife sued you…adultery, what’s your plead?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然沒有罪啊!

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, we mainly want to clarify the details of the defendant and zhia yen Wang. We aim at……to find whether their relationship can constitute adultery. Do both parties understand… know the process?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you married with your husband? Do you have any child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have married for 4 years and we don’t have a child.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	And did you two marry in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met each other in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he came to Taiwan, and he wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	During the past years, was his job teaching Portuguese…in Taiwan?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he’s a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still teach Portuguese. However, since there were no many people … not many people want to learn Portuguese, his teaching hours was unstable. Even for one or two months, there’s a period between jobs. After……. After that, he changed to teach English, in order to have a better job. But his mother tongue is not English, so he decides to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned he seek an advanced degree, did he want to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he has to get the degree of English- teaching. He found a distance learning program from California in the USA on the internet. He can have the online learning without going to the USA … and learn English. After he gets all the credits, he can get a master degree. His original plan is that after he gets the master degree, he can teach English in Taiwan as a professor.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship between he and the person he has affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues at the cram school. The cram school has arranged.. arranged a foreigner and a Chinese teacher together, and she’s the one who he partnered with.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How come do you think they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	First, I noticed that my husband always stayed late at the cram school and worked. I asked him several times, it’s only a/ it’s just a cram school, why did he have to do so many extra work? He told me that because he has to partner with the Chinese teacher… they have to discuss many details. At first, I did not suspect him. But later on I found that he always gets some calls after he came back. And, when he gets the calls... picks up the phone, he always talks in the study room. He never talks on the phone in front of me. As a result, …I suspect,

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Is there anything unusual in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, there is always a… the same number, I’m very curious and then I checked his text message. After I checked, I found that she text the message with the woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	It’s just text messages, I think it’s okay, is there any unproper content inside?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If these are just usual messages, that’s okay. But he has… he’s a married man, how can he let the other party to text him with so many… text messages. I’ve already presented some text messages to the court, I think it is in the file… it should be on the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Document number… page number 13. Defendant, please check the content of the text messages. Are these from your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是 這些都是我手機裡的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	So I will ask you some questions about these messages. The first message is … was sent from…at 9:50 pm. November, 31th, 2012, from phone number 0958932…. The content is, I really miss you, my love, what’s the meaning of this?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我同事傳的, 我記得那天我請了兩天假, 她有點擔心, 所以她才寄了那封簡訊給我, 我同事是在美國讀書的, 所以她的思想很開放, 那就是她表答自己的方法, 她都是這樣說話, 至於my love那個地方只是要表答我們在乎的人

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean by … do you mean that…the sender was educated in the USA, so she’s more westernized? And she’s more open-minded about her feeling? So there’s nothing, or any meaningful/ meaning of the two words, my love?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	那就是只是彼此是好朋友會這樣說而已, 並沒有什麼

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	What about… how about the last sentence she mentioned?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我剛剛說的, 因為我請假, 她有點擔心, 我們就只是同事啊, 畢竟我們是搭檔, 她當然會擔心

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that she sent those two messages because you took 2 days-off? Because there’s no your assistance, she missed you, is that so?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對呀 就只是這樣的內容, 就沒有什麼大不了的

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Okay, then the second message which is sent at 11:55 at night, January 13th, 2013, and was sent from the same person. The content is, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” Can you tell me what does it mean? Why she sends such a message?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這句話來告訴我要怎麼寫我一個中文的專案

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she sent you such a message, is that she wants to help you with your homework? Is that right? What does it mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太剛剛告訴法官的, 我之前在…想得到碩士學位, 在那個課程中, 我需要得到30個學分才能得到那個學位, 當然我就會有一些作業要寫

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain… the details…about your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我是在修英語教學, 在那些課程中有些是關於英語教學, 有些則是關於文化與語言能力方面的

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you want to get the TESOL … you study for the TESOL program, and there’s some cultural related program, is that so?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	我記得至少有三門課都跟語言文化有關係

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	Then what’s the assignment/ what are the assignments provided from these program?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	語言文化的作業… 因人而異, 像我的呢, 就是, 我在台灣想要學習英文並且當英文老師, 為了要達到這個目的, 我必須要證明我對英文中文有很大…足夠的了解. 所以我很多的作業都是中英的翻譯句子

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to understand Chinese as to be the teacher in Taiwan? As a result, you have to finish your assignment and the homework includes the translation of  some Chinese and English?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的就是這樣, 而且我還需要增強我的寫作技巧以及口說技巧

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s… go back to the sentence we just mentioned, is that your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對啊 我還記得這個句子, 當我拿到這個句子並不知道它的英文要怎麼講, 你也知道有時候中文字對外國人來說真的很難, 我需要別人幫忙, 所以我就請我的同事幫我, 我請她幫我翻譯那個句子然後再寄簡訊給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean that you asked your colleague to send you the answer with the text messages? Is that the case? The content of the text message is just the answer of your assignment

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那些內容就只是我作業的答案而已

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Then let’s check the page number 14 to 16, the text messages content in the document, please check the content, are these text messages sent from the other party was because you have to deal with your homework?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對, 所有的這些簡訊都是為了要完成我的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What’s your explanation of your wife accused you of having adultery with you colleague?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太對這件事真的是想太多了, 我知道她不滿意我在經濟方面支持這個家庭的情況, 我希望法官知道的是, 在我剛開始要求學位的時候, 她都沒有給我任何一點支持, 她根本不願意幫忙我完成我的學業, 如果她能稍稍支持我一點, 那我也不用找我的同事幫忙啊, 我覺得會有這些誤會, 她才應該是要被責貴的人吧!

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your explanation, it seems that there’s some trouble between you and your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在一開始, 結婚前我們的確有一段很美好的時光, 但…問題在我的工作, 我想臺灣教葡萄牙語, 卻沒有辦法得到比較多的授課時數, 結果工作變成我們兩個吵架的原因, 我們總是因為這件事情吵架, 她不相信我已經在這方面盡力了, 我沒有辦法讓她了解我其實真的非常沮喪, 而且遇到很多困難

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s get back to the master degree you’ve just mentioned. When did you master degree begin, does it end? Did you get your degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我一開始是在2010年的春天開始的, 這是一個兩年的課程, 我原本應該要在2010的12月就完成我的學業的, 但因為我兼職的關係, 所以我沒有辦法在時間內修習所有我要的學分, 像我剛剛說的, 我的老婆並沒有很支持我, 我覺得好像只有我自己一個人孤獨的在追求那個學位, 我覺得很累而且很受挫

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean that the program is for 2 years and you didn’t finish at the end, what’s the reason?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法修完全部的必修

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	Then when did your last semester you’ve registered end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是在2010的秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If that’s the case, just as you’ve mentioned, then your last… the last semester should be ended on 5th December in 2012, there should be no more assignment, right? But the messages you text with your colleague last for 6 months after your program has ended, what’s the reason?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我的確沒有完成我的學業, 但這也不代表我不想要增進我的語言能力啊! 即使我沒有成功地拿到那個學位, 但我還是想要增進我的中文能力, 所以我還是繼續研讀

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even you didn’t finish your program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability and be fluently speaking Chinese, is that so?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對, 這就是我還找我同事幫忙的原因

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So, your colleague can be said as… served as your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的中文家教, 她也是一個真的好朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有, 我有跟她說我要付她錢可是她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why did she still send you the text messages on midnight, when she has to go to sleep? Is this beyond one’s colleague should do?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個非常支持朋友的人, 她用了自己的時間來幫助我學習中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still work in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對, 我還有在那邊工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is your colleague, zhia-yen, Wang, still works there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那邊工作, 但我們已經不是搭檔了!

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there any detail or any other information or people you want to subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena the…to subpoena zhia-yen, Wang who worked in po-yun cram school… as a witness. I would like her to explain her relation with the defendant and explain the content and the reason that she texted those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had do something to deal with … their relationships. One of that thing is that they … asked zhia-yen, Wang to leave that cram school, I would like to know if it’s possible to clarify this fact?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you? The situation is that your master degree, the program has ended on 5th December, 2012. There’s no excuse to say that you and zhia-yen, Wang text message to deal with your assignment. Especially, you always, you texted messages to each other after 9 o’clock at night, and that is very suspicious. Is there evidence can help you with your case？

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法想到任何其他的證據法院可以幫我調查的, 就像是我說的, 我們兩個通簡訊的原因就是這麼簡單而已.我只是想要進步我的語言能力然後繼續學中文而已

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So, the court will set at 4:30 p.m., 9th June, 2014, to cross question the witness, the defendant and the plaintiff should be there as well, if it’s necessary, both parties can have your lawyer with you.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的我知道了

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	So the court is adjourned.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case.The plaintiff, Yu Hua Chen filed this case.The reason why she filed the case is because her husband … had too imitate relationship with his colleague.The plaintiff found some very intimate massage in her husband’s cell phone.Plaintiff husband usually make up reasons for going home late … and have teleconference with his colleague彩燕王The … information that plaintiff had collected proved that her husband and his colleague has beyond co-workers’ relationship. As a result, the plaintiff filed the case.Defendant, your wife stated that you have committed adultery. In this case, what’s your plea? 

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯，當然

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the court is mainly to … know the details in those intimate massages.The purpose of today’s court is to find out whether the defendant does have committed adultery with defendant’s colleagueDo both parties understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long…have you married your husband? And do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years. And we don’t have children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or in the foreign country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the past years, his job is teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	At first we met, he worked as a teacher who was teaching Portuguese.After he got married, he is still teaching PortugueseHowever, the Portuguese is … always not a popular language in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hours are always not very long.Sometimes … the period between jobs might be one month or two months.Later on, he hopes to have stable income. Therefore, he started to want to teach English.But English is not his mother tongue; he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Did you mean that he wanted to study a diploma in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	NoBecause he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he needed to have a degree relating to English teaching.He found a program provided from the California online.  He didn’t have to go to America to learn the course. Instead, he can learn the course through on-line learning.If he finished all the courses required, he can have the degree.His plan is once he has the degree, he can apply for the jobs to teach English through this degree.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What is the relationship between him and his colleague?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in the cram school.The cram school will have a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher in the same class. And the woman is the Chinese teacher in his class.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know he had an affair with her?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I’m only aware of that he often stayed late in the cram school.I have asked him for many times that why you have to stay late in the cram school.He told me that because he has to work with the Chinese teacher, they have many things to discuss.At first, I didn’t doubt him.However, I found that he would receive some phone calls after he came home.And when he got the phone call, he will talk to the phone in his study instead of in front of me.This behavior made me doubt him. That is the reason why I started to check his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	In the cell phone, did you find anything special?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, there is a phone number called him often.I became curious so I checked his texts.After I checked, I found that he almost texted with another woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Texting messages is fine, right? Is the content inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If that is a normal text, that is OK.However, he is married, how could he text with another woman in such an intimate tone?I have provided some messages to the court. I believe you can see them in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please see the page 13 of investigatory file.Here are some messages. Defendant, please take a look.Are they the messages on your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是，這些是我手機上的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	According these messages, I want to ask you some questions.The first message was texted at nine fifty pm on thirty first, November, 2012 from 0958-932*** The content is 我真的很想你，我的愛 What does it mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我一個同事發的我記得那時候我休了兩天的假 她有點擔心我這也就是為什麼他會傳這封簡訊給我我的同事是在美國受教育，所以她的思想比較開放這是她說話的方式至於她稱呼我為我的愛，那只是一種我們之間的稱呼而已

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that because the person who text you is educated in the United States, she is westernized.And the way she expressed herself is more openSo “my love” doesn’t mean anything special, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	當然，這只是一種表達關心的方式而已，只代表我們很關心彼此

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the previous statement?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就如同我之前說的，她非常擔心我，我們是工作上的同事 當我不在工作崗位上兩天，她當然會想我啊

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean the person texts you because you have two days off.Because she didn’t have your help in the class, she missed you?That’s all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對，當時的背景就是這樣，這封簡訊沒什麼

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message sent at eleven fifty fife p.m. on thirteenth, January, 2013 from the same phone number mentioned above.The content of the message is 我希望你可以在我身邊，什麼時候我們才可以在一起呢?What does this message mean? What did she send you this kind if message?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	 她寫給我這封簡訊的原因是教我在作業裡怎麼用中文講這句話

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she texted you this message to help you with your assignment?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我之前講的，我正在進修碩士學程在這個學程，我被要求要修滿三十學分，才可以取得這個學位很自然地，我就有一些作業和練習要做啊

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain what exactly you studied for your Master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的學位名稱是英語教學在這個學程裡面，主要的課程有關於英語教學，其他則關於文化還有語言能力方面的課程

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you are seeking a degree about English teaching, but there are some courses about culture and language competence.

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是，我記得至少有三個課程和文化與溝通有關

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	In this kind of courses, what kind of assignments would you have?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	語言與文化課程的作業可能會因同學而異就舉我為例子我是一個希望在台灣能取得教師資格的人為了要達成這個目的，我必須要證明我在使用中文上很有能力因此，大部分我的作業是有關中英的翻譯

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Because you planned to teach English in Taiwan, the course required you to prove that you have the competence in dominating Chinese.So you have to complete the assignments given by the course and they are about translating sentences

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，而且我還被要求加強我的口說以及寫作能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So back to the message. You said that it is your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我還記得這個句子當我拿這個中文句子的時候，我不知道怎麼把它翻成英文你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說總是比較難了解我需要一些幫助，所以我向我的同事請求幫助我請她幫我翻這個句子，然後將答案用簡訊傳給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean you asked how to translate the sentence to your colleague and she sent the answer to you through texts, right?That is to say, the text is only an answer for an assignment.

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，那封簡訊只是我一份作業的答案而已

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	 Now, please look at the page 14 to 16 of the investigatory file.Please look at them. They are the content of the messages. Are these messages all sent for doing the homework?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，這些簡訊的功用都是為了幫助我完成作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then the wife suspected that you have an affair with your colleague 彩燕王. What is your opinion?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太對這件事情真的是想太多了我知道她對我的養家能力非常不滿我希望庭上可以知道，在我在進修的時候，她從來沒有提供任何幫助給我她很不願意幫助我完成我的進修學業如果她有願意幫忙的話，我就沒有必要我問同事了我認為她要為這些誤解負責

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your responses, it seems that there are some problems between you and your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	 我們剛結婚的時候，我們的確過得很開心但我的就業卻是個問題我嘗試在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是卻沒有辦法有很穩定的工作時數所以我的工作就變成我們兩個之間很大的問題我們常常為這件事情吵架她並不相信我已經盡力了 她完全沒辦法理解我遇到的困難和挫折

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to the Master degree course you just mentioned.When did you begin the course of the Master degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年春季的時候開始上課的她是一個兩年的課程我應該要在2012年12月的時候完成這課程但是我並沒有完成這個學業，因為我有兼職工作，造成我沒有時間完成我的作業如同我之前所說的，我老婆並不很支持我我覺我是一個人孤軍奮戰地追求這個學業我感到很累而且很挫折

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You said the degree is a two-year program and you failed to finish it.

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我當時沒有辦法完成要求的課程

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	Then, when did the last semester you registered end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一個學期結束在2012年的秋季

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you said, since your course ended on fifth, December, 2012, after that, you shouldn’t have any assignment, should you? However, the messages you texted with your co-worker continued six months after you finished the course.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我雖然沒有完成那個學業，但這並不代表我不想增進我自己的語言能力啊雖然我沒有完成這個學業，我還是想要增進我的語言能力，所以我就開始自修

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	Even that you didn't finished the degree, you still wanted to improve your Chinese, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，就是為什麼我會尋求我同事的幫忙

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the character of your co-worker is more like a tutor, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她並不只是一個家教，她是我真正的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her money?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我曾經想付她錢，但她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn't pay her, why did she text you back in such a midnight? Does it already beyond co-woker's relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	這也就是為什麼我說她是一個很支持我的朋友嘛她願意犧牲自己的時間來幫助我學習中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是，我仍然在那裡任職

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does the co-worker, 彩燕王, still work there, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她還那裡任職，但是我們並沒有一起搭檔教學了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there any further witness to subpoena or investigation?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want subpoena the co-worker, 彩燕王, form the伯元cram school as a witness. I want her to explain the relationship between the defendant and her. I also want her to explain the context of these messages and the purpose.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintill, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school did take some actions about their relationship.They even did try to persuade 彩燕王 to resign. I don't know if there is a posibility to confirm this thing.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendent, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you?Now the situation is that your course already ended on fifth, December, 2012.There is no reson that you texted each other for helping you with your assignments.Especially, the messages you texted each other are after nine p.m. It is very doubtfull.Do you have any evidence that may help for your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不出任何可以幫助我的證據就如同我之前說的，我和我同事之間的溝通很簡單 我只是想要增進我的語言能力並加強中文

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So we set the next cout date at four thirty p.m. on ninth, June, 2014 to ask questions to the witness.Plaintiff and defendant, please show your attendence at that day.If necessary, you can have your own lawyers. Do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	是的我了解

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we’re here for the adultery case, preparatory procedure. the plaintiff Yu-hua Chen filed the case.it is mainly because she thinks that her husband, John Anderson, has an intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school.the plaintiff also found some intimate messages in the defendant’s cell phone.in addition, the defendant also made up reasons for extra working hours, and held tele-conferencing very often.What the plaintiff has found is beyond co-workers’ relationship.Therefore, she filed the case.the defendant, your wife filed you with adultery case. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the main focus is to find out details about your communication. another focus would be seeing if the behavior that you both had done constitute adultery or not.

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you been married?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We’ve been married for four years, and we don’t have any child.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you marry in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	i met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in the past few years, he works as a Portuguese teacher in Taiwan. Is that right?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	He was a Portuguese teacher when we met. After our marriage, he kept on being a Portuguese teacher. But since Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so he stopped teaching. Sometimes he didn’t work for one or two months. Later on, because he wanted to have a stable income, he started to teach English. Because his mother tongue is not English, he seeked an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned he’s seeking an advanced degree, so he decided to study in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. he hopes to teach English in Taiwan. What he really wants to obtain is an TESOL degree. He found a distance learning program in California online. So that he wouldn’t have to go to the states in order to get the degree. He only has to get it through distance online learning. After the program, he will obtain the master degree. His plan is through this program of TESOL, he could find a job as an English teacher.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what’s the relationship between him and the person he has affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They’re colleague in the same cram school. The school arranged a system. They require a Chinese teacher to work with a foreign teacher, and she is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know their affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At the very beginning, I noticed that he usually worked extra hours. I’ve asked him about this several times. It is a cram school. Why did he work that late? He told me that because he has a Chinese partner, he needs to negotiate some issues with her. At the very beginning, I trust him. Later on, I found that he often got some phone calls. He wouldn’t take them until he is away from me. Then I started to doubt everything, so I checked his phone book. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Is there anything weird you found?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his calling history, I usually saw the same number. Then I was curious about his messages. After that, I found he texted a girl almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Even if they texted each other every day, is that really wrong? Or you found something wrong in their message content?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If they were normal messages, I’ll just get through it. But he’s a married person, how can he receive intimate messages from a girl? Previously I have provided the court with some messages. They should be in the file. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please see page 13 on document 1. There are some messages. Defendant, please check. Are they the messages in your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的它們是

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	I would like to ask some questions about the messages. The first one was sent on 9:50 PM, November, 31 in 2012, and it is from the number 0958-932. It wrote 我真的很想你 I really miss you. What’s your explanation?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	是我同事傳來的。我記得那時候我請了兩天假，他有點擔心。也就是為甚麼他傳這封簡訊給我，他在美國接受教育，所以她比較開放。這就是他講話的方式，至於我所說的「愛」，這就是我們關心別人的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the message sender was educated in the states, so her ideas were quite westernized. Then she was quite open-minded about expressing her love. So the word “our love” doesn’t mean too much. Is that right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	當然啊，這在好朋友之間很平常，我們都是這麼說的。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the last sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的，他有點擔心我，我們是工作上的搭檔耶。當我離開工作兩天，他當然會想我啊

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So do you mean that because you had two days off and away from work. So she’s worried. Without your assistance at work, so she misses you. That’s all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊，那就是當時的情境，整個簡訊並沒有甚麼大不了

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Then the second message that we’re showing is sent at 11:55 PM on 13, January on 2013. It’s also from the same number. The content is “I want to..我想要你在我身邊，我們甚麼時候可以真正在一起？” can you tell me why she wrote like this?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他寫這封簡訊給我因為他想要問我這個句子的…

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So she wrote the message to you because you asked her to help you with a project?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太先前所說的，我正在進修碩士。在那個學程之中，我要修三十學分才能取的學位。很自然地，我就要寫作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you make it clear that what is your master degree about?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	是英語教學。在這個課程中，大部分的課程都跟英語教學有關，然後其中一部分是跟語言及文化的能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you’re seeking a master degree on English teaching, and there’s some courses about cultures and languages. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，至少有三門課跟文化還有語言相關。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	And this kind of cultural courses, what’s the assignment like?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	文化及溝通課程的作業每個人都不一樣。以我自己為例，我目前人在台灣，然後正在攻讀英語教學的碩士學位。為了要達成這個目標而且證明我的能力，我必須要證明我有中文的能力。所以很多我的作業是翻成中文的句子。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan. So the exercise in the courses ask you to show… that’s the reason why you need to finish some homework. And the homework is mainly about Chinese and English translation.

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對，我要磨練自己的口說還有寫作技巧。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So let’s go back to the message. This is your homework, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這個句子的時候，我不知道怎麼用英文表達。因為有些中文字對外國來講，很難去辨認。我需要幫助，所以我就請我同事幫我。我請他幫我翻譯這個句子，然後用訊息傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean that because you had an assignment, and you turned to her for help, so she sent the message for you. Is that right? In other words, the message is the answer of the homework, right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，那只是作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Then we’re going to see on page 14 to page 16. All the messages. Please verify the content. Are they all the answers of your homework?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，他們都是我的作業，全部都只有一個目的，就是為了完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	For the point of your wife saying you have an affair with your colleague 彩燕王. What’s your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	她想太多了，我知道他對我支持家庭並不滿意。我想讓庭上了解的是，在我碩士課程的剛開始，他就沒有提供任何協助。她不想要幫我完成學位。如果他願意幫一點點忙的話，我就不用請我同事幫忙。關於這一切的誤解，他要負最大的責任。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, the relationship between both of you doesn’t seem good.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	剛結婚的時候，我們的確有段開心的日子。但我的就業造成了一些問題。我想要在台灣交葡萄牙文，但是授課時數並不穩定。所以我的工作便造就了一切問題。我們常為這件事吵架。他不相信我已經盡了全力，我也不知道怎麼讓他了解我的挫折還有困難。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	So let’s go back to the master degree program. When did the program start?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始的。是兩年的課程。我在2012的十二月應該要結束。因為我那時候有兼職的工作，沒有足夠的時間完成作業，所以沒有準時畢業。如我先前所說的，我太太不願意幫忙。我覺得我是獨自一人追求那個學位。我很累也很挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean it is a two-year degree, and you didn’t finish it in time. Why is that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成課堂作業。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	So when was the last semester you registered?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	是在2012年的秋天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If what you have said is true, the last day of your semester should be on December 15th, 2012. So after the program, you won’t have any assignment. Is that right? But the intimate messages continued even six months later after your program. 

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	就算我沒有作業了，我也想要精進我的中文。雖然我沒有辦法取得那個學位了，我還是想要持續進修，成為獨立學習中文的人。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even if you don’t have the courses, you still want to improve your Chinese, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，這就是為甚麼我請我同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So she is like a tutor for you? 

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不只是像一個家教，他也像一個真正的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	我想要付錢，可是他拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why does she want to send the messages at midnight when most people are asleep. Isn’t it beyond what a co-worker would do?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我說他非常支持我啊。他用他自己的時間幫我學中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Did you still work in the same cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So your colleague 彩燕王also work there now?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	他還是在那邊上班，可是我們不是夥伴了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there anything that you want the court to investigate? Or any person to subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena his colleague 彩燕王 who is working at 伯元 cram school as a witness. I would like to ask her to explain the messages and her relationship between the defendant.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there anything that you want the court to investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has taken some action for the affair of them. And I also heard that they persuaded the woman 彩燕王 to resign. Is there the possibility to ask the cram school to explain about that?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there anything you want the court to investigate? The thing is the program ended on December 15, 2012. You can’t just explain your relationship with 彩燕王 through the purpose of finishing the homework. Especially your messages were usually sent during 9 to 12 PM. That is really doubtful. Do you have any evident that may help you in the case.

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到法庭能替我調查的事情。如我所說的，我和我同事的通訊，理由都很簡單。我只想要精進我的中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court date would be on 4:30 PM, June, 9th, 2014 for the inquiry procedure. Please make sure that you will be here. If necessary, you can have a lawyer with you.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	So the procedure ends here.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解了。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for preparatory procedure of adultery. The plaintiff files this case. The main reason that she files this case is because her husband has intimate relationship with his colleague. The plaintiff found some message in her husband’s cell phone. And her husband will use some excuse to chat with his colleague on the internet by tele-conferencing way. The message found by plaintiff showed that the relationship between her husband and his colleague is beyond colleague relationship. So, she files this case. Defendant, for what your wife said, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	For today’s preparatory procedure, we will understand the details of intimate message between defendant and his colleague. The main purpose is to make clear that the defendant and his colleague is adultery. Do both parties know the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我明白了。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long you got married with your husband? Do both of you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We got married for four years, and we don’t have children. 

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or other country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We got known each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan, and the main purpose is teaching Portugese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	For these years, did your husband just teach Portugese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we just meet each other, he was teaching Portugese. After we got married, he was still teaching Portugese. However, the Portugese class is not very common in Taiwan, so his teaching hours is not very stable. Sometimes, a period between the class will be 1~2 month. For fixed income, he started want to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he wanted to get an advanced degree. 

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	The advanced degree that you just mentioned means that he wanted to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he tried to get a degree of teaching English. He found a learning program on the internet from California. This program makes him can have on-line learning, and he didn’t need to go to Unite States for these classes. After the classes, he can get the degree. For this plan, he tried to get the degree and find a related job.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship that he has an affair with? 

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues in the cram school. The cram school set the Chinese teacher and foreign teacher program. And that woman is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	In the beginning, I just know that my husband would stay in the school for more hours. I asked him so many times: why he should stay in the school for more hours. It’s just a cram school. He told me that he has a partner, and he has to communicate with his partner for long time. In the beginning, I didn’t think too much. After that, I found he would get some calls in home. And he would avoid get the phone call around me, and he would get the phone call in study room. It made me very suspicious, and I started to check his cell phone. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find any evidence in his cell phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I used to see the same number in his cell phone. I am so suspicious, so I started to check his message. After that, I found that he almost sent the message to same woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	What’s inappropriate thing in the message?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If that’s a common message, it’s alright. But he got married, how can he have intimate message with others? I just provided some message to the court, and it supposed to be in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please see the investigatory file one of page13. There are some messages. Defendant, please see these pages. Is from your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這是我手機裡面的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now, I have some questions about these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50PM on November 31, 2012. And it’s from the cell phone number 0958-932… And the content is “我非常想你，我的愛” what that means?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	恩，那是由我同事傳給我的簡訊。我記得那時候我有兩天的休假，他非常擔心我，這就是為什麼他傳這個簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國接受教育，她非常開放。那就是她說話的方式。關於簡訊裡面的字眼，那只是我們稱呼對方的一種方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that because she stayed in the foreign country, her thinking way is westernized. And the way she showed the feeling is open-minded. So, there is no further explanation for “my love,” is that right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	並沒有甚麼其他的意思，那只是好朋友之間的一種稱呼，就僅只於這樣而已。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the sentence before that?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就如同我之前所說，她很擔心我，而且我們只是同事當我連續休了兩天假後，她只是很擔心我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that because you had two days off, she was worried about you and sent that message for you? Because she didn’t have your assistance, she missed you. That’s all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	沒錯，就是這樣。簡訊的內容並不是甚麼大問題。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was from the same person. It was sent at 11:55 PM, in January 13 2013. 訊息內容是〝我好希望你在我身邊，我們甚麼時候才能有正當的關係呢?〞What that sentence means?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她發這樣的簡訊給我只是想要讓我知道，這樣的句子如何用另外一個語言來表達。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you mean that the purpose of message just want to help you to do the assignment, what’s that mean? 

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我之前所說的，我有一個遠距教學的課程。在那個課程中我需要修習三十個學分才能完成那個課程。當然在課程中，我必須要完成一些作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you just explain about your degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我修習的課程是英語教學。課程主要的內容是英語教學、文化以及語言能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So, the degree that you got is TESOL, and there are some culture classes in that degree, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	沒錯，我記得大概有三個課程是有關於文化和溝通的部分。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What’s the assignment about these classes? 

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	在課程中，指派的作業對於每個人來說都不太一樣。舉我的例子來說，我是一個在台灣想要教英文的人。為了這個目的我必須在課程中展現我有能力表達好中文。因此，我的作業中有很多是關於中文翻譯的部分。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to have the competence of … For that purpose, you had to complete the assignment about translation, is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	沒錯，我必須增進我的說和寫能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So, we just go back to that sentence. You mean that the sentence is just for your assignment, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	沒錯我記得那個句子。當我看到那個中文句子後，我並不知道那句子的中文意思是甚麼意思，你知道的阿!有些中文句子對於外國人來說是非常困難的，我需要一些幫助，所以我請我同事幫忙，我請我的同事幫忙翻譯並以簡訊方式寄給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that you just asked her to translate. And she just translated it and sent it to you, is that right? This message is just the answer for the assignment, is that right? 

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊只是作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now, we are going to show you the investigatory file one page14~16. Please see the content of these pages. So, the main purpose of these messages just for the assignment, so she sent that messages for you, is that right, is that right?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯，所有的簡訊內容都只是為了要完成我的作業而已。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What’s your explanation of adultery between your colleague and you filed by your wife?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我的太太對於這件事情非常感冒，我知道她對於這件事情危害家庭有很大的不悅。我想要告訴庭上的是，她其實對於我的這個並沒有甚麼太大的幫助，他並不希望我得到學位，要是如果她有一點意願幫助我，我也不用去請我的同事幫忙，我覺得她應該因為這件事情遭到譴責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you said, both of you didn’t get along with each other …

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們剛結婚不久時，我們過得很開心。但問題就出在我的工作，我只是想要在台灣教葡萄牙文。但我的授課時數真的很少，所以我的工作成為我們相處之間的問題，我們為了這件事情一直爭吵，他不相信我已經盡了最大努力，我不知道要怎麼跟她說我的挫折。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	We just go back to the degree that you mentioned. When did you start you your program? Did you get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在102的春季課程開始的，那是一個為期兩年的課程。我必須在103年的12月完成課程。我並沒有完成我的課程，因為我有一個兼職工作，所以我時間不夠去做那些作業。就如同我之前所說，我的老婆並不支持我，我覺得我一直在靠我自己的能力去追求那些課程，我開始感到很疲倦而且挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So, you mean that the program is for two years. And you didn’t finish that program, what’s the reason?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我不能完成課程中的所有作業。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	What is the last registration semester of your program?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一個註冊學期是在103年。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If all you said is true, it supposed that you would not have any assignment after December 5 2012. The message sent between your colleague and you last six months after the semester, what’s the reason?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	恩，我沒有完成那個課程並不代表我想要停止精進我的語言能力。即使我沒有完成那個課程，我還是想要精進我的中文能力

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So, you meant that even if you failed to get that degree, you want to make your Chinese more fluent by yourself, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	沒錯，那就是我為什麼要請我同事幫忙的原因。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	You mean that your colleague is just a role of tutor, is that right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她並不只是一個家教而已，她也是我的好朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay for her? 

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我曾經試圖給她錢，但是她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay to her, why would she send that message for you even if in the mid-night. Is that beyond co-worker relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	就像我之前所說，她只是一個熱心助人的朋友。她運用很多時間來幫助我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	沒錯，我還在那裡教書。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is that colleague still in that cram school?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	沒錯，她仍然在那裏工作，但我們已經不再搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Does the prosecutor want to have more any evidence or witness?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena the witness of defendant’s colleague, Tsai Yan Wang. We want her to explain the background and purpose of that message.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Does the defendant want the court to find some evidences for you? 

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I just heard that the cram school took some steps for them. And they tried to persuade his colleague to leave the cram school. Can we check this? 

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you want the court to find some evidences for you? The situation is that you finished the program on December 5 2012. You should not have the excuses of doing homework for sending the message. Particularly, both of you sent the message for each other after 9:00 PM, it’s very doubted. Do you have any evidence for your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我無法想到有甚麼證據可以幫助我的案子，就如同我之前所說，我和我同事之間的簡訊只是平凡的簡訊而已。我只是想精進我的中文能力而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So, the next court day will be set at 4:30, in June 9 2014, and it will be the witness inquiry procedure. Please both of you should make it. If it’s necessary, both of you can have lawyers, is that clear?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白了。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	We just dismiss here. 

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	You have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will. (You do not have to make any statement against your will.)

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民或其他符合法律規定之資格，得請求法律服務。
en-US	You have the right to a lawyer. If your financial status falls under the poverty line, you are an aborigine, or meet other qualifications set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	You can ask the court to investigate any evidence,which may help you with your case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights? 

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparation procedure of adultery. The plaintiff, Yu Hua Chen, filed this case. The plaintiff suspect her husband, John Anderston, has a beyond co-worker’s relation with his co-worker of the cram school, and the plaintiff found some intimate messages in the defendant’s cell phone. In addition, the defendant will always make up reasons for going out in the with Wang Cai Yan and also has the tele-conference with her in the midnight. According to the information found by the plaintiff, she found that their relationship is beyond co-worker’s relationship. Therefore, she filed for this case. Defendant, your wife suspected you are having an affair with another, and she filed for the case of adultery.

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然是無罪的啊!

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the main purpose of this procedure is to seek out the detail information to find out whether the defendant is having an affaire with Cai Yan Wang and it might constitute the adultery, do you understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	 I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, I want to ask the plaintiff, how long have you married, and do you kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have already married for four years, and we do not have kid.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Do you marry your husband in Taiwan or in other country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan as a Portuguese teacher.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	During those years, did he teach Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we met, he was a Portuguese teacher, and after we married, he still taught Portuguese. But Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan; therefore his teaching hours are not stable. Sometimes he might did not have any class between one or two months. Because he wanted to make our financial status more stable, therefore he started to taught English. But his mother tongue is not English; therefore, he sought an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mention before that he sought an advanced degree, do you mean he studies a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Because he hoped to teach English in Taiwan, therefore, he have to get the degree of the TESOL. On the Internet, he found a distance learning program provided by California school. He did not have to go to the US, and can learn on-line. After he finishes the classes, he can get the degree. His plan is to find an English teacher job in Taiwan by getting an US degree.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Can you explain the relationship between your husband and the woman in this case?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in cram school. In the cram school, they have the system of a foreigner teacher partner with a Chinese teacher, and they are partners.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they are having an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I found that my husband started to stay at the cram school for a long time. I asked him many times “It is just a cram school, why did you have to stay there so long?” He told me that because he had to partner with a Chinese teacher, and they had to cooperate with each other. At first, I did not suspect he is having an affair with her. But after a while, I noticed that, my husband would get some phone calls after he came home. When he received those phone calls, he did not speak the phone directly in front of me, instead going to the study room. That is the reason why I checked the information in his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything strange in his cell phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	 I saw his phone calls always from one number, so I was curious about the text messages and I checked them. After I checked the messages, I found that he almost chatted with a woman everyday.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	I think it is okay to text messages, is anything wrong in the content?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If those messages’ content are normal, that will be okay. But he is a married man, how could he let a girl to text him some intimate messages? I have provided some content of the messages, I think they might in the investigation file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please check page 13, file one. There are some messages content, please check them. Are these your messages from your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對，這些是我電話中的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I have some question about the message content. The first message is from the cell phone 0958-932xxx at 9:50 p.m., on December thirty first, 2012. The content is 我非常想你 可以請你解釋一下嗎?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我同事發來的。我記得那陣子，我休了兩天的假。她可能有點擔心吧。這就是她發給我這封簡訊的原因。我同事在美國受過教育，他非常開放，這是她的講話方式啊!至於她稱呼我是她的愛人，這只是她的一個稱呼罷了。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that because the people was educated in the USA, and she is westernized, and she is open minded to express her feeling, so the name, my love, does not mean a lot?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	這只是普通朋友間很常見的稱呼，或者是表達你對你很親密朋友的關心罷了

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the previous line?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	我說啦，她很擔心我，我們是夥伴啊!當我請了兩天的假以後，她當然會開始想我阿。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You are saying that because of your two days off, she texted you this kind of message. Without your help in the work, she missed you a lot. Is that all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	這封簡訊就沒甚麼大不了的，內容是很普遍的， 這只是很單純的簡訊。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The next message was from the same cell phone at 11:55 p.m., on January thirteenth, in 2013.內容是我想要你在我身逼，甚麼時候才能在一起呢? Can you explain the content?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她發簡訊給我，只是為了告訴我功課的中文該如何表達的一句話

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Do you mean that she sent this message to you just to help you with your homework can you explain that?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	我太太之前有跟庭上報告過，我正在上遠距離教學。為了得到學位，我必須完成30學分，當然啦，我就必需完成一些功課或者是作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain that what is your master degree for?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是有關英語教學的。這個學位的課程內容有些是有關英語語言能力的、有些是有關文化跟英語教學。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you are saying that in your master degree, the main program is for English competence, but there are some culture classes?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，我記得課程裡有3門課程是有關文化溝通的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	Can you tell me the homework of the culture communication classes?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這門課裡，每個學生的作業都是因人而異的。以我自己為例的話，我在台灣想要當一名英文老師，為了達到這個目的，我需要證明我有足夠的語言能力，尤其是對中文的掌握。所以我的功課內容很多是有關中英語間的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Your plan is to teach in Taiwan. Therefore, you have to prove you have the Chinese competence. So you have to finish some assignments, and that is about translation between Chinese and English, is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	我還必須加強我的寫作和口語能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s go back to the next point. You said that is your homework, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	我記得這句話。當我拿到這句話的中文時，我不知道要怎麼把它翻成英文。你知道的，中文對外國人來說是很難辨識的，它們都長得一樣。我需要一些幫助，所以我就請我的同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯這句話，再把這句話寄給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You are saying that you gave your college the Chinese sentence, and she translated it into English and sent it back to you. Is that right? In other words, the content of this message is just a part of your assignment, is that right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	這封簡訊的內容，就只是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now, please check page 14 to 15 of file one, the content of all messages. Please check those messages. Are they all your assignments, and you ask your co-workers to help you?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	這些簡訊都只有一個目的，就是為了幫助我完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So, as for the accuse from you wife that you are having affair with Cai Yan Wang, what is your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了。我知道她覺得我對家庭的付出不夠。我想要強調，再我求學的這段過程，我太太一開始完成沒有支持我。她不希望幫助我完成我的學業，如果她願意幫助我的話，我根本就不需要請我的同事幫我。我覺得她應該為造成這種誤解負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you said, I think there might be some misunderstanding between you and your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們剛結婚時真的很甜蜜。但我的工作造成我們之間的問題，我試著在台灣教葡萄牙，但我的授課時數一直很不穩定，所以我的工作問題就造成我們兩個之間的不和，我們為了我的工作常常吵架。她不相信我已經近全力在工作了，我也不知道我要怎麼表達我己經…我的沮喪、我的難過

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s back to your master degree. When did you start your master degree? Did you finish? ….When was it?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始課程的。這是一個兩年的課程。我本來應該在2012年的12月拿到學位。可是我並沒有拿到學位，因為我必須在台灣做兼職工作，而我沒有很多時間來做我的作業。像我之前說的，我太太並不支持我。我覺得我在追求學位的時候是一個很孤單的過程，我覺得太疲累、太沮喪。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	Did you mean the program is a two-year program but you did not finish the course? Why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When was your last semester registration? 

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If you are telling the truth, the last day of your registration was December fifth, 2012. So after the day, basically you do no have any homework, is that right? Can you explain why you kept contacting with your co-worker after the last day of your registration for six months?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	恩..我沒有拿到學位，但不代表我不想增進我的中文能力。雖然我沒有拿到學位，我也想要練習我的中文，所以我一直自學。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even though you fail to finish the degree, but you still want to improve your Chinese and make you speak Chinese fluently?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，所以我才請我的同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So, the role of your co-worker is as your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，還是我一個貼心的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我有試著付她錢但是她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	So, if you did not pay her, why did she need to text you in the midnight when everyone is sleeping? Does that far beyond co-worker’s relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我才說他是一個很支持我的朋友。她用她自己私人的時間來幫助我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對，我還在那家補習班工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	And, does the co-worker, Cai Yan Wang, still work there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那家補習班工作，但我們現在已經不是夥伴的關係了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there any evidence you need to investigate or any witness to subpoena?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena Cai Yan Wang, who is still working at the Bo Yuan cram school, as a witness. We want her to explain the reason why she texted those messages, and explain the relationship between she and the defendant.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there any evidence you want the court to investing for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	 I heard that the cram school has do some action because of their relationship. And there even someone was trying to persuade Cai Yan Wang to leave the cram school. Is it possible to verify the truth?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there any evidence you want to court to investigate for you? The situation is your program was ended on December fifteenth, 2012. There is still no reason for you to keep texting messages with Cai Yan Wang for helping the homework. Especially, most of your messages are after nine o’clock, it is very suspicious. Do you have any evidence to prove your innocence?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我現在想不到有任何證據可以提供給法院來證明我的行為。我說過了，我和我同事間的簡訊互動是非常平常。我只是想要繼續學中文，並且增進我的中文能力。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So the next court will be at four o’clock p.m., on July ninth, 2014. The main purpose of the court is to examine the witness’s statements. Plaintiff and defendant please show up on that day. If necessary both of you can have your lawyers. Do you understand? 

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Okay, so the procedure ends here.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your tights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are going to discuss the adultery case. The plaintiff filed this case. The reason is that the plaintiff’s husband had the intimate messages with colleague in the cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate massages in her husband’s phone. Moreover, her husband often made up reasons for additional working in the cram school, and sometimes in the in the night………The plaintiff found the content in the messages and the behavior between them is beyond co-worker’s relationship. Defendant, your wife doubts that you have adultery, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我無罪答辯阿當然

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparing procedure, the main course is to ask the defendant and his colleague about the intimate messages. The aim is to find out if they constitute the adultery. Do both party understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long is your marriage?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	Our marriage last four years, we don’t have child.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you marry in Taiwan? Or abroad? 

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I acquainted with my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So I the past years, your husband’s job is teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we know each other at the very first time, he is a teacher who teaching Portuguese. After we married, he still teach Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hour is not very regular. Sometimes, there….will….are 1or2 months between jobs. to make the income more regularly, he changes to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he seeks an advanced degree. 

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	As you said, he want to seek a advanced degree. Is it mean he want to get the degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he want to teach in Taiwan, he wants to get the English teaching degree. And he found a distance learning program on the internet which is from the California. This program enable him to not to go to the America and still can get the learning program from distance learning. And after he…complete this program, he can get the degree. His plan is after he get the degree from the program, he can teach English in Taiwan. 

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what’s the relationship between the person he has the affair with

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleague in cram school. The cram school schedule a program which combine the Chinese teacher and foreigner teacher. And the woman is the Chinese teacher who partner with him. 

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did know they are in the adultery?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I found my husband usually stay in cram school for additional work. I had ask him many time:”it just a cram school, how could he stay there so long?” he told me that, he has to teach English …………………. At beginning, I didn’t doubt him. However, I found that after he went home, sometimes he will got the phonecall in night. When he got the phone call, he won’t talk in front of me; however, he went into the study room. It made me become doubtable ……….. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So what did you find in his telephone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone book, it appears a same number many times. So I am very curious about that, so I check his phone book. After I check her telephone. He sent the messages every day. 

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Even if he sent the messages every day. It’s normal, or if there any……………

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If these are common messages, it’s ok with me. However, he is married, how could that woman sent the intimate messages. I had provide their messages I the court. I think they are in the file. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	I am going to show you a file……….there are some contents of the message. Please check. Are these your messages?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是這是我手機的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	And now I will ask you some questions about the messages. The first one is in 9:30 pm, on 2012, Nonmember 31, from 0958932***. The content is “I really, my love.” What does it mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	喔那是從我同是那傳來的阿,我記得那天我休假了兩天,而他很擔心我發生什麼事了,這也就是為什麼他要傳簡訊給我,我同事是接受美國教育的,他是個很開放的人,這就是他講話的方式,他表達自己情感的方式,致於我們通常都稱對方…..

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	As you said, the one who sent the message was educated in America, so she is very open mined or westernized. So the way she express herself is more open minded. So the term “My Love” do not mean anything, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	當然阿,對我們來講,這就是對於好朋友之間的稱呼阿……………..

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	What about the message before that?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的阿,他就是很擔心我阿,我們是課程上的搭檔,當我休假兩天的時候他是真的很想我阿

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the woman sent these messages just because you didn’t go to work in these two days? Because without your help, she was very miss you. Is that all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對阿,這就是整個簡訊的重點,所以簡訊內容根本就不是什麼了的是

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	So the second message is from in 11:55 pm, on 2013, January 13. And this is from the same sender. The content …………….  What does this message mean? Why did she sent this to you?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他傳這封簡訊是教我怎麼用中文表達自己的情感

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Do you mean that the sender sent this message just because she wants to help you with your assignment?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太告訴你們的,我參加了一個碩士課程,在那個課程中,我必須完成三十個學分才能的到學位,所以當然我必須完成許多作業跟研究報告

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain what’s your degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我所受的課程是英語教學課程,那課程包括一些英語教學還有文化,語言能力相關的一些課

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So the degree you are going to get is about TESOL and about the culture communication, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對阿,救我記憶所及,我記得有三個課程都跟文化溝通有關

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what’s the assignment from culture communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這個課程作業會根據每個學生的不同有不一樣的作業,以我為例,我是一個想在台灣獲得英語教學碩士的人,在這個課程中我必須證明我自己的語言能力,而且我必須向這個課程證明我的中文能力,所以在這個課程中我所做的作業都跟中英翻譯有官

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the English degree you want to get ask you to prove your Chinese competence? So you have to complete the assignment about the culture communication, right? 

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對阿當然,同時我也必須精進我的說跟寫

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So let’s go back, so do you mean that these are your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對阿當我看到這些中文句子的時候我還不知道我要怎麼把它翻成英文,我想你們應該知道這些句子對外國人來講是很難去記得的,我需要別人的幫助,所以我請我的搭檔協助我,我請他幫我翻譯這些句子,然後請他寄給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	As you said, you ask the colleague to help with your assignment, so she translated the sentences to English and sent these to you, right? So in other saying, the messages are the answers from the assignments?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	這些簡訊都只是我作業的答案而已

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now we are going to show you the file one, the page 14-16, there are all the content of your messages. Please, check the content. Is that all the answer of your assignments which you ask your colleague to help you?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的這些簡訊內容全部都是為了協助我完成我的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So according to your wife’s ……………what’s your explanation? 

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得我太太想太多了,我知道他對於我養這個家有很多的疑問,我希望庭上可以了解,在我尋求我的碩士學位時,他從來都不曾幫助過我也不曾支持過我,他根本就不願意幫助我去完成我的學業,如果他有那麼易點院易幫助我的心的話,我今天就不用我同事幫我了,我覺得這一切都是因他而起

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, is there any unhappy thing between you both?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	一開始我們結婚的時候,我們的確有一段快樂的時光,但是問題是……我試著在台灣教葡萄牙語,但是我的授課時數真的一點都不夠,所以我的工作漸漸變成我們兩個之間最大的問題,我們為了這件事情爭吵不休,他不相信我,我為了這件是已經盡的最大的努力了,他真的不了解我有多麼挫折,而且我有多麼想要完成這件事情]

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	So let’s go back to the master degree program. When did your master program start? Is it finished? Or you are in program now?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年春天開始的,他是一個兩年的課程,我必須在12月12號之前完成他,但是我並沒有完成這個課程,是因為我同時我還有兼職工作,我並沒有時間去完成這個課程需要的作業跟報告,就像我說的我老婆從來就沒有支持過我,我認為我在追求我的碩士學位期間我很孤單,我覺得很累也很挫折

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So you mean that the program is a two years program? Why didn’t you complete this program?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	因為我無法完成每個課要求的

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	So what is the finished day of your last registration?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我這個註冊學期是2012年的秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	According to your statement, the finished day of your program is 2012.Dec 5. So after that day, you should not have any statement after that day, right? But the messages between Wang and you is last 6 months after you finished your master degree program. Why?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒有完成我的碩士學位並不代表我不想要精進我的中文能力阿,就算我沒有完成我的碩士學位,我還是想要精進我的中文能力,所以我還是請我的同事協助我

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that even you failed the master program, you still want to polish cjinese competence, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對阿,所以這就是我為什麼要請我同事幫我的原因

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So do you mean that your colleague is like you tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不只是我的家教也是我的好朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Do you pay?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有阿,但是我曾經說要付錢給他但他說不用

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	So if you didn’t pay her, why did she send you messages? Is she a diligent girl? Is that go beyond co-worker’s relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	就像我說的,他是我非常好的朋友,他用他所有的時間來幫助我,幫助我學習中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	So do you still teach English in that cram school? 

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對我還在教書

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is Wang still teaching there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	他也還在那教書阿,只是我們不是搭檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any further investigation? Or do you have to subpoena anyone?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena Wang in the 伯元cram school in the next court as the witness. I want her to explain the function of the messages and the relationship between the defendant. 

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, do you have any evidence that your want the court to investigate for this case?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard about that the cram school had take some actions to handle the relationship between them, And they had pursued the woman, Wang, to drop the job. Would the court check this?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate? The situation is that your master degree was finished in 2012, Dec 5. It is not the reason to explain the behavior between you and Wang. Particularly, your communication was ….at 9 pm. It was very strange. Do you have any evidence which can help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我不認為法庭可以為我找到什麼證據幫助我,就像我說的我跟我同事之間的溝通是非常正常的,我只是想要精進我的中文能力而且持續的學習

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court is set to……….4:30 pm, on Jane 9, 2014 as the………… plaintiff and defendant, both of you have to come. If you need…..according to your needs, you can hire the lawyer. 

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白了

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your right?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the investigatory procedure for the adultery. The… the plaintiff, Yu-Huwa Chen, has press…press the case. The reason why he filed this case is because she think his…her husband have too… have a very… um… have a very intimate relationship with his crime…crime-school (cram school, 發音不對) co-worker. And plaintiff have found some very intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. And plus, the defendant… her husband is always, er, usually will find some reason for staying in the workplace, or find some excuse go out… go out with this…co-worker? Or use…or use teleconference. And all these information that the plaintiff has collected is…has proved that the relationship between her husband and his co-worker is beyond the average coworker relationship. So, she filed the case. Defendant, your wife think you have a affair with someone else, so she’s want to press a charge for you…press a charge of the adultery. What do you think?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然是無罪開釋。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s court, we are… we will mainly focus on… asking the…asking the communication details between the husband and this co-worker. The purpose of this… of today’s court is to try to find out whether or not that the… that the defendant had a real… had a real adultery with…with this, his co-worker. Both of you understand… what we are going to happen today?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I do.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you been married with your husband? And did you have any child… did you have any kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We’ve been married for four years, and we have no children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	 Did you get married… did you got married in Taiwan? Or in the foreign country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, when he first arrived Taiwan, he wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So then in the past few years, is what he did for living? …….teach, teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he keep doing that, he kept doing that……teaching Portuguese. But the Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hour is not very stable. Sometimes the period between jobs will be one or two months. So…after that, he want to have a regular income, so he started to teach… so he started to teach English……he wanted to start teach English. But the English is not his mother tongue, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he wants to… he wants… he wants an advanced degree? Is that he… is that means… is that mean he tried to study a degree in Taiwan

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he needed is something related to English teaching. He find a distance learning program on the net. So he don’t… he didn’t have to go to American, America to learn the thing. He can get this degree through distance online learning. So after all the program subject he had learn, he can get his degree. His plan was that through this American degree that he can found a job in Taiwan to teach English.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So, what is the relationship between your husband and this co-worker he’s having affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-worker in the cram school. The cram school had the teaching style that the Chinese teacher will partner with a foreign teacher, and that co-worker was… is Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	So how did you know about this affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	 At first, I just noticed that my husband always stay in the cram school to do over-work, I think. I had asked him so many times: it’s just a cram school, how did you have so many works to do? He told me that because this partner teaching, he has to discuss with his partner a lot. At first, I had no doubt. But after a while, I found that he would always get some phones after he got home. And when he got these phones, he won’t talk… he would not talk in front of me, he would go to our study room to take these calls. That’s why I started to doubt the situation. That’s why I checked his phone book.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	 In the phone book, is there anything unusual? 

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	His record, there’s a number keep showing… kept showing up. So I got curious, so I checked his messages. After that, that’s when I found that he almost have these text messages with this girl, co-worker, everyday.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	It’s just the message, is that serious? Is there improper in these messages? 

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it’s just a normal message, then nothing will matter. But he’s a married man! How could he let the other sent these so intimate message… intimate sentence to him? I had provided some messages in my evidence to the court. I think it’s all in there.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please see the record p.13. Here are several messages from your cellphone, please look at it, defendant. Is this from your smartphone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對，這是從我手機裡拿出來的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I’m going to focus on these messages and have several questions for you. The first message is… was dated back to 2011, Nov. 31st, in the… 9:15 in the evening, and it’s from 0958932xxx. (後面翻成中文了囧)

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是一個我的同事傳給我的。我記得那個時候我請了兩天假。她有點擔心。這就是為什麼他要傳這封簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，她的思想非常開放。那就是她講話和表達感情的方式。那至於”我的愛”，我們就是這麼稱呼所在意的人。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean this message sender… because she was… was in the United State, so she’s more westernized? So he…so her way to show her express… to express his emotions is more… open? So, “my love” didn’t mean anything, is that right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	當然沒有啊。這就只是兩個感情很好的朋友，或者是很關心彼此的朋友之間的表達方式阿。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	So the former sentence she said?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的，她很擔心我，我們是工作上的夥伴。我請假兩天，她當然會想我啊。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean, she sent these messages just because you took two days off? Without your help in the class, she missed you a lot, is that so?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對，最主要就是那個概念，簡訊內容並不重要。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message, is sent in 2012, Jan. 13th, and is in evening 11:15…11:55, and is from the same person. (後面又翻成中文了orz) Can you tell me what these means? Why would she say something like this?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這封簡訊給我，主要是為了表示…主要是為了表達……怎麼用中文的方式表達。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she sent you these messages to help you on your assignment?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太曾經跟庭上所講過，我正在學習一個美國學位…一個碩士學位。在這個學程裡面，我被要求要完成三十個

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you just explain what exactly you’re study for you master program? For you master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的學位是英語教學。在這個學位裡面，主要是教有關英語教學，但是也會參雜著有關英語能力的學習，以及文化。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you mean you’re getting a TESOL degree, but that can include some English competence, is that right? ……some course about the culture, not English competence.

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，我記得至少有三門課是有關於文化和溝通。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	In these culture and communication courses, what assignments did you have?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	對每個學生來說，文化與溝通功課可能…對每個學生來說，都不一樣啊。就以我自己來舉例，我是一個在台灣試圖教…取得英語教學證明的外國人。為了證明我的能力，我必須證明我的中文能力。所以我有很多中英互翻譯的作業。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean because you wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so this degree ask you to prove your ability to use… Chinese? So you have to finished the assignment, and this assignment included sentence translation, is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對。而且我還被要求要加強我的口說和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So back to the former sentence… the former line, you said this is your assignment, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我記得這個句子。當我拿到這個中文句子的時候，我不知道怎麼把他翻成英文。你知道，有些中國字對外國人來說是很難認的。我需要一些幫助，所以我請我同事幫忙。我請她幫我翻譯這個句子，然後傳簡訊給我…傳答案給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean because you asked her how the sentence was said in…you send her the sentence in Chinese, and she translated it into English for you, and send you the answer, is that right? So this message is an answer for your assignment?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，那封簡訊只是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	And now please see the p.14 to 16 in the record. Please see the content. Are these all because you ask for help to your assignment, so the other person sent these to you?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，這些簡訊全都是為了我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So back to the point that you wife said you have an affair with your co-worker, Tsai-yian Wang, what’s your saying?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的事對這件事想太多了。我知道她對於支撐這個家的能力並不是非常滿意。但我希望法院…我希望庭上知道，在我的學習過程中，她從來沒有支持過我。她根本就不願意幫我完成我的學位。如果她能多支持我一點的話，我就不用向我同事求助了。我覺得她才是這整起誤會需要被…最需要…最主要負責的人。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	So according to you, I think…it seems that there are some friction… friction… fraction between you and your wife

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們剛結婚的時候，確實是一段好時光。但工作是我…是一個很大的問題。我想在台灣教葡萄牙文，但沒辦有有固定的授課時數，所以我的工作就變成了我們兩個之間的問題。我們為了這件事不知道已經吵了幾次架了。她不相信我已經盡了我最大的努力。她完全沒有辦法理解我所遇到的挫折以及我所遇到的問題。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	OK. Back to the master degree, the program you just mentioned. Can you tell me when your program begin? Is it end?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2010年的春天開始課程。那是個兩年的課程。我應該要在……2012年的12月之前完成課程。但是我並沒有如期完成，因為我…因為我一直在工作，所以我沒有辦法完成我的作業。就像我所說的，我的太太不怎麼支持我。我覺得我只有一個人在為學位奮鬥。我太累而且也太挫折了。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean you… you used to be a two-year program, and you failed to finish it. Why was that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法上完所有必需…要求的課程。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	 So your last registration semester, when did it end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一個註冊的學期是…2012的秋季班。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So if what you said was true… everything you said is true, your last course should be end at 2012, Nov. 15th. After that, you should not have any assignment, is that right? But your assignment text between you and your co-worker, kept… continued six months after your courses ended, how is that so?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒有完成那個課程，並不代表我不想增進我的中文能力…我的語言能力呀。雖然我沒有完成指定課程，但我還是想增進我的中文能力，所以我決定自修。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even you failed to finish that master degree program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，這就是為什麼我請我同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So this co-worker is playing a role that can call…can be called your…mentor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是個家教，她還是個真誠的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有。我曾經提供過這個想法，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	So, if you didn’t pay her, then why would she still send these message at the hour, at this late hour that she supposed to be rest, to be sleeped, to you? Is that beyond the co-worker obligation?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	就像我說的阿，她是一個非常真誠、非常支持的朋友。她利用她自己的私人時間來幫助我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teaching English at that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對，我還在那裏工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	And this co-worker, Tsai-yian Wang, still work here?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	對，她還在那裏教書，但我們現在不是搭檔。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Is there any person or investi…investi… evidence that the prosecutor want to do a further investigation? 

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope the court can call this Tsai-yian Wang as the witness to the court. Let her explain the true message behind these texts and why… and why she write…she wrote these messages to him.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, is there anything the court to do the further investigation for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had some action because of their relationship because of…because both of them. And they even try to persuade Tsai-yian Wang to leave the work. Is it possible to confirm this information to…to that cram school?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there anything you want to court to do the further investigation for you? Now here’s the thing, your degree, your program has already end at 20…2012, Dec. There is really no reason for you to say that your message is because she’s helping you to do your assignment. Especially your message usually were sent after 9 pm. And this is something normal people won’t… wouldn’t do. Do you have any evidence can help this case.

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我覺得庭上沒有甚麼可以為我調查的證據了。就像我說的，我和我同事之間的關係非常簡單，只想增進我的語文能力，學習中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So, we will dated at 2014, June 9th and in afternoon 4:30 to start to ask the witness. …to starting the procedure asking witness. Plaintiff and the defendant, please be here. If it is necessary, you can have your attorney here, do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	So today’s court is adjourned.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	Today we are here for the preparation procedure of case number 2887, adultery.

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國103年5月27日。」

zh-TW	2.你有權選任法定辯護人，若為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民或其他符合法律規定之資格，得請求法律服務。

en-US	You have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you with your case. 

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are her for the preparation procedure for adultery. The plaintiff sued up for the case. It is because her husband John Anderston is in a relation with a teacher from his colleague. The plaintiff found some intimate messages from her husband’s phone. Plus, her husband, the defendant, usually have some excuses to stay in the cram school with his colleague王彩燕, and sometimes has some tele-conferencing. What the plaintiff has collected of the information are actually beyond the colleagues’ relationship. As a result, the plaintiff sued up. Defendant, your wife thinks you have affairs with you colleague. What’s your plead?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
en-US	當然沒有阿

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’ preparatory procedure, we are here for asking the messages between the defendant and his colleague. The purpose is to understand the defendant and his colleague really have intimate messages and even adultery. Do both parties of you fully understand your rights?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long do you marry your husband. Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have married for 4 years, and we have no kids.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you marry you husband in Taiwan or foreign countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the past a few years, did he only work for teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he is a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued his teaching. However, in Taiwan, Portuguese is not a famous English language, which is like English, so his teaching hours is not stable. Sometimes he will have even a period between jobs about two months. Afterwards, in order to make stable income, he started to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English. As a result, he seeks an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean he want to study a program in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, he has to have a degree of English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California on the internet. So he don’t have to go to school but can have an on-line learning at home. After he finished all he course, he can got the master degree. His plan is that if he got the master degree in Taiwan, then he can also teach English. So what is the relationship between him and the person he has affair with?

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	They are colleagues of cram school.

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	The cram school plans a foreign teacher and a Chinese teacher working together for a program, and the woman is his partner. 

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know they have some affairs?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I just noticed that my husband usually stayed at cram school for over work. I have asked him for many times. It is just a cram school. How could he work so much? He told me because he needs to partner with the Chinese teacher, so they need a lot of time to communicate and discuss. At first, I really didn’t think too much. But later I found he usually got some phone calls after he was home. And he usually picked up his phone in the study room rather with me. It seems like he wants to hide something, so I check his phone book.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Do you find anything weird in his phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone records, I found there is a number showing up for many times, Because I am curious about that, I check his test messages, too. After I checked his text messages, I found they text each other almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Just texting, it is not that serious. Is the content not appropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If that is just a common message, it’s okay. But he has got married, how could he text the kind of messages with other woman? I have provided some messages to the court. I think they are in the files.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please show the evidence record, number 13. Here are some text messages. Defendant, please check it. Are these from your phone’s text messages?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這是我手機裡面的簡訊內容

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I have a few questions about these messages. The first message is from 0958-932-XXX at 9:50 PM on December 31th, 2012, is that right? The content shows “I really miss you, my love.” What did it mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	那只是我同事傳給我的訊息，我記得那時候我請了兩天假，她只是太擔心了而已，這大概就是她為什麼會傳這樣的簡訊給我的原因，我同事是在美國受教育的，所以她比較開放一點，這就是她平常的說話方式跟表達方式，至於所提到的「我的愛」，只是我們平常用來稱呼我們比較親密在乎的人而已

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean the sender is that westernized because she stayed in United State for many years and the way she expresses herself is quietly open as well. So “my love”, this word means nothing. Is that right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	對阿，這在好朋友之間是很常見的，而且我們又是這麼熟的朋友

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	What about the sentence she just mentioned?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就如同我所說的，她只是擔心我，因為我們是工作上的同事阿，所以我沒去上班幾天，她想我也是滿正常的

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean that she sent this message to you just because you are not for work for two days. Because without your assistance, so she missed you a lot. That’s all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對阿就是這樣，簡訊內容根本沒有什麼問題啊

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message is from the same number at23:55 PM on January 13th in 2013. The content of the message is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this message mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳這封簡訊的目的只是要問我在中文裡面要怎麼表達這個句子的意思

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean she sent this message to you just to help you finish your homework? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	在我太太提告之前，我正準備要完成我的碩士學位，在這課程當中，我必須修滿30個學分才能結業，所以很自然地我當然必須完成一些練習還有作業阿

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain what’s your master degree about?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我學的是英語教學，在這課程當中，大部分跟英語教學有關，但有些也跟文化還有語言能力有關

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So what you got your master degree is a TESOL, and there are also some culture programs, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是阿，我記得當中至少有三門課程是跟文化有關係的

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So this kind of culture program… what kind of homework will it has?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	關於文化與溝通這方面，可能會因為不同學生而因人而異，拿我自己為例子，我是打算在台灣尋求英語教學資格，為了證明跟表達我自己能力，我必須展現出我對中文的掌握能力，因此在我的作業當中有很多中英互相翻譯的作業

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean you want to teach English in Taiwan so that the program ask you to prove the language competence of Chinese, is that right? So you have to finish some homework, and the homework is about sentence translating. Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對阿就是這樣，而且我也同時被要求要精進我自己的聽跟口說能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	OK that’s go back to what we just mentioned. You mean that this is your homework right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對阿，我還記得那個句子，當我拿到這個中文句子時，我實在不知道怎麼去翻譯，你知道有些中文的字對外國人來說是非常難去理解的，我需要一些協助所以我就請我的同事幫忙，我請她幫我翻譯並把句子傳給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You meant that you ask your colleague to tell you what’s the meaning, and she translates into English form and send it to you? In other words, the message is just the content of your homework?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，這封訊息真的只是我作業的答案

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	That’s take the documentary, the file from page 14 to page 16. Here are some contents of the messages. Please check these messages. Are these all out of your homework so you seek for your colleague’s help and she sent them back to you?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對，所有的簡訊內容都只是幫助完成我的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So what’s your explain about your wife charged you and your colleague王彩燕have an affair?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了，我知道她覺得我能力不足以養整個家，我希望庭上了解，在我開始修課之後的所有期間，她從未提供我任何協助，她根本沒有想要幫助我完成學位的意思，如果她願意幫助我的話，我根本不需要向我的同事求助，我覺得她應該為這些所有誤會道歉

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your words, it seems like you and your wife have some misunderstanding and even unhappy?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們剛結婚時，一開始我們確實過得很開心，但問題出在我的工作，我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但沒有辦法有穩定的教學時數，所以我的工作變成我們之間的問題、導火線，我們為這件事情吵了很多次，她不肯相信我已經盡全力了，我也沒有辦法讓她了解我所面臨的困境和無力

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Ok let’s go back to your master degree you just mentioned. When did you start your master degree? Did it end already? 

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2010年的春季開始上課的，我必須要在12月22日完成這個課程，我並沒有完成我的學業，因為我同時在打工，而且沒有時間做我的作業，

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean the term of this program is two years long, but you didn’t finish it. Is that right?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法修完所有的課程

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	So when did you finish the course?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一次註冊的時間點是2012年的秋季

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you just mentioned, you course ended on December 5th in 2012, which means you won’t have any homework afterwards. Is that right? But you and your colleague still have some inappropriate messages after you finish your course for six months. What does that mean?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	即使我沒有繼續修課了不代表我沒有繼續增進我語言能力的意思，為了增進我的中文能力，我只能夠靠自己繼續練習下去

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean even you didn’t finish the program you still want to sharpen your Chinese skills?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，這就是為什麼我請我的同事幫忙

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleague is just like your tutor, tight?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，她也是我的真心朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我曾經想過但是被她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her anything, why did she send these messages to you so late? Was that too much for a colleague doing this for you?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	這也是為什麼我說她是一個…很挺我的朋友阿，她用她自己的個人時間來幫助我學習中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still teaching in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是的，我還在那裡上班

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	What about your colleague, 彩燕王? Is she still working there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她還在那邊工作，但我們已經沒有再一起搭檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any further questions or any evidence that you want to ask?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena on 彩雲王, who works for the cram school, and come here to get some information. I would like to understand the background of these text messages between the defendant and his colleague.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Do you want the court to help you investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had some actions against their affairs. And even the cram school officers tried to ask 彩燕王 to leave the job. Can the court check this from the cram school?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you? Your work has already ended at December 5th 2012, you have no excuses to text messages with 彩燕王 for finishing assignments. Especially your text interactions are at night after 9 o’clock. That’s weird. Do you have any evidence that can help you with the case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到任何庭上可以代替我去調查的證據，就如同我所說，我同事跟我之間的傳訊內容就真的這麼單純而已，我只是希望她能過增進我的中文能力，然後幫助我繼續學習中文下去

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So the next court date will at 4:30 PM on June 9th in 2014 for the inquiry procedure of the witness. The plaintiff and the defendant, both of you need to show up. If necessary, both of you can have a lawyer.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白了

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	OK then we will end the court here

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case, case number 2887.

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國103年5月27日。」

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The plantiff, Yu-Hua Chen filed for this case mainly because her husband John Anderson has a very intimate relationship with his colleague in cram school…from a cram school. The plaintiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cell phone. And…in addition, the defendant often say that…he is going to work extra hours or do tele-conferencing with his colleague, Tsai-Yian Wang. The messages which the plaintiff found…was not only just colleague relationship. As a result, she filed for the case. Defendant, your wife filed an adultery case against you. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然是無罪。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	Today this procedure…we’re going to confirm the details of the messages of the defendant and his colleague. We would like to make sure that if they really committed adultery and constitute the crime of adultery. Do both of you understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	 I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you and your husband been married? Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years. We don’t have children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you and your husband get married in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	My husband and I met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and taught Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in the past few years, is his job teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued teaching Portuguese. However, in Taiwan Portuguese is not that popular, so his teaching hours was not…teaching hours were not that stable. Sometimes he has periods between jobs for like…one or two months. After that, in order to get more stable income, he decided to start teaching English. However, his mother tongue is not English…he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You said that he was going to seek for an advanced degree, do you mean that he’s going to study a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Because he hoped that he could teach English, he had to get a degree of teaching…English teaching. He found a distance learning program on the internet which is provided by California. In this case, he didn’t have to go to the United States. He only had to do online learning. After he got all the credits, he can get…master degree. His plan is that after he got this English teaching degree, he can teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what is his relationship with this person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are colleagues…in cram school…in the cram school he works for. The plan of the cram school is that foreign teacher partner with Chinese teacher, and that woman is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know that they committed…he committed adultery?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	In the beginning, I just found that he stayed at school to work extra hours. I asked him several times: it’s just an English cram school, what is the need of working extra hours? He told me that because he had to partner with the Chinese teacher, he had to spend much time to communicate…spend much time communicating. In the beginning, I didn’t doubt him at all. However, I found that he often had some phone calls after work. When he got the phone call, he would never talk in my presence, he would go to the study room. This…I doubt because of this, so I checked his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	What did you see in his cell phone then? Something unusual…anything unusual?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I often see the same number in his calling record, so I was quite curious and looked at his messages…checked his messages. After I checked his cell phones, I found that he messaged with this…with a woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	What is big about sending messages? Is the content not appropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	 If it’s something very usual, I won’t really care, but he’s a married man, how can he let the other one send messages which is a bit…vague? In the past, I have already provided some contents of the messages. They should be in the documents.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please look at page 13 of the document. Here are some contents…here of the contents of the messages. Defendant, please take a look. Is these…are these the messages in your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，是我簡訊的內容。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	So now I’m going to focus on the content of the messages…I’ll ask you some questions. The message is send by the phone number 0958-932*** in November 31st, 2012 at 9:50 PM. The content is “我非常想念你,”What does this mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	就是我同事傳的啊。我記得那個時候我請了兩天假，她有點擔心。那就是為什…所以她才傳這樣的簡訊給我。我的同事是在美國受教育的，所以很開明…開放，那就是她講話的方式。就是…「my love」這樣的詞就只是我們叫我們關心的人的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that this woman stayed abroad, so her thoughts are more westernized? And the way her…she expressed her feelings is more…open-minded? So the phrase “my love” doesn’t really mean anything, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	對啊，那是好朋友之間，或是很關心彼此的朋友表達的方式…稱呼彼此的方式。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the previous sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	我就說了，她…她很關心我，我們是工作上的好夥伴。當我請假兩天，他很自然地就會想念我啊

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	 You mean that the woman sent you this message just because you took two days off? Because you didn’t…you weren’t there to help her in class, she missed you? Is that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊，內容就是這樣子，根本沒什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	So let’s look at the second message which is sent at 11:55 PM, January 13th, 2013 by the same person. 內容是我想要你在我身邊，我們什麼時候可以在一起？What does this mean? Why do you have that sentence in your cell phone?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫那句話是想告訴我一句中文該怎麼說。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she sent you this message because she was helping you finishing your homework. What does this mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我妻子提到的，我現在正在修碩士課程。在那個學位中，我要修完三十個學分才能拿到學位。那我當然就要…完成一些練習、作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you please explain which program you are studying?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士課程是英語教學。這個課程主要就是英語教學，然後還會有一些文化語言…文化方面的東西還有語言能力等等。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you’re studying for the TESOL program, so there are some cultural lessons in that program, is that true? Is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，我記得至少有三門課是跟文化與溝通有關的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what kind of assignments do you have from these cultural communication course?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	對每個學生來說，這堂課的作業都不太一樣。我以我自己來說的話，我是在台灣然後想要成為一位英文老師。為了要拿到這個學位、表示我有能力，我也要證明說我的中文是很好的。所以很多我作業的內容都是中英翻譯的句子。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you plan to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove that you have sufficient Chinese competence, is that right? So you have to finish some assignments in class, and these assignments are about translating sentences…between Chinese and English, right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對啊，我也被要求就是要增進我的口語表達和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to the previous sentence. You said that they’re your assignments, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對啊，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這些…就是中文的句子的時候，我不知道英文怎麼講。你知道，有些中文字對外國人來說實在是太難了。我需要一些幫忙，所以請我的同事幫我。我請她翻譯一下那個句子，然後傳簡訊給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So you said that you didn’t know the meaning of that sentence, so you ask your colleague to send you the translation in English by message, is that right? So the content of the message is the answer of your assignment, right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，那個就是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	So how about…let’s look at the content of the messages on page 14 to 16 on the document. Please check the content. Is these messages sent by your colleague because you need help doing your assignment?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，所有的內容都是我要做作業所以傳的。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So what do you want to say to your wife saying that you committed adultery with your colleague, Tsai-Yan Wang.

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得她真的想太多了，關於這件事情。我知道她對我…對我照顧家庭的狀況不滿意。我想要讓法院知道的是，從我說我想要修這個學位開始，她就沒有提供任何的支持。她根本就不想要幫助我完成學位。如果她沒有這麼…如果她支持我的話，我就不會去尋求我同事的幫助。我覺得會產生這些誤會都是她的問題。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your words, the relationship between you two is a bit unpleasant, is that right?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	剛開始結婚的時候，確實相處得還不錯。但是問題就是…但是問題就是我的工作。我試著要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是授課時數就是不夠。然後我們兩個的關係就是因為我的工作變得不太好。我們為了這件事情…常常為了這件事情爭吵。她不相信我已經盡我所能了。我沒有辦法讓他了解我的…有多沮喪然後遇到的困難是什麼。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	OK, let’s go back to the master degree you were talking about. When did you start studying for your master degree. When did it end? Did you get the degree already?…Have you got the degree already?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我本來是在2010年的春天開始的…一開始。那是兩年的課程。我本來是應該是在2012年的12月完成這個學位。我之所以沒有準時拿到是因為我要工作…然後沒有辦法有時間去寫我的作業。就像我剛剛說的，我的老婆一直都沒有很支持我。我覺得我根本就是一個人在追求這個學位，我覺得很累很沮喪。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You said that this was a two-year program, and you didn’t finish it. Why is that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成所有的課程…修完所有的課程。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When did the semester you last registered ended?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	恩…是在2012月四月。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So…as you said, according to your saying, the course ended on December 5th, 2012. After that…you won’t have…you didn’t really have assignments, right? But the messages between you and colleague continued until…continued for another six months. Why is that?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我或許沒有想要把那個課程修完，但不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。就算我沒有修完那個學位，我還是想要增進我的中文能力，所以我開始自學。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even though you haven’t finished your English, you still want to let your Chinese become more fluent, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，所以為什麼我請我同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So this colleague is somehow like…a tutor of yours, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不是只是一個家教而已，而且還是一個真正的好朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我曾經要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	 If you didn’t pay her, why does she send messages in the middle of the night with such effort? Is that beyond colleague…relationships between colleagues?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我說這個朋友很支持我啊。她用她自己的時間幫助我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English at that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對，我還在那裡工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is this woman, Tsai-Yan Wang your colleague, still working there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	對啊，她還在那裡工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you want to investigate any further evidence?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena Wang…Tsai-Yan Wang, the colleague of the defendant, who works at Bo-Yuan Cram School. I hope that she can explain her relationship with the defendant and in what situation…under what circumstances are these messages sent.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Defendant, do you…what other evidences do you want us to investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has taken some action concerning the relationship between them. And the cram school even asked the woman, Tsai-Yan Wang, to leave her job. Is it possible for…to check with the cram school about this matter?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Now, defendant, do you want to ask the court to investigate any evidence for you? The situation is…you have already completed…the courses have already been completed on December 5th, 2012. There…it is not acceptable that doing assignment is an excuse for Tsai-Yan Wang sending messages to you. Especially the time you send messages is always after 9 PM, that is quite doubtful. Do you have evidence which can help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到任何法庭可以為我調查的證據。就像我說的，我們傳簡訊的原因非常簡單，我只是想要增進我的語言能力，然後繼續學中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So…the next court will be set at 4:30 PM, June 9th, 2014. We will inquire the witnesses. Plaintiff, defendant, both of you please come to the court. If it is necessary, you can both have lawyers, is that OK?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	OK, this will be the end of this preparatory procedure.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparation procedure. The plaintiff had filed the case mainly because her husband John Anderston had intimate relationship with his co worker and the plaintiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cell phone. Her husband always stay late at the cram school or tele-conferencing with his co worker at midnight. The behavior had already beyond co worker relationship .So she filed the case. Defendant, your wife suspect you of violating the crime law of adultery. What is your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparation procedure, we are going to ask questions about the relationship between the defendant and the co worker. The purpose is to find out whether the defendant has violated the criminal crime which is adultery and……..do the both parties understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long has you been married with your husband? Do you have a child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married ofr 4 years and we don’t have a child.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	So Did you married your husband in Taiwan or at other countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We meet ,…I met mu husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan because he wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the past years, his job is a Portuguese teacher, isn’t he? 

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a language in Taiwan that many people want to learn so his teacher hour is not stable. Sometimes he will have a period between jobs and the period may aim up to one or two months. So… hu… he started to teach English because he wants to have a more stable income. However, his mother tongue is not English so he decided to seek an advanced degree class for English.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that he would like to seek an advanced degree, do you mean that he want a degree n Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No , because he wanted to teach English , so what ..the degree he need is TESOL which means teaching English for speakers of other language .he found a distance teaching program in America …..in California, America on the internet. So he could finish the program by online learning,,, without …. He didn’t have to fly to America. After he finished the program, he could get a master degree. His plan was to … to get a degree by.. by finish finish …the program.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what is the relationship between the husband and the co- worker.

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are classmates in the cram school.The cram school provide teachers both Chinese teachers and foreign teachers. And the woman is a partner with my husband in the cram school.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	Hw do you know they have intimate relationship?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	First I found that my husband always stay late at the cram shoo. I asked him many times that it was just a English cram school why did he stay so long in the school? He told me that he had to partner the Chinese teacher, the woman so they have to corporate with each other, there are many things to be dealed. At first I did not doubted him. But after some time, I found that he always pick some calls after he came home. And he didn’t pick up the phone in form of me, he usually go to the study room for picking the phones. Then so I suspect.. those are the reasons I suspect him. So I checked his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything unusual in this cell phone.

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I saw one number appeared form time to time. I was curious about that so I checked his text messages too. After I checked that I found he almost has text messages with that woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Though they are text messages… that are fine right? Or the content is not appropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it is just a normal message, that will be fine. But he is a married man. How could he let a woman send intimate messages to him? I had provided some messages content that they should be in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please check investigatory file 1 page13In this file, here are some messages record, defendant, please checkArte these same messages with those messages in your phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對這是我手機裡的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I am going to ask some questions about those messages.The first text message was send on 9:50 in the evening on 11/31,2012. Form a number which is 0958-932===. The content is 我非常的想你 請你解釋這是什麼意思

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這次我一個同事發的 我記的那天 我休了兩天假 她是很擔心吧 所以她才會那封寄簡訊給我 我同事在美國受教育 她很開放 那是他講話表現 至於我的愛 那就是我們對我們關心的人的稱呼

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean the person who sends this message had stayed in the US so she is westernialized? And she is open-minded in expressing herself her emotions. So these words “my love did not mean a lot, isn’t it?”

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	這在好朋友之間的使用很正常

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the previous sentence she type?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的 他很關心我 我們是公事上的夥伴 當我休了兩天假的後 他很自然就想我拉 

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean she send this message to you just because you were  you took two days off? Because without your corporation or assistance, she missed you? is that all? 

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對這就是簡訊就沒什麼 內容很正常

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was send to you at 11:55 in the evening, 1/31, 2013. It was also form the same number. 內容是我想要你在身邊 我們什麼時候才能真正在一起 please explain it? Could you tell me why she send it to you?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫那封簡訊是為了告訴我中文作業該如何表達

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean she send this message to you mainly for helping you with your assignment, what do you mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太已經告訴法官 我正在參加一個含授課程 在那個城裡我被一球要修滿302個學分 我才能結業 當然我也需要做一些練習還有作業

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you explain what are you studying for your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是英語教學 在這個學程裡有一些是關於英語教學 文化還有一些是語言能力的

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So the degree you are taking is English teaching but you still have some culture communication lessons? Is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對 我記得至少有三堂課程是跟文化溝通有關的

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So could you tell me what assignment was given in this culture and communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	每個學生的文化溝通作業不盡相同 以我來說 我是一個在台灣的學生 而且我想要拿到 英語教學的學位   為了達到這個目標 我必須展現我的語言能力 由其是中文的掌握 所以我的很多作業是關於中文英文的翻譯

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean because you plan to teach English in Taiwan so the master degree asks you ti have some certificate for the language competence is that right? So you have to finish some assignment and the assignment is about Chinese and English translation, is that right? 

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對 沒錯 我還被要求要加強我的寫作和口語能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Ok lets go back to the question that you said it was your assingmnet

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對我記得那句話 當我拿到這個句子 我不知道要怎麼把它翻成英文你知道 對於外國人來說有些中文字很難理解 我需要一些幫助 所以我請我的同事幫我 我請她幫我翻譯那些話而且用簡訊寄給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean you asked her to translate it for you, so she sent it in message to you, is that right? So the message is only the answer for the translation question?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊的內容就是我翻譯題的答案

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	And now please check investigatory file 1 page 14-16 All of these content. Please check this content. All of these message are sent on the purpose ofhelping you with the homework so you have got the messages. 

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對 所有這些簡訊目的都是為了完成我所有的作業

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So as for the suspect that your wife suspect you to have a affair with 王彩華 what will you say about that?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太想太多了 我知道他對於我養家的能力不是很滿意我想要讓法院知道的是 它在我一開始參加這個課程時 一點都不支持我 她跟本不願意幫助我完成我的學位 如果她能更支持我一點 我就不用去問我的同事要答案了 我覺得她要為全部的誤解負責任

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you just said  I thought you may have some fights with your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們婚姻一開始的時候 我們的確曾有過一些很好的時光但我的工作一直是個問題 我試著在台灣蕉葡萄牙文 但工作時數一值不是很穩定 之後我的工作變成我們吵架的原因 我們之間的問題我們會這是三不五時就會吵架  他不相信我已經盡力了 而且我沒有辦法壤她知道我的挫折還有沮喪 

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Ok now let’s turn back to the degree you just mentionedWhen did you start the program did you get the degree?When will it end?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010 春天開始這個課程那是一個兩年的課程 我本來在12/22應該完成這個課程 我沒有完成學位因為我有再打工 所以我沒有完成課程所要求的作業  就像我說的 我太太一直沒有很支持我 我感覺我是自己再硬撐著拿到那學位 我後來變得很累而且很挫折

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean the program is a two year term program but in the end you did not finish it, why ?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法達到課程要求

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	So when did the last semester that you registered end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期結束在2012年秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So if you are telling the truth, the end of the semester is at 12/5,2012 after that you would not have any assignment for the course. But the messages between you and the co-worker still continue for 6 months after you finished ….. you stop the program.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒有拿到學位 但不代表我不想要提升我的語言能力 雖然我沒有拿到學位但我仍想要讓我的中文變好所以我自己學中文

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that although you did not complete the degree but you still want to upgrade your Chinese language ability so that you could speak a more fluent Chines, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對 這就是為什麼我請我同事幫忙

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the co worker is as a tutor for you in your case?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是一個家教更像一個朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有 我有提議要付她錢 但她拒絕

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you did not pay her why did she have to reply the message at midnight the time that people should have already fallen asleep? Is this already beyond things that a co worker should do?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	那就是為什麼我說她是一個非常支持我的朋友他用他所有時間來幫助我學中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English at that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對我仍然在那工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does the co worker 王采燕still work there ?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也在那工作 不過我們不再是夥伴

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor , is there anything evidence that you want the court to investigate or anyone witness ?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like to subpoena王采燕who is working at the 伯元 cram school to be in court as a witness. And we would want her to explain the relationship she had between her and the plaintiff and we want her to explain the relationship or background information for the messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? 

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school had done some actions because of the relationship they have and the cram school even tried to persuade 王采燕to quit her job . I would like to verify this with the cram school.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, is there any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? The situation now is that the program is end on 12/5, 2012 . There is no reason that you could explain the relationship you and the co worker for helping the assignment. Especially, the interaction always start at 9:00 in the night. It is very doubtful.

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到法院能找到幫助我的證據 就像我說的我和同事間的簡訊非常平常 我只是想要提升我的中文能力且繼續學中文

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court day is set at 4:30 in the afternoon, 6/9, 2014 To do the inquiry for the witness. Both the plaintiff and the defendant should be in court on that day. Is necessary, both of you have a right to a lawyer, do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	 I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。

en-US	…You have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence that may help you with your case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我瞭解。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today this is the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. This case was filed by the plaintiff, Yu-hua Chen. The main reason for doing so is because the plaintiff’s husband is beyond a workers’ relationship.The plaintiff has discovered intimate messages in the defendants’ text mailbox. In addition, the defendant would make excuses … often make excuses to stay after work and frequently teleconference with his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang.…The information the plaintiff collected proves that the relationship is beyond a working relationship between colleagues.Therefore, she filed the case. The defendant, your wife accuses you of adultery. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然是無罪啦。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In our preparatory procedure today, our main goal is to inquire the details of the messaging between the defendant and your colleague. Our objective today is to make sure that the defendant really is committing adultery with a colleague. Are the two parties aware of the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff, how long have you been married to your husband. Do you have any children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years. We don’t have any children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Were you married in Taiwan or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. 4 years ago he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the recent years, he… has been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we just met, he was a Portuguese Teacher. After we were married, he continued to teach Portuguese. Portuguese is not a language popular among Taiwanese so his teaching hours were… unstable.Sometimes he would have empty…hours up to two months.Afterwards, to obtain a more stable income, he began to teach English. But English was not his mother tongue so he decided to seek advanced education.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	By advanced education, do you mean he sought a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Since he wished to teach English in Taiwan, the degree he sought must be related to English Education. He found a long distance online course from California of the United States… online. So he didn’t need to go to America in person to take the class. So when he obtains all his credits, he also gets his masters degree. His plan was to find an English teacher position in Taiwan through getting a degree from the United States. 

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What is the relationship he has with the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are collegues at the cram school. The cram school has a policy to partner up mandarin teachers and foreign teachers. That woman is the mandarin teacher partnered up with him.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they were in an affair

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first I only found that my husband often stayed long after work hours. I asked many times: It was only an English cram school, why would he need to stay so often after work? He told me that since he had to partner up with a Mandarin teacher, there had to be much effort put in to communicating with each other. At first I didn’t suspect anything at all. Later on, I found that after he would come home, he would receive phone calls. When he picks up the phone, he would never talk on the phone in person, but go to his study room instead. Because of this, I began to suspect him, so I inspected his phone record.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	…Did you find anything unusual in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his call records, there was… one number that frequently appeared. So I was… curious and began to inspect his text messages, too. And then I realized he was texting a woman almost everyday.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Is it really that serious?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it’s a normal, an usual text then there wouldn’t be any problem. But he is a married man, how could he let another person send intimate messages to him like that? Previously, I’ve sent some copies of their text messages of theirs to the court, they should be in the evidence right now.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Evidence number one, please. Page 13. There are a few message contents in here. May the defendant please take a look at them? Are these the text messages that are in your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對，這是我手機裡的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Then I have some questions to ask you about these messages. The first text message was sent from the phone number 0958-932XXX at 9:50 PM of November 21st 2012. The content is: “I really miss you, my love.” What does this mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	呃，這是我同事寄給我的。我記得我當時有兩天沒去上班。她有點擔心我。所以才傳這封簡訊給我。我的同事去美國留過學，所以非常開放，這是她講話的方式。至於她稱呼我為「my love」,這只是他對在乎的人表達的意思。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean the person who sent this message was educated in America, she’s more westernized. She’s more open with expressing her affections. So, by calling you my love there isn’t any meaning?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	不，這是好朋友之間很常有的用語，只是表達對彼此的在乎。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	What about the previous message before this… name?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我先前提到的，她只是為我擔心而已，我們是同事的關係。我有兩天沒去上班，她自而然地…為我擔心。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	What you mean is the only reason for her doing so is you took two days off from work? And because you were not there to help her in class, she missed you? Is that it?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊，那就是整件事情的脈絡。沒什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	All right. The second text message was also sent from the same cell phone number from 11:55pm of January 13th 2013. Inside the text message, it says, “I want to be by your side, when can we be truly together?” What does this mean? Why would a message like this appear in your cellphone?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳這個訊息給我是想要告訴我我作業裡的回答要怎麼講。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean she sent you this text message to help you with your homework? What do you mean by that?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我妻子在法庭中提到的，我當時在修一堂課。那堂課需要修滿30個學分我才能取得學位，所以我當然需要完成一些作業和練習。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you please elaborate on what you really are learning for your masters?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我修的是英語教育的課程。期中，有些課程是漢英語教學相關。有的是漢西方文化或語言能力有關。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So your seeking a TESOL masters degree, some courses are related to culture?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三堂課與文化和傳播有關係。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	Then, what kind of an assignment would you have to finish for the courses in culture and communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	每個學生會收到的作業可能都不同。舉我自己的例子來說吧，我人在台灣，然後想要找一份英語教學的工作。為了達成這個目標，然後展現我的能力，我必須表現出我對中文的瞭解。所以我的作業很多都是和中英翻譯有關係。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	What you mean is that because you are seeking a job to teach English in Taiwan, the homework requires you to have Chinese competence as well? So you have to finish certain assignments in your course, and they are often related to Chinese-English translation.

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，當然我還被要求要有口說還有寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	OK, let’s go back to what we mentioned before, you said this was your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我記得那句話。當我拿到中文句子時，我不知道英文剛怎麼說。你知道的，有很多中文的句子對外國人來說很難理解。我需要一些幫助，所以我同事來幫我。我請她幫我翻譯那個句子，再把答案寄給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So the situation was… you gave the Chinese sentence to your colleague and she sent back the English translation of it? So this text message was only an answer for an assignment?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那封簡訊就只是作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	OK, then, let’s take a look at Evidence number 1, page 14 to 16. Please take a look at the content. Are the reason behind sending all these text messages, your homework assignment?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，所有的簡訊都是要幫助我回答我作業的問題。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then may I ask you, may you explain that your wife is accusing you of having an affair with your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了。我知道她對我很不滿意，就在于沒辦法照顧好家庭上。法官我希望你知道，從我開始攻讀碩士到現在她一直沒有支持我。她一點也不想幫助我完成學業。她要是更支持我一點，我才不需要請我同事來幫我。我想這所有的誤解應該怪在她身上才對。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, there seems to be an unhappy relationship between the two parties.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們剛結婚的時候，我們的確度過了一些美好的時光。但是我的失業就是一個很大的問題。我嘗試要找到教葡萄牙文的工作，但沒辦法取得很穩定的工作時數，所有工作問題就成為我們兩個人之間的阻礙。我們時常為了這件事情吵架。她不認為我已經盡力了。我也真的沒辦法認清我的狀況與我面臨的問題。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Ok, then, let’s return to the Masters degree you mentioned. When did your courses begin? Did you finish all your courses? Did you obtain your degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始上課。它是一個兩年的課程。我本來能在2012年十二月完成學位的。但我最後沒有取得學位，因為當時有堅持的工作然後不夠時間去完成作業。就像我先前提到的，我老婆並不太支持我。我覺得我是孤單一個人地在爭取這個學位。我開始感到累，然後煩惱。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So you mean this…degree requires two years, two terms. But you didn’t finish your degree, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法去達到所有的課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	And when did your last term that you were registered in school end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一學期是2012年的秋天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If what you say is true, then your final term ends at September 12th 2012. And by then all your homework assignments have ended. But you continued to sent text message after the end of your course for over 6 months, how do you explain this?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我雖然沒有拿到學位、沒有完成這些課程，但這並不代表我不想繼續讓我英文進步啊！雖然我沒有完成我的課程，但我想不斷讓我的語言能力進步，所以我繼續努力。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So what you mean is that although you didn’t finish your masters courses, you wanted to improve your Mandarin on your own, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，這就是為什麼我找我同事幫我。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	Then the role your colleague takes is kind of like your tutor, is that right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不單只是我的家教，也是我真心的好朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我有主動提出要給她錢，但她拒絕我了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, then why did she reply your text messages late at night when she supposedly should be asleep? Doesn’t this exceed what colleagues do to help each other?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我才說她是一個很支持人的朋友。她犧牲她自己的時間來幫我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still teaching English at that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是，我還在那邊工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is your coworker Tsai-Yen Wang still working there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也正在那邊工作，但我們已經不是搭擋了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, are there any witnesses you wish to subpoena or evidences you wish to show?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I wish to subpoena the defendant’s coworker Tsai-Yen wang from the cram school. I would like her to explain the relationship she has between her and the defendant, and her reason for sending the text messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, are there any evidence that you wish for the court to investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard the cram school has taken some actions in response to the relationship between those two people. Somebody has tried to ask Tsai-Yen Wang to leave her position. I wonder if the cram school can… if there are any evidence to show this fact?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Now, the defendant, are there any evidence you wish for the court to help you investigate? The current situation is your degree courses have ended on December 5th 2012. Homework assignments is no excuse for the texting between you and Tsai-Yen Wang. Especially when your text messages are mainly sent after 9 PM at night. This arises suspicion. Do you have any evidence that may help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到任何證據可以請法院幫我調查的。就像我之前提到的，我和我同事往來的原因其實很簡單：我只想讓我的中文進步，然後不斷地練習中文而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next…witness… the next court for the case will be on June 9th 2014, 4:30PM. The plaintiff and the defendant are required to come to court in person. If it is necessary, you can all appoint lawyers, do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	OK, our court ends here.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

en-US	Do you fully understand you rights? 

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	了解

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today, we’re here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. Yu-Hua Chen filed this case. The main reason is that her husband, John Anderson sent intimate messages to his colleague working at the cram school. The person who filed this case checked the messages of her husband and found some intimate messages. Moreover, the defendant would make up some reasons, umm..for example, to have extra working hours in order to teleconference with his colleague, Tsai-Yen Wang. The intimate messages the plaintiff has found out were beyond coworker’s relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff decided to file this case. Defendant, you have violated the adultery, what is your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然無罪啊

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, our main goal is to ask for the details of the intimate messages sent between the defendant and his colleague, so that we can confirm whether the defendant and his colleague do constitute adultery. Do both parties understand our procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, plaintiff, how long have you been married to your husband? Do you two have any children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We’ve been married for four years, and we do not have any children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Were you married in Taiwan or in a foreign country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan in order to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	Then for the past few years, has his work always been teaching Portuguese? 

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, and after we got married, he was still teaching Portuguese. However, among Taiwanese, Portuguese is not a very prevalent and famous language. Therefore, his teaching hours are not too many. Sometimes, he even had a period between a month or two between jobs. Afterwards, in order to have a more stable income, he decided to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English; therefore, he decided to learn English and seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	What you mean by “seeking an advanced degree” is that he planned to pursue a higher degree in Taiwan? 

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	 No. He hopes to teach English in Taiwan; therefore, he needs to receive a degree which is related to English TESOL, and he found a distance learning program which is launched in California. Through this distance learning program, he’s able to learn online without flying to America. Therefore, after receiving the credits, he will be able to receive a master’s degree. His plan was that through getting this master’s degree, he will be able to teach English in Taiwan. 

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then I would like to ask what is the true relationship between his and the person who he had an affair with? 

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	Well, they are colleagues at the cram school. At the cram school, the woman was partnered with my husband, and the woman was a Chinese teacher, and my husband an English teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	Then how can you proof that they did have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	Well, at the beginning, I just noticed my husband often worked for longer hours at the cram school. And I asked him many times about how come? It was just a cram school! There’s no need, no way to have longer working hours. He told me that he needed to discuss about teaching matters and communicate with his Chinese partner. Therefore, at the beginning, I didn’t doubt him at all. But afterwards, I’ve found out that he will often receive calls after work. The strange this was, when he was answering these calls, he would just go back to his study room and answer the calls instead of answering them in front of me. Therefore, this made me very skeptical of him, and I checked his mobile phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Then did you find anything wrong or anything strange?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	Well, I’ve found out that one number appeared very, very often in his cell phone record. Therefore, I was so curious that I checked his instant messages. Then, I found out that he sent messages with a woman nearly every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	It’s just merely messages. How about the content? Are they unusual or intimate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If they were just normal messages, then I’m okay with that. However, he is married to me, how can he allow that woman to send him such intimate messages? I provided some content of the messages to the court earlier. I believe they’re in the folder. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Let’s look at evidence one, page thirteen. Defendant, please take a look at some of the messages here. Were these messages the same with the messages in your cell phone? 

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的。一模一樣。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	 Then I would ask you some questions according to these messages. The first message appears to be sent by someone, whose number was 0958932, at 9 pm, November 31, 2012, and the content was, I really miss you, my love.” What does this mean? 

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	喔，那是我同事發給我的啊。我記得我那時候請假，請了兩天。她那時很擔心我吧。那就是為甚麼她會發那一封訊息給我。而且她是在美國長大、受教育的，所以她是一個非常開放的女生。那就是她講話的方式和表達的方式啊。至於「我的愛」，只是互相叫對方會用的辭啊，並沒有代表甚麼意思。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Okay, so do you mean that the person who sent this message to you was westernized because she was educated in the US? Therefore, she was very open with her feelings, and the word “my love” doesn’t mean anything, is that right? 

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	對啊，當然沒有意思啊， 因為那只是親密的朋友或好朋友之間的稱呼而以。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	Then how about the previous sentence that she sent? 

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	我剛剛已經提到了，她那時候非常擔心我，而且我們是工作夥伴! 我兩天沒去工做啊，她當然會想我啊!

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Okay, what you mean is, because you haven’t been to work for two days; therefore you colleague missed you and was worried about you? Moreover, without your assistance, she missed you? Was that merely the reason? 

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊，內容就是這樣子，所以我的那一封訊息根本不算甚麼啊!

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Okay, let’s look at the second message, sent by the same person at 11:55 pm, January 13, 2013. The content was, “I want you by my side, when will we be together?” So what did this sentence mean? Why did this person want to send you this sort of content?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	因為她要教我如何用中文表達這一種內容。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Oh, so you mean she sent you this message in order to teach you, assist you, explain to you how to translate sentences? What does this mean? 

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太跟庭上說的，我正在攻讀碩士學位。要順利拿到學位，我必須拿到30學分。當然是要做一些作業、一些練習啊。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Please explain clearly to me, what were you studying for concerning your master’s program? 

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	就是英語教學的碩士學位啊。在學位裡面，還有分英語教學的課程、文化的課程、和交流的課程。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that this master’s degree was mainly about English teaching; however, you are also studying about culture interaction, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對，至少有三門課是跟文化交流、溝通相關的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what sort of assignment will be assigned in these courses? 

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	每個人所被分配到的作業不一樣。因為我现在在台灣，希望找到一份英語教學的工作。因此，為了達成這個目標，我必須能證明我有足夠的中文能力。因此我有很多作業都是有關中英字句的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So you mean that because you planned to teach English in Taiwan; therefore, this master’s degree will be able to proof that you have enough Chinese language competence? Therefore, you have the finish the assignments being assigned in these courses, and the assignments include Chinese and English sentence translation? 

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對沒錯，而且我有必須加強我口說和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay, then let’s start again. You said that this was your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我記得。當我拿到那一份作業的時候，我不知道它是甚麼意思。而且你知道，對有些外國人來說，有些中文字句非常難懂。因此，我非常需要幫助，所以我就問了我的同事啊。我請她幫我翻那一句話，然後透過簡訊傳給我答案。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Okay, so what you mean was that at that time, you first sent the Chinese version of that sentence, and she helped you translate it and sent you that sentence in English? Is that right? And that means this message was just the answer to your assignment? 

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	沒錯，只是作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	 Okay, then let’s take a look at evidence one, page 14 to 16, and let’s take a look at all the content of all the messages. Please, just take a look at these contents. And the main reason was, because you want to finish your assignment, and you asked your colleague to translate them for you? 

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯，所有的訊息都是因為我要完成我的作業，拿到答案，所以才會有這些訊息。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then how about your wife filing the adultery case against you and your colleague Ms. Tsai-Yen Wang? 

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太對於這事真的想太多了。我知道她對於我提供家庭一些資金啊不是很滿意。在此，我想告訴庭上，我在攻讀碩士學位期間，我太太從來沒有關心我。而且她也沒有協助我完成我的碩士學位。如果她願意支持我、幫助我的話，那我也不會請我的同事幫我啊。所以我覺得她才是要被責怪的對象。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your saying, it seems that between you and your wife, the relationship is not very good. 

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	結婚後的一段時間，我們相處確實很好啦。但是最大的問題在於我有沒有工作。我在台灣試著教葡萄牙語，但是我的時數很少。因此這個問題就成了我們兩人之間的一到牆。我們為這件事就一直吵架，吵了好多次。她不認為我已經盡力了。她也不了解我面臨這種窘境的時候，感到多受挫、多憤怒。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, then let’s go back to the master’s degree that we’ve just mentioned. When did you start that master’s program? Did you receive a master’s degree? Has it ended?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在春季2011年入學的。我需要攻讀兩年。我應該是要在103年的12月就要完成這個學位。但是因為那時我兼職，導致我無法準時完成我的學位，因為沒時間寫作業。如同我剛剛所提的，我太太一點都沒支持我。結果我那時就覺得非常的無助啊，好像是我自己孤拎拎的要拿到那個學位。因此我感到非常的勞累、受挫。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	Okay, so you said that this master’s degree requires a two-year study; however, you didn’t received that degree on time, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	因為我無法如期完成課程所需的作業。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	Then when was the last date you registered for the program? 

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	是在103年的秋季班註冊。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	According to your statement, the semester that you finished the course would be December 5, 2012, and after your complete that semester, you won’t have any assignment, right? However, the colleague kept sending your messages six months after your study, why was that

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我那時候是還沒有拿到碩士學位，但是那又並不代表我不想增進我的語言能力。縱使我沒有拿到那個學位，我依然想要我的中文能力進步啊，自己字學啊。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that even if you didn’t successfully get that master’s degree, you still hope to improve you Chinese ability, is that so?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對啊，而且那就是為什麼我會尋求我的同事幫助。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the role that your colleague was playing equals to your mentor? 

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，還是我真正的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Then, did you pay her? 

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有喔，沒有付錢給她。我有提過要付給她，但是她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t even pay her, then why would she be willing to send you messages in the middle of the night, when she could just sleep? Don’t you think that this was just beyond coworker’s relationship? 

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	我才會說她是一個非常好的朋友啊。她願意占用她自己的時間，幫助我。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still teaching at that same cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是的，我還是在那裏工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So, is your colleague Tsai-Yen Wang still working at that cram school, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	對，她還在那裏工作，但我們已經不是搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Does the prosecutor need to subpoena or have other witnesses? 

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena the defendant’s coworker Tsai-Yen Wang who works at Po-Yuan cram school, and come here as witness. I would ask her to clearly state the background and goal of the messages she sent to the defendant.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plaintiff, do you wish the court to investigate on any evidence? 

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I’ve heard that the cram school has already taken some action against the relationship between them. About their action, they have persuaded Tsai-Yen Wang to quit her job. I would like to ask whether it is possible to verify this issue. 

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Now, currently, the situation is that you finished your master’s degree on December 5, 2012, Therefore, making an excuse of doing an assignment with Tsai-Yen Wang is not really reasonable. Especially, the interaction between you two often appears after 9 pm. That makes one very, very skeptical. Do you have any evidence which may help you with your case? Now, let me ask the defendant, what would you like the court to investigate on the case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	沒有，我並沒有證據要庭上代表我去偵查。之前已經提過了，我和同事之間的交流、互動是非常簡單的。只是想要增進我的語文能力，繼續學中文啊。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The court will set the time to ask the witness to come to the court at 4:30 pm, June 9, 2012. The plaintiff and the defendant need to come to the court. And if it’s necessary, each party can ask for a lawyer.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	The court is adjourned.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是，我了解。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The plaintiff, Yu-Hua, Chen, filed this case. The reason for the plaintiff to file this case is that her husband, John Anderston, is beyond co-workers’ relationship with a person. The plaintiff found some intimate messages and records in the defendant’s cell phone. Furthermore, the defendant, John Anderston, found reasons for working late in the cram school and conducted tele-conferencing with Chai-yan Wang. The contents collected by the plaintiff were beyond co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, your wife is wondering whether you have an affair with others, so she accused you.

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然無罪。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the court will focus on the details of these tele-conferencings and intimate messages. The purpose of this procedure is to see whether the interactions between John Anderston and Chai-yan Wang constitute the adultery. Did both parties understand this procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我也明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plaintiff. How long have you got married with the defendant? Did you have a child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years, and we don’t have any child.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or other countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the past years, his job in Taiwan is to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we knew each other initially, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he still taught Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a very popular language in Taiwan; his teaching hours were not stable. Sometimes, there had been a period between works for months. In order to have stable incomes, he decided to teach English instead. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek a advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he wanted to seek a advanced degree. Did he want to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. He wanted to teach English in Taiwan. The degree he wanted to get is about English teaching. He found a distance learning program in California in the United Stated on the Internet. This program allowed him to learn by on-learning, so he didn’t have to go abroad. After he finished all the courses of the program, he could get the degree. He planed to get the degree so that he can teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So, what is the relationship between the person he have an affair with, Chai-yan Wang?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in the cram school. The cram school staff arranged one Chinese teacher partnering with a foreign teacher. Chai-yan Wang is the Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have some extramarital affairs?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	Initially, I noticed that he often stayed late in the cram school for working. I had asked him before because it was just a cram school to teach English. How can he work so late? He told me that because his partnered with a Chinese teacher, they had to discuss more in detail. In the beginning, I did not suspect of him. Later, he often got some phone calls after he came home. After getting the calls, he all went to the study room to talk and did not talk before me. This behavior made me suspect, so I checked his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Is there any doubtful clue in his cell phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his calling record, there is one number showing up very often. So, I checked his text messages with that number. After I checked text messages, I found that he sends messages with a woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Sending text messages is not a big deal. Is that very inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If this is a normal text message, that’s all. But he has got married with me, how can he send intimate messages with another woman? I have provided some details about these messages to the court, and these details may be included in the investigatory files.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please check page 13 on the investigatory file 1. These are the contents taken from those messages. Please check it. Were these contents from your messages?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是，這是從我的手機簡訊中取下來的。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now, the court will ask you some questions in terms of this content. The first is the message sent at 9:50 on November 31st, 2012, and the number is 0958-932XXX. The content is “我非常想念你.” What does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我一個同事發給我的。我記得那時候我請兩天假。她非常擔心。這才是為什麼她傳簡訊給我。我同事是在美國受教育的，她的思想十分開放。這就是她說話的方式。至於裡面說的愛，只是我們關懷他人的說法而已。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You said that the woman was educated in the United States, so her concept is more westernized. The expression about her emotion is more open-minded. So, the word “my love” does not have some other implications, does it?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	這只是好朋友間會講的，沒有什麼特別的意思。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the last sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	如前所說，她非常擔心我，我們是工作同事。我兩天沒到，她當然會掛念我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that the person sent this message to you because you had two day off at that time? Without your assistance in class, she was very missing you. Is that all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對，沒錯，這簡訊不是什麼大問題啊。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent at 11:55 p.m. on January 13th, 2013. The message is that “我想要妳陪我，我們什麼時候能在一起呢.” What does this sentence mean? Why is there such a message

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她寫這個句子的原因是，要怎麼把這個句子寫成中文，這是我們作業的內容。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Did you mean that she sent you this message because she wanted to help you complete you assignment? What dose that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太跟庭上所說，我有英語教學的課程。在那個課堂中，我必須要取得30學分，才能擁有學位。當中我會有些作業和活動。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you explain the degree you were perusing?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程是英語教學。在那課程中，有英語教學課程，也有文化背景的相關教學。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you are pursuing the degree from the graduate school of TESOL, and in this program, there are some classes related to culture competence. Is that true?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	沒錯，我記的有3個是有關文化溝通的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	In this class, what were the assignments given within it?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	在文化溝通這堂課中，每個學生的作業都不同。拿我自身舉例。我想在台灣找個英語教學的職位。為了這個目標，我必須要有能力來證明我的中文能夠變通。所以在作業上，有許多中英翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So, you mean that you wanted to teach in Taiwan. Therefore, in the courses of the program, you have to proof your Chinese competence. So, you have to finish the assignments arranged by the program so that you can prove your language competence. Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	沒錯，我也想增進我的聽力還有寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So, let us go back to the sentence. This sentence is your assignment. Is it true?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對，我記得這個句子。當我拿到一個英文句子時，我不知怎麼用中文講它。有些句子外國人很難說。我需要些幫忙，所以就找我同事。我問他怎麼翻譯這個句子，她就用簡訊回我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you asked the collogue to translate the sentence into Chinese and that she sent back with the English sentence. Is that true? That is to say, the sentence in the text message is that answer of your assignment. Is that right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	這個句子只是我作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now, please check page 14-16 on the investigatory file 1.Please check the content. Because you asked for help to complete your assignment, she sent these messages. Is that right?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯，這些簡訊都是為了要完成作業而傳的。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What’s your explanation in terms of your wife’s doubt you have an affair with Chai-yan, Wang?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我老婆想太多了。我知道他對我有固定收入這件事非常不滿意。告訴庭上，我的老婆在課程上並沒給予我任何協助。她根本沒有意願要幫我完成這個學位。如果她多幫我一點，我就不會像我同事求救啊。我覺得她應該為件事被譴責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you just said, you two are not very happy with each other.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在婚姻剛開始，我們真的過得很快樂。問題就在我的就業狀況。我想在台灣教葡萄牙語，但授課時數都不是很穩定。我的工作情況變成我們相處的問題。因

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to the program. When did you start participating in the program? Is that finished? Did you get your degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年剛開始時參與的。這是2年的課程。我應該在2012年12月完成的。但我沒辦法在這2年內完成學位，因為現在工作太忙了，沒辦法完成所有的作業。就像我剛說的，我的老婆根本不支持我。我覺得只能靠自己的力量來完成這個學位。我非常勞累、感到挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You just said that this program is a two-year program, and you had not finished it yet. What’s the reason?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法達成這些課程所有的需求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When was the last registration date? When did it end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一次註冊的時間是2012年的秋天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	According to what you just said, the program ended on December 5th, 2012. There is some duration between the dates you just said. So, at that time, you don’t have any assignments, right? However, after the program ended, you still got messages from the person for 6 months. Why?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	雖然我沒有完成那個課程，但就不代表我不想增進我的語言能力啊。雖然我沒有完成這個課程，但我還是想要增進我的中文能力，所以我就自學。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that although you fell to finish the program, you still want to enhance your Chinese language competence and want to speak fluent Chinese. Is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對，所以我就請我同事幫忙我。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So, this co-worker served as the Chinese tutor for you. Is that right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教，而是我真正的好朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，雖然我有要付她錢，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	Without your payment, why did still send you messages in the very late time when most people go to bed? Are these interaction beyond co-workers’ relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說這個朋友非常支持我。她用她自己的時間幫我學中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Did you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對，我還在那邊工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does this person still work there as well?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那家補習班上課，但我們現在沒有跟她搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, is there any need to subpoena another person in this case?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena the defendant’s colleague, Chai-yan, Wang, who is working in the Bo-Yuan cram school as the witness in this case. I would like to ask her to explain her relationship with the defendant and to elaborate the purposes of these text messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The plaintiff, is there any evidence which you hope the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that that cram school has taken some actions about the relationship between my husband and that party. One of the actions is that the cram school asked Chai-yan, Wang to quit her job. I want the cram school to proof and make more explanations for that.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, is there any evidence that you hope the court to investigate for you? Now, the situation is that your program had ended on December 5th, 2012. There is no reason to explain why you two send messages to each other after you fell the program, especially the time when you sent text messages and interacted with each other, because the time is too late. Do you have any evidence to explain for yourself?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我手邊沒有任何證據和資料來佐證。就像我說，我們兩個傳簡訊、互動的理由很簡單。我只是想增進我的語文能力，和繼續學中文而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	Then, the court will set the next court date at 4:30 p.m. on July 9th, 2014 for the inquiry procedure. The defendant, you have to attend the court. It is necessary that both of you can have a lawyer at that day. Do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Okay, the today’s court will end here.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	 Today we are here for preparatory procedure of adultery case.The defendant named Yu-Hua Chen filed this case.The main reason is that her husband has an intimate relationship with his co-worker in the cram school.The plantiff found some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. In addition, her husband often has tele-conferencing with his co-worker, Cai-Ian Wang in the midnight, and he often stay up late…..The evidence that the plantiff found has beyond co-worker’s relationship. That is the reason why the plantiff filed this case.Defendant, what’s your plea about your wife charged you of adultery. 

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我無罪

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the main point is to question the defendant of the message with his co-worker.The purpose is to investigate whether these messages can constitute the adultery.Both parties, do you fully understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	 I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	Plantiff, how long have you married with your husband? Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	I have married with my husband for 4 years. We don’t have children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you marry with your husband in Taiwan? Or other countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	 We met each other in Taiwan, He taught Portuguese in Taiwan 4 years ago.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So he has taught Portuguese in Taiwan in the past years?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he still taught Portuguese.However, Portuguese is not so popular in Taiwan. Therefore, his teaching hours is not stable.Sometimes, he did not work for 1 or 2 months. Therefore, in order to have more income, he started to teach English.However, since his mother tongue is not English, he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You have mentioned he is going to seek an advanced degree, does it mean that he has to study for a degree in Taiwan….

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	NO.Because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, he has to get a degree for English teaching.He has found a distance learning program provided from California,Therefore, he can have a distance learning in Taiwan, rather than going to America.After he finished this distance program, he can get a degree.The reason he takes this distance learning program is that he can get a job of English teacher.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What is his relationship with the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in cram school.In that cram school, they are partners. One is Chinese teacher, and the other is English teacher. She is the Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know that they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	First, I only realized that my husband often work late in cram school.I have asked him the question that how come you have so many work to do in a English cram school?He told me that he has to partner with a Chinese teacher. They have many things to discuss with.At first, I really didn’t suspect him.However, I have found he usually picked up some phone calls after he got home.When he answered the phone, he would go to the study room instead of talking in front of me.That the reason why I started to suspect him and I checked his cellphone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Do you find any problem in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I often see the same phone number in his phone book.Therefore, I was so curious about it so I checked his text message.Then I found that he texts with a woman almost every day. 

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	It is just a message. Is something improper in the message?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	 If it is just a normal message, it’s okay.However, he is a married person. How can he let other text him with some intimate messages?I have provided some intimate messages for the court. It should be in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	As the file one, page.13.Defendant, please see the content of these messages. Are these messages taken from your cellphone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的,這是我手機上的訊息

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I am going to ask you some questions about these messages.The message is from the phone number 0958-932***. The date is 9:50 p.m., Nov.31st, 2012.The content is “我真的很想你,親愛的” what is this about?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這是我一個同事傳給我的我記得那時候,我休了兩天假他有點擔心我所以他才會傳這封信我的同事是在美國接受教育的,因此思想很開放這是他表達情感的方式至於”親愛的”,這是對我們所關心的人的一個統稱

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that the person who sent you this message has spent some time in western countries. Therefore, she is more open-minded.She is also open-minded in expressing her emotions?Therefore, the words ”my love” do not have much meaning, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	對阿 就只是好朋友間的稱呼

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the last sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我剛說的,我們是同事,他就只是擔心我當我不在兩天,他自然會想我啊

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean that it because that you took two days off, she sent you this message. Without your assistance, she misses you. Is that all?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對阿 就這樣啊 這訊息又沒什麼

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message is sent at 11:55 p.m. Jan.13th, 2013, and is from the same phone number.The content is that”我希望你在我身邊,什麼時候能成真呢?”Then what does this mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他寫這封信只是想告訴我怎麼寫作業

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean that she sent you this message to help you do your homework? How?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太說的,我有參加遠距教學課程我需要修習30學分,才能得到學位所以我當然需要完成一些作業

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Please explain that what did you learn from this program?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程是關於英語教學 課程內容有分幾個部分, 有英語教學,文化及語言能力等等

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you get a degree in TESOL, but there are some courses about culture communication, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對阿 我記得至少有三堂課是關於文化溝通

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What is the assignment from the culture and communication course?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	針對每個不同的學生,會有不同的作業就我而言我在台灣,並且想得到一份英語教學的工作為了達到這個目標,我必須證明我有足夠的中文能力因此,我有很多關於英中句子翻譯的作業

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Because you want to teach English in Taiwan, you have to prove that you have certain language competence in Chinese, right?So you have to finish some assignments in this course, and they are English-to-Chinese translation of sentences? Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是阿 就是這樣啊 我另外也需要加強我的口說和寫作技巧

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s go back to the last sentence. You said that it’s your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對阿 我還記得這句子當我拿到這個中文句子時,我不知道怎麼翻譯你也知道吧, 有些中文字對外國人來說很難記得我需要一些幫助阿 所以我找我同事我請他幫我翻譯,然後再傳給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Your co-worker translated this sentence into English and sent to you, right?That is to say, the content of this message is just the answer of my homework.

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	是的 就只是我作業的解答

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now please see the file one, page.14-16.Please see these contents.  Are these messages all about your assignment?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對的 所有簡訊都是關於作業上的問題

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	What is your explanation about your wife charged you of having an affair with Cai-Ian Wang?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了我知道他對我對於這個家的付出感到不滿我希望庭上知道,打從一開始,他就不支持我修這課程他不願意幫助我完成這份課程如果他願意幫我的話,我就不用問我同事拉 因此 我認為他要為這些誤會負責 

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you said, there seems to be some disagreements between you and your wife? 

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在剛結婚的時候,我們的確相處得不錯  但問題就出在我的工作我試著在台灣教葡萄牙文,但卻沒有穩定的工作時數因此我的工作成了我們之間的大問題我們常為了這件事爭吵他不相信我真的已經盡力了我不知道要怎樣讓他了解我的困難和挫折

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s talk about the aforementioned courses.When did it start? Did you get your degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	 我的課程是在2010年春天開始 這是兩年的課程我應該是要在2012年12月完成我並沒有完成這課程,因為我在做兼職的工作,沒有足夠的時間完成作業就像我說的,我太太並不支持我做這件事我覺得我只有一個人在努力得到這學位我覺得很累而且很挫折

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	This is a two-year program. Why did you fail to finish it?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法達到所有課程的要求

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When did your last semester end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	最後一學期是2012年秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	According to what you said, after Dec.5, 2012. You have no more assignments after then, right?Then how come you still contact with your co-worker…….

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我雖然沒辦法完成課程,但這並不代表我不想增進我的語言能力 即使我拿不到學位,我還是很努力地想靠自己增進我的中文能力

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So even if you failed the program, you still want to improve your Chinese ability, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對 這就是為什麼我尋求同事的幫助

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So this co-worker just plays a role like your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不只是我的家教,更是我的好朋友 

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Do you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	我想付他錢,但她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	Why she answered you in the midnight even if you didn’t pay her?Is this behavior beyond co-worker’s relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	所以我才說他是個很支持我的朋友阿他不惜犧牲自己的時間幫助我學中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still wok in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對阿 我還在那教英文

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is Cai-Ian Wang still working there, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	他還在那工作啊,只是我們不是搭檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you want to subpoena any witness or to investigate any other evidence?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	 I hope to subpoena Cai-Ian Wang who works in Bo-Yuan cram school as a witness. I want her to explain the relationship between her and the defendant. Also, the details of the messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Plantiff, do you have any other evidence that you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has taken some actions about their relationship.Among that, I heard that the cram school has persuaded Cai-Ian Wang to quit the job. I wonder whether I can ask the cram school for this.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you?The situation is that your program has finished on Dec.5th, 2012.You have no reason to text message with Cai-Ian Wang Especially that you two also text message to each other after 9:00 p.m.Do you have any evidence to help you with this case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我想不到任何可以請庭上為我調查的證據就像我說的,我們之間傳簡訊的原因是很單純的我真的只是想要增強我的語言能力並學中文

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court for questioning of witness is set at 4:30 p.m. June 9th, 2014.Plantiff and Defendant, you have to show up. If necessary, both parties have right to a lawyer.

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Okay, today’s procedure is over. 

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？

The plaintiff has found some intimate messages in his cell phone. In addition, the plaintiff’s husband will find reasons for working late or tele-conferences with his co-worker Cai Yan Wang. The messages that the plaintiff has collected has been beyond the co-workers’ relationship. As a result, she files this case. The defendant, your wife suspects you of adultery, what’s your pleat?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我無罪答辯

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？

en-US	We have been married for four years and we do not have children. 

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Are you married in Taiwan or broad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I meet with my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	In the past years, did he also teach Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher. After we got married, he continued to teach Portuguese. However, because the Portuguese is not so common language that people learn in Taiwan, so his teaching hours are not so fixed. Sometimes the period between jobs will be two months. Then he hoped he can get the fixed income, so he started to teach English. However, because his mother language is not English, he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You mentioned that he wanted to seek an advanced degree, is he want to get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Because he hoped to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he achieved has to be English teaching. He found a distant learning program which is provided by the California in America on the Internet. He can complete his courses with the distant learning without going to the America. In this way, he can achieve the doctor degree. He planned to achieve American degree to find the English teaching job in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what is his relationship between the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are co-workers in the cram school. In that cram school, they have arranged the teachers to partner with each other. And the person is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know they have adultery?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	In the beginning, I just found that my husband will always work late in school. I asked it is just an cram school, why do you work so late? He told that he had to partner with the Chinese teacher, and there are so many things to discuss. In the beginning, I didn’t doubt him. However, I found that he will get some phone calls after work. After he got the phone call, he will not talk in front of me; instead, he will go to the study room. I started to doubt him, so I checked his cell phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So what did you see in his cell phone that is innormal

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In his phone call history, there is a fixed number. So I was curious that I checked his messages. After checking, he has sent a message to a woman almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Is there any wrong to send message? Is it because the message is not so appropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If the message is so ordinary, then it will be fine. But he was a person who got married, how can he send the intimate messages? I provided the message contents to the court. I think they are all in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please check the page 13 on the file 1. The defendant, there are some message contents, please check this. Are these messages the contents in your cell phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	沒錯

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Now I want to ask you some questions according to these contents. The first message is sent in the number of 0958932… at 9:50 pm November 31st 2012. The content is “I really miss you, my love” What’s the meaning?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	嗯…那是我同是寄的啊！我記得那時候我請了2天的假。她感到有點擔心。這就是為甚麼她寄給我這種簡訊。我同事在美國讀過書，所以她非常的開放。那就是她說話的方式啊！為甚麼她說”love”這個字呢? 這就是我們稱呼彼此的方法啊！

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that the message sender because he once studied in America so she is open minded? And she is also open minded in emotion expression, so the word “my love” do not have any special meaning?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	沒有啊，在朋友之間這是非常平常的表達方法

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the sentence she mentioned?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	就像我說的啊，她非常擔心我，我們是工作上的夥伴啊！當我請了2天假，她非常想念我啊！

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean because you took two days off so the woman sends this message to you? Without your assistance, so she missed you? Is that…?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊，這就是內容啊！那簡訊根本就沒什麼

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	OK, and the second message is sent in the same number at 11:55 pm January 13th 2013. The content is “I want you by my side, when can we be together?” So what does this message mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	null

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You mean the woman sent you the message just to help you with your assignment? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太跟庭上說的啊，我正在上碩士的課。在這個課程，我必須修滿30學分我才能得到學位。而我也需要完成一些作業和練習。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain that what is your major in your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的主要課程是英語教學。在那個課程中，有些是有關英語教學的，有些則是有關文化和語言能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So what you learn is English teaching, but there are some cultural courses in this program?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得至少三門課是跟文化和溝通有關。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what’s the assignment that this course will require?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這文化溝通課程的作業會依每個學生而不一樣。以我自己為例，我來台灣是為了想要找到教學的工作，為了達成這個目標並表達我有足夠的能力，我必須擁有足夠的中文。所以很多作業都是有關中英翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean you want to teach Chinese in Taiwan, so in this program of master degree you have to prove your have competence of Chinese. And you have to finish assignment in this course, and some of the assignment is about English and Chinese translation?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	沒錯，而且我還被要求要訓練我的口說和寫作能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s move back to the message we mentioned before. Is that your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是啊，我記得那個句子。當我拿到這個中文句子，我不知道要怎麼翻譯。你也知道有些中文字對外國人來說非常難。我需要一些幫助，所以我就請我的同事幫忙。我請她幫我翻譯這個句子然後再傳簡訊給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean you sent the Chinese sentence to your co-worker and she translated it into English and sent back to you, is that right? So the message is the answer to your assignment?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，這封簡訊只是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Now let’s take a look at page 14-16 on file 1. Please take a look at it. Are all those messages sent by your co-worker just because you want to do your homework?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是啊，這些簡訊全都是為了要完成我的作業才傳的

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	And what’s your explanation about that your wife suspected you have adultery with your co-worker Cai Yan Wang?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得我太太想太多了。我知道她對我無法扶養這個家庭感到不滿意。我希望法庭知道我開始上課時我太太都不支持我。她不願意幫助我得到這個學位。如果她能多一點支持我的話，我就不會請我同事幫忙了。我覺得她該為這個誤會負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to what you said, it seems that you do not interact with your wife so happily?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	剛結婚時我們關係還算好。但問題就是我的工作問題。我想要在台灣教葡萄牙語，但是工作時數一直不穩定。所以工作問題就變成我們2個之間關係的問題了。我們常常為了這個問題吵架，她不相信我已經盡力了，我也無法讓她了解我是多麼的無力還有我面臨的…

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	OK, let’s move back to the master program you mentioned. When did your master degree program started? Did you finish it? Did you get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	這個碩士課程從2010年春季開始。它是2年的課程。這個課程應該在12月22日就完成了。我沒有完成這個課程因為我有兼一些工作，所以沒時間做功課。就像我說的，我太太都不支持我，我覺得我都是孤軍奮鬥在完成那個課程的。我覺得非常疲累也非常無力。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean the program is two-year but you didn’t finish it, why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成所有課程的要求

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	When your registered semester end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我最後一個註冊學期是2012年…

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So according to what you said, that your program will end on December 5th 2012, then after that you won’t have any assignment. However, after your program ended, the message between you and your co-worker is still keep going, then why?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我沒完成那個學位並不代表我不想再增進我的語言能力。雖然課程結束了，但是我還是想要學中文

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that although you failed your master degree program, you still want to improve your Chinese competence, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	沒錯，這就是為甚麼我要請我的同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the role your co-worker plays is a little like your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是家教，她也是我真正的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Do you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	我有說要付錢給她，但她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why she bothered to send you the message to help you to learn Chinese in the mid-night? Is this behavior just beyond the co-worker’s behavior?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，她是非常支持我的朋友，她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach English in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是的，我還在那邊工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	So the co-worker Cai Yan Wang is also working there now?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她還在那邊工作啊，但我們不再是一起教書的夥伴了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Prosecutor, do you have any evidence or witness that you want to subpoena? 

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena the defendant’s co-worker, which is Cai Wan Wang, working in the Bo Yuan cram school. I hope her to explain the relationship between the defendant and her and the purpose of those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The plaintiff, do you have any evidence that you want to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has take some action about the relationship between my husband and his co-worker. And they tried to persuade to quit the job. I hope that the court can confirm this from the cram school.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence you hope the court to investigate? Now the situation is that your master program has finished on December 5th 2012. There is no reason you send the message between you and your co-worker just to finish your assignment. Especially that the messages between your co-worker and you are after 9 pm, it’s a little suspectful. Do you have any evidence that will help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我目前想不到任何證據可以請法院幫我調查的。就像我說的，我跟我同事對話目的都沒什麼。我只是想要增進我的語言能力和學中文

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	So the cross-questioning procedure will be set at 4:30 pm June 9th 2014. The plaintiff and the defendant, you have to attend the court on that day. If necessary, you can have your lawyer, do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	So the court dismiss here today.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序
en-US	null

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國103年5月27日。」

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我知道了

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we’re here to day for the adultery case. The plaintiff Yu-Hua Chen filed the case. Because her husband John Anderson has developed intimate encounter with his colleague in cram school. The plaintiff has discovered some intimate message in her husband’s cell phone. Also, the plaintiff’s husband constantly make up reasons for extending his shift and have tele-conferencing with his co-worker 王彩燕. The evidence gathered by the plaintiff has shown that her husband and 王彩華has go beyond co-worker’s relationship, therefore consisted this lawsuit. Defendant, you wife suspects that you’re having an affair, what do you say about that?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	我當然無罪啊

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, we’re going to look into the details of the communication record of the defendant and his co-worker. The purpose of this is to know whether if they’re having an affair and if it really constitutes an adultery case. Do both parties understand the procedure.

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是  我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, I want to ask the plaintiff, how long have you and your husband been married? 

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years and we have no children. 

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you get married in Taiwan or outside Taiwan?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met in Taiwan. Four years ago when he first came to Taiwan, he came to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in the pass few years, has he been teaching Portuguese in Taiwan?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	He was a Portuguese Teacher when we first met. And after we got married, he still teaches Portuguese. But Portuguese is not that much a popular language, so his working hours are unstable. Sometimes there are even periods between jobs in months. In this sense, he wanted to have a more stable job, so he started teaching English. As English is not his mother tongue, he decided to seek an advance degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You said about seeking a more advance degree. Do you mean he intended to study in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	He wants to teach in Taiwan, so the degree he’s seeking must be related to TESOL. He found a distance learning program of the University of California on the internet. So he doesn’t have to be in the States to get the degree, instead he could get the degree by distant learning. So he can manage to get the degree after he finished all the credits. His plan is that to get the degree licensed by the United states, he could get an English teaching job here in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So what exactly is the relationship between your husband and his mistress in this case?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They’re partners and co-workers in cram school. So in the cram school, they have a policy to partner the foreign teacher with the local teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	Then you do you know they’re having an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, the only thing I found was that my husband was lengthening his shift. I asked him isn’t it just a cram school, what’s there to be lengthening your working hours? What he told me was that, since he has to partner with the local teacher therefore he needs more time to practice. I did not doubt him at first. Then after a while, he had been picking up phone calls after his work shifts. And after he picked up the phone, he wouldn’t talk in frond of me, instead he talked in the study room. This made me very suspicious, so I checked his phonebook. 

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you find anything unusual in his phonebook?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I found a constantly dialed number. Being very curious, I also checked his text message. And this was when I discovered that he was contacting this mistress.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Well, after all it’s just text message, is there anything that’s inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it was just very simple text message, I wouldn’t go for it. But he’s a married man, how could he let a woman send him some intimate messages? I have provided some evidence for the court, I think they are in the case files.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please see the evidence file 1. Here are several text message content, defendant please take a look. Are these text messages sent from your phone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	對 這確實是我手機裡的手機內容

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	I’m going to ask you a few questions based on these text messages. The first text message was sent at nine fifty PM on the 31st of November 2013 from the cellphone 0958-932***. The content was內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這只是我同事傳給我的啦, 我記得那時候我剛好修了兩天假, 他大概有點擔心吧所以他才傳這封簡訊, 我的同事是在美國接受教育地所以他的思想非常開放, 那就是他表達的方式啊, 至於說 噢 我的愛  那只是對關心的人表達的一種方式

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean your colleague is more westernized because she studied in the United States. And she’s more open minded in terms of emotions.So the content my love doesn’t have any special meaning right? 

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	當然不是啊, 這在好朋友和老朋友之間是很正常的表達方式

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about her previous sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	如我所說, 她只是擔心我而已, 我們就是工作的同事/夥伴, 當我請了兩天假, 她很自然而然的想念我

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	You mean she sent you this text message just because you didn’t come to work for two days? Without your assistance she missed you? Is that it? 

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	對啊  最主要就是這樣, 這封簡訊的內容就單純只是這樣而已

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	So the second text message was sent at 23:55, 13th of January 2013 from the same cellphone 0958, is that right? 內容是我真的好想你, 希望你真的能陪在我身邊, What do you mean by that? Can you elaborate?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她這麼發訊息只是告訴我我的中文作業理該怎麼表達

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	You’re saying that she sent you this message so as to help you huh?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	當我太太像法院提出告訴, 我正在休息我的碩士學位, 要取得那個學位我必須先完成30個學分, 我自然而然需要完成一些作業和課業

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain what exactly are you studying in your master profra

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的學位是英語教學碩士學位, 這學位的內容有部分是英語教學, 那其他部分還包含文化課程和語言能力

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you’re getting a degree in TESOL, and there are cross cultural communication courses in this program right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	對 我記得至少有三門課是跟文化還有溝通有關

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what kind of assignments do they give you in the cultural communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	文化溝通的作業會因學生而異, 就我自己來舉例, 我在台灣試圖尋求英語教學的工作機會, 為了達到這個目標, 我必須證明我有中文能力, 所以我的一些作業內容就會包含中英翻譯

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	You mean because you’re planning to teach in Taiwan so you have to show that you have some Chinese competence right? As a result you have to complete some Chinese courses, and in these courses, there are Chinese-english translation right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	當然, 我也被要求要加強我的口說和寫作能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Ok, back to the beginning, this is your assignment right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對 我記得這個句子, 當我得到這個句子時 我並不知道他的英文怎麼說, 妳也知道有些中文字對外國人來說真的非常難以辨認, 我需要一些協助所以才跟我同是協助, 我叫他幫我翻譯這個句子然後再用訊息傳給我

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	You mean because you asked your colleague about the sentence in Chinese so that’s why she sent it to you in English? So the message was simply an answer for the assignment right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對  那只是作業的答案

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	So now, we’ll see page 14 and 16 in the invest gory file, please check the content. So the colleague sent you these messages because you have problem finishing your assignments.

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對  所有訊息的目的都一樣是幫助我完成功課

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So upon your wife’s lawsuit against your colleague 王彩文 what do you say about that?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得我太太真的想太多了, 我知道她對於我負擔家計的能力感到不滿足, 我希望庭上能了解她對我的學習從來沒有任何支持, 她根本不想幫助我完成我的學業, 她如果能支持我我根本不會找我的同事來幫助我我覺得這些誤會應該怪我太太

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, there seems to be some quarrels between you and your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們新婚的時候我們確實有一些美好時光, 但工作就是一個大問題, 我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文但我的時數不夠, 所以工作就變成我們爭吵的課題我們三不五時就為這吵架, 她不認為我有努力的付出, 所以她完成無法了解我辛苦的付出

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Ok, back to the master program we talked about. When did you start your master program? Did you get the degree and are you done with it?

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我在2010年的春天開始這個課程, 這是兩年的課程, 我原本應該在2012年的12月完成學位, 可是因為工作忙碌的關係, 我並沒有足夠的時間來完成學位要求的一些作業, 就像我說的我太太一直都不支持我, 我覺得我好像自己一個人在為這個學位努力, 我既疲累又身心俱疲.

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So the duration of this program is two years, but you didn’t finish it, why? 

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法達成學位所有要求的課程

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	So when was the last registration of this semester?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是2012年的秋天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you said about the last registration, it ends on the fifth of December 2012, so after that, you shouldn’t have anything to do with the program right? But the text message between you and your colleague continued six months after your program, and why’s that?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	就算我沒有拿到學位, 我也想增進我的中文能力啊, 就算沒拿到學位我也想增進我的中文能力, 所以我精益求精的學中文

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean even if you didn’t get the degree, you still want to continue to practice your Chinese, is that true?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	對  所以我才求助於我的同事

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleague is like your tutor huh?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是個家教而已, 她是個真正的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	不, 我想要付她錢, 但她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	So if you didn’t pay her, why did she continue to send you these text messages even in sleeping hours? Don’t you think that your relationship was beyond coworkers?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	如我所說她是非常挺我的朋友, 她用自己的時間來幫助我學中文

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teach in the same cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	對, 我還在那工作

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	And your colleague王彩燕, does she still work in the same cram school?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那裏工作, 但我們已經不一起搭檔了

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	Is there any other evidence or witness? Prosecutor?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena the defendant’s colleague to the court to witness for this case. So she can clarify about her relationship with the defendant and her purpose of sending those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Is there any other evidence that the plaintiff wish the court to investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school took actions for the relationship of my husband and 王彩燕. The cram school even tried to persuade 王彩燕 to quit the job. Is it possible to ask the cram school whether this is true or not?

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	Defendant, do you want the court to investigate any evidence that could help you?Well, the point is your master program should have end on the 5th of December 2012. There’s no reason to keep contact with 王彩燕 because of the assignment right? Especially, you two usually send text message after 9 PM and that’s a little bit weird. Do you have any evidence that could help you?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我不認為庭上有任何能幫助我的證據, 如我所說, 我和我同事連絡的目的非常簡單, 只是想提升我的語言能力繼續進修中文

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	Ok, we will have our witness on the ninth of June 2014 for the witness procedure. Plaintiff and defendant, both of you have to show up on that date. If necessary, you can hire an attorney, do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Ok, we dismiss the court.

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 簡易字2887號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解。

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇案件之準備程序。告訴人陳玉華提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生John Anderston跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事王彩燕進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure for the adultery case. The plaintiff, Ms. 陳玉華 filed the case. The reason is that her husband John Anderson has intimate relationship with his colleague. Besides, the plaintiff found that there are some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphone. Plus, the defendant has often made up reasons for working overtime or chatting with his colleague, Ms. 王彩燕, in the middle of the night via tele-conferencing or other ways. The contents of the messages collected by the plaintiff are considered beyond co-workers’ relationship. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this case. The defendant, simply speaking, your wife doubts that you have an affair and accused you of adultery. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯，當然。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，目的是為了釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the major purpose is to ask about the details of phone records between the defendant and his colleague.The purpose is to clarity whether the defendant truly has an affair with his colleague and constitute adultery. Do both parties understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，你跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, I will ask the plaintiff some questions. How long have you been married to your husband? Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for four years, and we don't have children.

zh-TW	那你跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的？
en-US	Did you marry your husband abroad or in Taiwan?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	 I met my husband in Taiwan. Four years ago, he came to Taiwan and mainly wanted to teach Portuguese. 

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	For past few years, is hid job here to teach Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher.After we got married, he had kept teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so his teaching hours were unstable. Sometimes, there would be a period of one or two months between two teaching courses. Later on, to make his income more stable, he wanted to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. Do you mean that he would like to pursue a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, he wanted to teach English in Taiwan, so he had to receive a degree of TESOL. He found a distance learning program offered by California in the United States online. Therefore, he could complete the course requirements by the means of online learning without going to the United States in person. After receiving all the credits, he could receive a master degree. His plan is that with such a degree offered by the United States, he can find a position as an English teacher in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What is the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	The cram school partner a foreign teacher with a Chinese teacher for teaching, and that woman is his teaching partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know your husband has an affair with his colleague?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At the beginning, I just noticed that my husband often worked overtime at the cram school. I have asked him several times. Why does he have to work overtime at a cram school? He told me that because he had to partner with a Chinese teacher for teaching, many details have to be discussed. 一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，I truly had no doubts on his saying at first. However, I later found out that after he arrived home, he frequently received calls. In addition, he never answered the calls in front of me. Instead, he would go to the study room to talk on the phone. That made me suspect him, so I checked his cellphone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Do you find anything unusual in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I often saw a certain set of numbers in the records of his phone book, so I checked his messages out of curiosity. Then I found that he has texted with a woman almost every single day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不宜嗎？
en-US	Is it actually all right with texting messages, right? Is the content very inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人，怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢? 之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If they are common messages, it is fine. However, he is married. How could that woman always send him some intimate sentences? Earlier on, I have provided the court with some contents of their messages. They should be in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please show the file one, page 13. There are some contents of several messages. The defendant, please verify whether the messages are from your cellphone?

en-US	Yes, this is a message on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這些是我手機裡的簡訊。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國101年11月31日21點50分，由手機0958-932***發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	 I have some questions for you based on these messages. The first message was sent at 9:50 at night on November 31st in 2012 from the number 0958932 and so on. The content said that “I really miss you, my love.”What does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care. 
zh-TW	這的確是我同事傳的簡訊。她只是關心我、擔心我，所以發簡訊給我。我同事在美國受教育的，她思想很西化，這就是她說話、表達情感的方式。至於「我的愛」一詞，這只是對我們關心的人的稱呼而已。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	You said that the sender was educated abroad, so her thoughts are quite westernised, and the way she expresses herself is more open, so the word “my love”does not carry any special meaning, right?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other. 
zh-TW	對，這只是一種普遍稱呼好朋友和關心的人的方式而已。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	And the sentence in front?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me.
zh-TW	像我說的，她只是關心我，我們是工作夥伴。當我休假兩天的時候，她當然會想我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊，因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because you were off for two days, she sent you such a message, and because without your assistance in the courses, she missed you so much? Is that it?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal
zh-TW	這就是簡訊內容，並沒有什麼特別的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國102年1月13日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	And the second message was sent at 11:55 at night on January 13th, 2013 via the same phone number. The content was that “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?”What does that mean? Why did the sender text you such a message?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她只是告訴我作業中的一句中文怎麼寫而已。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	Do you mean that she sent you this message only for helping you complete your assignment? What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court. I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	像我太太剛剛告訴法院的，我在修一個碩士課程。課程中，我必須完成三十個學分才能拿到學位。我當然必須完成一些作業和習題。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	 Could you elaborate    what you exactly study for your master’s degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我修的是英語教學，有些課和英語教學有關，有些跟文化和語言能力有關。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程是嗎？
en-US	So you study a master program on TESOL, and some courses are related to culture communications, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得至少有三門課和文化溝通有關

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What kind of assignments were be given by such courses of culture and communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這些文化溝通課程的作業因學生而異。以我自己為例。我住在台灣，想要找到教英文的工作。為了達成這個目標，並精進語文能力，我必須有好的中文能力。因此，我有很多作業跟中英翻譯有關。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because you planned to teach English in Taiwan, this program requires you to prove you have a certain level of Chinese ability? And therefore, you have to complete some assignments give by the courses, which is sentence translation? Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	對的，我當然必須精進我的口說和寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	All right, let’s go back to that sentence. You said that was your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，我記得這個句子。我剛開始不知道那些中文句子用英文該怎麼說。有些中文字對外國人來說很難認。我需要一些協助，所以請同事幫我。我請她幫我翻譯句子，用簡訊傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you asked your colleague how to say that sentence in Chinese, and she texted you the answer? Is that the scenario? In other words, the content of the message is only the answer to the assignment, right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	簡訊內容就是我的作業答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16業的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Then please show the contents of all the messages on page 14 to page 16 in the file one. Please verify the messages. Is it because that you has to do your assignments and ask for help from your colleague, asking her to send you messages?

en-US	 Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，所有簡訊都是為了幫助我完成作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事王彩燕有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Your wife just said that you have an affair with your colleague, 王彩燕, what is your explanation? 

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for all this misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的想太多了！我想她只是不滿意我賺錢的能力。我想告訴庭上，我太太從一開始就完全不支持我念碩士，她並不願意幫助我完成學業。如果她願意支持我一點點，我不會請同事幫忙。我覺得她自己應該為這誤解負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your saying, there are some unpleasant situations between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	剛結婚的時候，我們的確渡過了一段美好時光，但是問題出在我的工作。我想要在台灣教葡萄牙文，但是授課時數很不穩定，所以我的工作就成了我們之間的問題。我們常常為這個問題吵架。她不相信我已經盡力了，我也無法讓她理解我遇到的挫折和困難。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Well, let’s go back to the master program, which you just talked about. When did you start your program, and does it end? Did you receive the degree? 

en-US	I first started the program in Spring 2010. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in December 2012. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我的碩士課程從2010年春天開始，是兩年的課程，應該要在2012年12月完成課程。但是我沒有完成課程，因為我有兼差，沒有時間完成我的課程作業。像我說的，我太太並不支持我。我覺得是自己一路單獨奮鬥，感覺很累、很有挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	Do you mean that the program should have lasted for two years, but you did not complete it, and why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成所有的課程要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，是什麼時候結束的呢?
en-US	What did it end, the last semester that you registered? 

en-US	The last semester of my registration was fall 2012.
zh-TW	我註冊的最後一個學期是在2012年秋季。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國101年12月5日，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何作業了吧?但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束六個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If as you said, your last semester ended on December 5th in 2012, based on reasonable doubts, you would have no assignments after that, right? How would you continue sending messages with your colleagues even until six months after the program was ended?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我也許無法完成課程，但不代表我不想精進語言能力。即使我不能完成課程，我還是很想加強我的中文能力，所以我繼續自我學習。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that even though  you failed to complete the master program, you still want to sharpen your Chinese ability and make your Chinese more fluent, right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help.
zh-TW	是，我請同事幫忙。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So that colleague plays a role as a tutor, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不僅是個家教，也是我真正的好友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎？
en-US	Have you offered her any pay?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我想要付她錢，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you had not paid her, why would she like to send you messages to answer your questions even in the middle of the night, when she should go to bed for sleep?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese. 
zh-TW	因此我認為她是非常支持我的，她用自己的時間幫助我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still work as an English teacher at that cram school now?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there.
zh-TW	是的，我還在那裡工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事王彩燕也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is that colleague, 王彩燕, still working there, too?

en-US	She is also still working there but we don’t team up any more. 
zh-TW	她也還在那裡工作，但我們不再是工作夥伴了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any further evidence to be investigated or people to be subpoenaed? 

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職伯元補習班的王彩燕以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	We would like to subpoena the colleague of the defendant, 王彩燕, as a witness to the court to elaborate her relationship with the defendant and the background as well as the purpose of writing these messages?

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The plaintiff, do you want the court to investigate any evidence for you?

zh-TW	我聽說該補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女王彩燕離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I have heard that the cram school has taken some actions because of their relationship. The cram school even tried to persuade Ms. 王彩燕 to leave the job position. I am wandering whether we can verify these facts with the cram school.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國101年12月05日結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟王彩燕的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據，可以幫助自己的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence that you want the court to investigate for you? The current situation is that your master program was ended on December 5th, 2012, and there are no reasons for you to take completing assignments as an excuse to explain the interaction of texting messages between you and 王彩燕, especially your interactions were mostly after 9 o’clock at night. This behaviour causes doubts. Do you have any evidence that can help you with your case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and me was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我無法想到有任何證據是法院可以代表我調查的。如我所說，我和同事間的溝通很簡單。我只是想要精進中文能力，繼續學習中文。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國103年06月09日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court date is set at 4:30 in the afternoon on June 9th, 2014 for asking the witness. The plaintiff and the defendant, please do  come on that day. If necessary, the both parties have the right to hire lawyers. Do you understand?

zh-TW	我明白。
en-US	 I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我明白。

zh-TW	今天庭期到此結束。
en-US	Today’s court ends here.

zh-TW	今為偵字1415號 妨害名譽案件之準備程序
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure of defamation, case number 1415

zh-TW	通譯宣讀 「通譯結文：今為貴院1415號 妨害名譽案件之準備程序為通譯，謹當為公正誠實之譯述，此結，通譯○○○，中華民國109年7月22日。」

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	I’m going to inform your right and your obligation.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	You have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權雇用法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民或其他符合法律規定者，得請求法律服務。
en-US	You have the right to a lawyer. If you come from a low-income family, a medium-and-low income family, or if you are an aborigine or meet other qualification set by the law, you may ask the court for legal assistance.

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	You have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence favorable to your case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your right

en-US	Yes, I do.
zh-TW	是的，我了解。

zh-TW	請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
en-US	The prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	As stated in the indictment.

zh-TW	被告因妨害名譽案件被檢察官起訴，起因是被告涉嫌在中華民國108年12月1日到109年1月20日之間，在網際網路論壇，名為Foreign Land (外國園地)，發表一連串的評論，雖此論壇之主要目的是提供在台居留外國人士交流之平台，但被告卻利用這樣一個平台進行對告訴人公司之批評，致使告訴人公司名譽受損。對此妨害名譽之告訴，有何辯解？
en-US	This incident happened on December 1, 2019 to January 20, 2020. The accused post the comments on the internet chat forum, Foreign Land, which provides foreigners in Taiwan to communicate with others. However, the accused used this platform to criticize the accuser’s company, which damaged the accuser’s company reputation, so the accused was prosecuted. What’s your plea?

en-US	I plead not guilty.
zh-TW	我沒有罪。

zh-TW	請問你知道「外國園地」這個論壇嗎？
en-US	The defendant, do you know the Internet forum, Foreign Land

en-US	Yes, Foreign Land is a forum very popular among foreigners.
zh-TW	我知道這個Foreign Land非常受歡迎，尤其是在外國人當中。

zh-TW	可以簡要的描述你在這個平台上的活動嗎？
en-US	Can you summarize your activities on Foreign Land?

en-US	I am a registered member, which means I can read others’ posts and post articles for others to read.
zh-TW	我是有註冊的會員，我可以看到別人發表的文章，同時也可以發表自己的文章給別人看。

zh-TW	你常常在上面發表文章嗎，可以大概抓個頻率嗎，大概多久發表一篇文章？
en-US	How often you post comments on the Foreign Land? ...

en-US	I won’t say I regularly post articles on Foreign Land. I only have postings when I want to share some concerns or vent my feelings. 
zh-TW	我不會說我常常在上面發文，我只有在我有一些疑慮，還有想要發洩一些情緒的時候才會在上面發文。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)65頁。這一頁是取自中華民國108年12月13日在「外國園地」中發表的內容。請你看一下，這是你寫的嗎？
en-US	… The page is about your comments on Foreign Land on December 13, 2019. Please take a look. Are these your posts?

en-US	It seems to be my posting but it was posted some time ago, I am not sure if the article is in its entirety.
zh-TW	我有發表這個文章，但是是在很久之前發表的，所以我不確定文章的完整性。

zh-TW	你在文中所提到的主要內容為何？請陳述。
en-US	Please describe the main content

en-US	As you can see from the copy, I posted some concerns and questions regarding Winwin company, especially about how foreigners were treated by that company.
zh-TW	…我在上面發表了我的疑慮、對公司的一些問題，還有他們怎麼對待外國員工。

zh-TW	你剛剛講到的某一公司，請問有在任何一篇文章當中，明確指出該公司的全名嗎？
en-US	You mentioned the full name of the company. Did you point out its name in any comments?

en-US	Yes, I am sure I have used the company’s full name, Winwin.
zh-TW	我確定我有在上面用公司的全名，贏贏。

zh-TW	你在65頁的內容中，提到該公司常常在雇用外國人時，沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利，更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況。請問，你這樣講，有證據嗎？
en-US	In Page 65, you mentioned this company hired foreign employee without following Labor Basic Law about work time, basic wage and benefits. The company didn’t help foreigners apply for working visa. For this, do you have any evidence?

en-US	I did mention those issues. I did not have evidence. I heard those issues from some other foreign friends who either worked for that company or had experiences with that company. As a result, I expressed my concerns in the question format, meaning I asked all those questions regarding working hours, basic salary, benefits and ARC application with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions.
zh-TW	我有講過這個問題，但我沒有證據。我是從我一些在那個公司工作的朋友或是在那邊有經驗的朋友聽來的。我有在論壇發表一些問題，包含了工作時數、基本薪資、福利，還有是否幫員工申請居留簽證…。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你是從其他外國朋友那邊聽到這些細節，但不是本人的第一手資料，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that you heard from you friends, but it isn’t your first-hand information, right?

en-US	True. I heard those details from other friends, also the registered members of Foreign Land.
zh-TW	沒錯，我是從朋友還有一些註冊會員那邊聽到這些小細節的。

zh-TW	那你怎麼可以在一個公開的論壇中，直接把聽來的東西，就做了轉述呢？
en-US	How could you repost this information on Foreign Land?

en-US	I didn’t quote others and post the concerns as accusations. Instead, all my comments were questions. I was hoping Winwin would provide some sort of clarifications so that the foreign community would not hold any wrong ideas against that company.
zh-TW	我沒有直接引用，我只是發表言論、提出我的問題。我只是希望贏贏公司可以釐清這些問題，讓外國人不會對這家公司有誤解。

zh-TW	什麼叫做你都是用問題的方式來進行批評？可以解釋一下嗎？
en-US	What do you mean that you criticize in questions? Can you explain it?

en-US	For example, I asked in one posting “Is it true that Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC, the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally?”. 
zh-TW	舉例來說，我發表了一個問題，就是那個公司有沒有幫外國人申請居留證，外國人可以合法居留嗎?

zh-TW	所以你發表這一系列文章的目的只是為了釐清所謂的「真相」，是嗎？
en-US	So, you posted a series of comments just in order to find out the truth?

en-US	Yes, I only wanted to get some clarifications or explanations. However, instead of responding to my questions directly, Winwin chose to file this lawsuit against me.
zh-TW	是的，我只是想要得到一些澄清和解釋。然而，這個公司沒有直接回答我的問題，而是對我提出告訴。

zh-TW	雖然告訴人有提供他們自外國園地抓下來文章內容，但他們也告訴檢方，這些內容並不完整。所以就你記憶所及，你大概連續發表了幾篇呢？
en-US	Although the accuser provided some comments from Foreign Land and told the police, but the content wasn’t entire. …

en-US	As I stated before, it has been some time already. I cannot recall exactly how many articles I posted on Foreign Land, perhaps eight to ten? The problem is when this lawsuit began, the administrator of Foreign Land decided to delete my postings to avoid trouble. 
zh-TW	我之前說過的，那些文章已經發表一段時間了，所以我不能明確告訴你我發了多少文章到論壇，也許是8到10篇。問題是當他們提出告訴後，版主就把我的文章全部刪除，以免造成麻煩。

zh-TW	你的意思是說當這個訴訟開始進行的時候，那個論壇的版主就進行了刪文的動作嗎？
en-US	You mean when the lawsuit began, the administrator of the forum deleted all of your posts, right?

en-US	Yes, that is correct.
zh-TW	是這樣沒錯。

zh-TW	也就是說，你完全沒有辦法確定你一共為此事件發表過幾篇文章？
en-US	That is, you can’t assure how many comments you posted, right?

en-US	That’s correct, too.
zh-TW	這樣也沒錯。

zh-TW	那就你記憶所及，你曾經接到過該公司任何希望你停止批評他們的要求嗎？你有照做嗎？
en-US	Did you remember that the company asked you to stop criticizing? Did you stop posting comments?

en-US	I think towards the end of my postings, I did get a request from Winwin, asking me to stop posting articles about their company. I didn’t stop immediately because, again, I was only asking questions.
zh-TW	我認為如果要我停止發文的話，我應該會收到一些叫我停止發文的請求，我沒有立即停止，因為就像我前面所說的，我只是問問題而已。

zh-TW	所以你還是堅持，因為你都是用問題的方式來發表評論，並沒有直接毀謗該公司名譽的事實，是嗎？
en-US	So, you mean you insist on posting comments in question, but not libeling the company, right?

en-US	It was never my intention to defame Winwin. I don’t quite understand how a series of questions could possibly constitute “defamation.”
zh-TW	我從來都不是故意要毀謗這個公司，我不懂為什麼問問題會造成毀謗。

zh-TW	那請問告訴人，貴公司是什麼時候開始瞭解到，在「外國園地」當中，有關於貴公司的文章？
en-US	Now, I’m going to ask accuser some questions. Accuser, when do you realize that some comments are posted on Foreign Land about your company?

en-US	This issue first came to our attention around December 2019. My wife and I personally were not active in that kind of forums. We were only informed by some friends about the malicious comments on Foreign Land until then.
zh-TW	我第一次知道此事是在2019年12月。我和我老婆在這樣的論壇並不活躍。我們是在那時才被朋友告知有這些惡意評論。

zh-TW	對於剛剛被告表示他只是提出一連串的問題，希望貴公司回答這些問題，並沒有以陳述方式毀謗貴公司的名譽。你有何意見？
en-US	According to the accused, he just posted a series of questions and hoped that the company can respond to him. He didn’t say something directly to defame your company. Did you have any opinion?

en-US	That’s not true. In English, even when comments are made in the question format, they still carry enough force to make readers wonder or question the facts implied by the questions. Even when the defendant said he only asked questions, damage was done to my company. 
zh-TW	這不是事實。在英文表達中，即使用問題方式評論，也能讓閱讀的人產生好奇或質疑事實。即使被告說他只是問問題，也足以毀謗我的公司。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，不管對方是否用問題方式提出質疑，你們公司的名譽實際上都有所損害嗎？請解釋一下。
en-US	Do you meant that whether the other party posted the questions, the company has been defamed? Can you explain?

en-US	Yes, when the defendant asked those questions, it caused doubt and suspicion in the circle of foreigners in Taiwan. Foreigners form their own circle here in Taiwan and rumors travel fast. That’s why even the Labor Bureau paid several visits to our company, trying to find out if we were involved in the matters posted on Foreign Land.
zh-TW	是的。當被告問了這些問題，就能讓這些住在台灣的外國人懷疑這間公司。這些外國人在這個論壇裡自成一圈。在這圈子裡，謠言傳得非常快。這就是爲什麼勞工局多次造訪我的公司，來看這些評論中的問題是否真的存在。

zh-TW	那勞工局前往貴公司瞭解外國人的雇用狀況，以及居留證的申請細節，有發現什麼不符合的地方嗎？
en-US	When the Labor Bureau went to the company to understand the situation of hiring the foreigner and their application of ARC, did anything happen which didn’t meet the requirements?

en-US	No, the representatives from the Bureau came but did not find anything wrong with our company or our hiring practice. 
zh-TW	沒有，勞工局派的代表並沒有查到任何不符規定的事。

zh-TW	如果勞工局的調查並沒有發現什麼不妥之處，或是違法之處，再加上剛剛被告也解釋，他撰寫這些文章的目的都只是希望貴公司能夠進行自清的動作，有沒有可能雙方進行和解呢？
en-US	If the Labor Bureau didn’t find anything which is illegal or not appropriate, just like the accused explained that he wrote these articles only to hope that the company can clarify, can both parties consider settlement?

en-US	We previously tried but failed to reach any conclusion. I would only consider settling this case with two things from the defendant. First, he has to formally apologize to Winwin for posting those inappropriate comments on Foreign Land. Second, as he said he heard all those details from “other foreign friends,” he should provide the names of those people to clear his own name.
zh-TW	我們之前有試著調解，但失敗了。我可以考慮和解，但對被告有兩件事的要求。第一，他必須為他不妥言論，正式向我的公司道歉。第二，如他剛才所說他是從其他外國朋友中聽到這些消息，他必須提供這些朋友的全名

zh-TW	被告，就像剛剛告訴人所指出，如果要進行和解，他希望由你這邊採取兩個行動，第一，正式道歉，對於在外國園地所發表的文章，不論你的文章是否造成告訴人公司實質上的名譽受損，對方都希望你提出道歉。第二，你剛剛前面指出，你是從一些外國友人那邊，聽到告訴人公司有違法對待外國勞工之嫌，你可以提供這些友人的姓名嗎？
en-US	The accused, just like accuser said, if you want a settlement, you need to take two actions. First, you need to apologize formally. For the comments you posted on Foreign Land, whether they constituted defamation, you need to apologize. Second, you have mentioned that you heard these things from your foreign friend. The company treated the employees illegally. Can you provide the names of your friends?

en-US	No, I would not consider these terms. First of all, I don’t know why I should apologize for posting some questions on the Internet. Since when is asking questions a crime? Second, Winwin cannot agree to settle the case with the term of obtaining names from me. This is not right.
zh-TW	不，我拒絕接受這些條件。第一點，我不懂為什麼我要為這些言論道歉，什麼時候問問題也犯法？第二，他不應該要我公開這些外國朋友的全名。

zh-TW	如果被告堅持因為文章的書寫內容都是以問題的方式進行，並沒有要毀謗告訴人公司的意圖，這顯然在第一個部分，你就是拒絕道歉，是嗎？
en-US	The accused, you insist that you wrote the comments in questions, and you didn’t intend to defame the company, so you won’t apologize, right?

en-US	No, I will not consider making an apology.
zh-TW	對，我拒絕道歉。

zh-TW	對於告訴人的第二個要求，你也拒絕。是因為擔心告訴人公司會對那些人進行相關的法律訴訟，是嗎？
en-US	You also reject the second condition. Is that because you afraid that the company will file a lawsuit against your foreign friends?

en-US	The thing is that some of the friends used to or may be currently working for Winwin. How could I jeopardize them just for the sake of settling my own case? Why should they suffer the potential harm? 
zh-TW	我擔心那些曾在那邊工作或是目前在那工作的朋友受害。我怎麼可以出賣這些朋友，就因為我想達成和解？為什麼他們要遭到這些傷害？

zh-TW	如果雙方無法就和解進行任何退讓，那麼法院這邊只能將這一次的準備程序內容進行彙整，以便進行下一次的審理程序。雙方的辯護人，是不是能夠針對和解這個選擇，再跟你們的當事人談一談呢？
en-US	The accuser, if both parties cannot reach a settlement, the court will collect the details for preparatory procedure and have next trial procedure. Today both parties have their lawyers. The lawyers of both parties, can you negotiate with your clients about settlement?

zh-TW	報告庭上，其實之前我們就有跟被告溝通，既然他說他的消息都是聽自其他友人，他大可以直接把那些人的名字提供給我們，而讓這一次的訴訟事件告一段落，但被告的態度一直很不合作，所以我們這邊也就無法進行進一步的和解動作。
en-US	Dear judge, I am the lawyer of the accuser. We used to negotiate with the defendant. The defendant said he heard information from his friends. He can provide their full names, so this case will be dismissed here. However, the defendant didn’t want to cooperate so we couldn’t reach an agreement.

zh-TW	報告鈞院，其實我的當事人會有這樣的顧慮，最主要是因為告訴人公司雇用很多外國人士，我的當事人不希望因為提供友人姓名一事，而讓過去或目前為告訴人公司服務的外國人士，惹上不必要的麻煩。望請鈞院了解。
en-US	Dear judge, I am the lawyer of the accused. The reason why my client has these concerns is because the accuser’s company applies many foreign employees. My client doesn’t want to provide the names of his foreign friends because he doesn’t want his friends to get into trouble. Hope you can understand.

zh-TW	既然告訴人跟被告雙方對於和解都各自有堅持，本庭定中華民國109年8月14日上午11點整進行審理程序。
en-US	Because both parties don’t reach a settlement, so the date of the trial procedure will set at 11 a.m. on August 14, 2020.

zh-TW	 請問被告，有無需要法院進一步調查之證據？
en-US	The defendant, is there any evidence you want the court to investigate?

en-US	No, your honor.
zh-TW	沒有，親愛的法官大人。

zh-TW	那告訴人這邊呢？
en-US	The accuser, do you have any evidence you hope the court to investigate for you?

en-US	I will think about it. If anything comes up, I will ask my lawyer to place a request to the court.
zh-TW	如果我有想到任何問題，我會請律師告知庭上。

zh-TW	那針對下一次的庭期，我們就不再發傳票，而是直接在庭直接以橘色小卡進行通知。請在簽完今天的筆錄後，領取小卡，再行離開。
en-US	About the next court date, we will not issue the subpoena. We will give you orange cards to inform you. Please sign your statement… The court is dismissed today.

en-US	Yes, I do.
zh-TW	是的，我了解。

zh-TW	請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the details of the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	As stated in the indictment. 

zh-TW	被告因妨害名譽案件被檢察官起訴，起因是被告涉嫌在中華民國108年12月1日到109年1月20日之間，在網際網路論壇，名為Foreign Land (外國園地)，發表一連串的評論，雖此論壇之主要目的是提供在台居留外國人士交流之平台，但被告卻利用這樣一個平台進行對告訴人公司之批評，致使告訴人公司名譽受損。對此妨害名譽之告訴，有何辯解？
en-US	The defendant, you are prosecuted for defamation. The reason is because during umm… December 1st, 2019 to January 20th, 2020, you posted a thread of comments on the social media on the Internet called Foreign Land. This platform’s intention is to let foreigners who live in Taiwan to communicate with each other, but you used this platform to criticize the accuser’s company, and defamed the company. And damaged the company’s reputation. As for the defamation crime, what’s your plea?

en-US	I plead not guilty.
zh-TW	我沒有罪。

zh-TW	請問你知道「外國園地」這個論壇嗎？
en-US	Defendant, do you know the internet platform Foreign Land?

en-US	Yes, Foreign Land is a forum very popular among foreigners.
zh-TW	我知道，因為外國園地在外國人…在我們外國人之間是很受歡迎的論壇。

zh-TW	可以簡要的描述你在這個平台上的活動嗎？
en-US	Can you briefly your activities on this platform?

en-US	I am a registered member, which means I can read others’ posts and post articles for others to read.
zh-TW	我是有註冊的會員，就是我可以看別人的文章，我也可以發布文章讓其他人看。

zh-TW	你常常在上面發表文章嗎，可以大概抓個頻率嗎，大概多久發表一篇文章？
en-US	So, do you often post comments on this platform

en-US	I won’t say I regularly post articles on Foreign Land. I only have postings when I want to share some concerns or vent my feelings. 
zh-TW	我不會說我常常在上面發文，我只有在..我只有在我關心的事情或我想要抒發情緒的時候才會發。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)65頁。這一頁是取自中華民國108年12月13日在「外國園地」中發表的內容。請你看一下，這是你寫的嗎？
en-US	Next, I am going to inform the investigatory paper number 1 page 65. This page is from the comments on Foreign Land December 13th, 2019. Is this the comments you posted?

en-US	It seems to be my posting but it was posted some time ago, I am not sure if the article is in its entirety.
zh-TW	這個看起來像是我發的，但是在很久以前，所以我也沒有辦法確定文章的完整度。

zh-TW	你在文中所提到的主要內容為何？請陳述。
en-US	Please state what you posted… the content of what you posted.

en-US	As you can see from the copy, I posted some concerns and questions regarding Winwin company, especially about how foreigners were treated by that company.
zh-TW	就像你所看到的一樣，我..我發表了 對於文文公司的問題，然後揭露外國人在這家公司是怎麼被對待的。

zh-TW	你剛剛講到的某一公司，請問有在任何一篇文章當中，明確指出該公司的全名嗎？
en-US	You have mentioned the company’s name. Do you remember if you have posted the full name of the company in any of your posts?

en-US	Yes, I am sure I have used the company’s full name, Winwin.
zh-TW	恩對阿，我有用公司的本名，文文。

zh-TW	你在65頁的內容中，提到該公司常常在雇用外國人時，沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利，更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況。請問，你這樣講，有證據嗎？
en-US	As stated in page 65, you stated that this company when hiring foreigners, they didn’t follow the Basic Labor Law of paying basic wage, and the time and rights. And you also mentioned that the company didn’t apply for foreigner’s visa, is this true?

en-US	I did mention those issues. I did not have evidence. I heard those issues from some other foreign friends who either worked for that company or had experiences with that company. As a result, I expressed my concerns in the question format, meaning I asked all those questions regarding working hours, basic salary, benefits and ARC application with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions.
zh-TW	我的確有聽到這些問題，但我沒有證據。我是從曾經在那家公司工作過的外國人那邊聽到這些消息的。因此我發表了我的意見…我用問的方式發表我的意見，其中提到了這個公司的基本工時、工資還有居留證的問題，希望文文公司可以….看到並且改善。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你是從其他外國朋友那邊聽到這些細節，但不是本人的第一手資料，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that you heard this from foreigner friends and this information is not first hand?

en-US	True. I heard those details from other friends, also the registered members of Foreign Land.
zh-TW	沒錯，我是從朋友那邊聽來的，還有論壇上註冊的會員他們也這麼說。

zh-TW	那你怎麼可以在一個公開的論壇中，直接把聽來的東西，就做了轉述呢？
en-US	Then how can you… how can you post these comments on a public platform which is not first hand information?

en-US	I didn’t quote others and post the concerns as accusations. Instead, all my comments were questions. I was hoping Winwin would provide some sort of clarifications so that the foreign community would not hold any wrong ideas against that company.
zh-TW	我並沒有直接的….ㄟ…直接控告他所做的事情，我都用詢問的方式。我希望文文公司他們可以澄清這些不好的訊息，這樣子外國人也不會對他有不好的印象。

zh-TW	什麼叫做你都是用問題的方式來進行批評？可以解釋一下嗎？
en-US	What do you mean by you criticized by asking questions? Can you explain this?

en-US	For example, I asked in one posting “Is it true that Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC, the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally?”. 
zh-TW	舉例來說，我說文文公司他沒有幫外國人申請居留證……也就是在台灣工作的……..

zh-TW	所以你發表這一系列文章的目的只是為了釐清所謂的「真相」，是嗎？
en-US	So, the intention of you posting these comments is just to find out the truth?

en-US	Yes, I only wanted to get some clarifications or explanations. However, instead of responding to my questions directly, Winwin chose to file this lawsuit against me.
zh-TW	是的，我只是希望他可以澄清並且給大家一個交代。然而，文文公司不但沒有直接回答我的問題，反而是對我提起訴訟。

zh-TW	雖然告訴人有提供他們自外國園地抓下來文章內容，但他們也告訴檢方，這些內容並不完整。所以就你記憶所及，你大概連續發表了幾篇呢？
en-US	Although the accuser provided some comments from Foreign Land, they have said that these comments are not a whole. How many posts did you post on this platform?

en-US	As I stated before, it has been some time already. I cannot recall exactly how many articles I posted on Foreign Land, perhaps eight to ten? The problem is when this lawsuit began, the administrator of Foreign Land decided to delete my postings to avoid trouble. 
zh-TW	 就像我說過的，我偶爾會發，但是我沒有辦法確切記得我到底發了幾篇，我想大概是在8~10篇的範圍內，問題是當文文公司提起訴訟的時候，外國園地的版主決定刪掉我寫的那些文章來避免麻煩。

zh-TW	你的意思是說當這個訴訟開始進行的時候，那個論壇的版主就進行了刪文的動作嗎？
en-US	Do you mean after the lawsuit was filed, the administrator of Foreign Land just deleted all the posts?

en-US	Yes, that is correct.
zh-TW	沒有錯。

zh-TW	也就是說，你完全沒有辦法確定你一共為此事件發表過幾篇文章？
en-US	This also means that you cannot be sure that you posted… how many comments you posted about this incident, right?

en-US	That’s correct, too.
zh-TW	恩，你說的沒錯。

zh-TW	那就你記憶所及，你曾經接到過該公司任何希望你停止批評他們的要求嗎？你有照做嗎？
en-US	As far as you can remember, did the company tell you to stop your comments? And did you do so?

en-US	I think towards the end of my postings, I did get a request from Winwin, asking me to stop posting articles about their company. I didn’t stop immediately because, again, I was only asking questions.
zh-TW	沒錯，文文公司確實有要求我停止再發布這些文章，但我並沒有馬上停止這麼做，就像我說過的阿，我只是問問題而已。

zh-TW	所以你還是堅持，因為你都是用問題的方式來發表評論，並沒有直接毀謗該公司名譽的事實，是嗎？
en-US	So, the defendant, you mean you only criticized the company by asking questions and do not admit that you libeled the company, right?

en-US	It was never my intention to defame Winwin. I don’t quite understand how a series of questions could possibly constitute “defamation.”
zh-TW	妨害文文公司的名譽從來不是我的目的，我真的不能理解這些我問的問題會構成妨害名譽

zh-TW	那請問告訴人，貴公司是什麼時候開始瞭解到，在「外國園地」當中，有關於貴公司的文章？
en-US	Then I am going to ask the accuser some questions. So, the accuser, when do you realize that the accused post some articles on the Foreign Land about your company?

en-US	This issue first came to our attention around December 2019. My wife and I personally were not active in that kind of forums. We were only informed by some friends about the malicious comments on Foreign Land until then.
zh-TW	這個事件，我們公司第一次注意到這件事是在2019年的12月。我和我的老婆並沒有在那個論壇裡面很活躍。我們當時是被朋友告知有這些惡意的言論在該論壇上。

zh-TW	對於剛剛被告表示他只是提出一連串的問題，希望貴公司回答這些問題，並沒有以陳述方式毀謗貴公司的名譽。你有何意見？
en-US	Just.. as what the accused mentioned, he said that he just… he just post the article by asking questions instead of statement… instead of…instead of post the article in the form of statement.

en-US	That’s not true. In English, even when comments are made in the question format, they still carry enough force to make readers wonder or question the facts implied by the questions. Even when the defendant said he only asked questions, damage was done to my company. 
zh-TW	在英文裡面，即使是問問題的形式，文字也有足夠的力量可以讓閱讀的人覺得或懷疑那些事實。所以當被告說他用問問題的方式，也足以妨害我們公司的名譽。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，不管對方是否用問題方式提出質疑，你們公司的名譽實際上都有所損害嗎？請解釋一下。
en-US	Do you mean that, no matter…whether the accused use the …use the …the accused use …asking question form. Your …still be damage….

en-US	Yes, when the defendant asked those questions, it caused doubt and suspicion in the circle of foreigners in Taiwan. Foreigners form their own circle here in Taiwan and rumors travel fast. That’s why even the Labor Bureau paid several visits to our company, trying to find out if we were involved in the matters posted on Foreign Land.
zh-TW	是的，當被告她提出這些疑問的時候就在我們外國人的圈子裡面造成非常大的懷疑和不信任。外國人在台灣有自己的圈子，然後在這個圈子裏面有很多流言和消息都傳得很快。這就是為什麼台灣的勞工局多次造訪我們，也想要知道我們是否有捲進這起事件裡面。

zh-TW	那勞工局前往貴公司瞭解外國人的雇用狀況，以及居留證的申請細節，有發現什麼不符合的地方嗎？
en-US	So when the Labor Bureau come to your company, do they found out that your…the hiring conditions, ARC application is not reasonable?

en-US	No, the representatives from the Bureau came but did not find anything wrong with our company or our hiring practice. 
zh-TW	沒有，當勞工局的代表來的時候，他們沒有發現任何的問題。僱人方面也沒有任何問題。

zh-TW	如果勞工局的調查並沒有發現什麼不妥之處，或是違法之處，再加上剛剛被告也解釋，他撰寫這些文章的目的都只是希望貴公司能夠進行自清的動作，有沒有可能雙方進行和解呢？
en-US	So if the…if your hiring conditions and ARC application is…are nothing wrong. And the accused just hope that you can give a self-clarification. So will you consider to settle with him

en-US	We previously tried but failed to reach any conclusion. I would only consider settling this case with two things from the defendant. First, he has to formally apologize to Winwin for posting those inappropriate comments on Foreign Land. Second, as he said he heard all those details from “other foreign friends,” he should provide the names of those people to clear his own name.
zh-TW	我們之前已經嘗試過和解了，但我們沒有達到任何的協議。要我跟被告人進行和解，我有兩個條件。第一，他必須對文文公司提出非常的道歉。第二，他說他都是從其他外國朋友得知這些消息，所以他想要自清的話就需要提供這些人的全名。

zh-TW	被告，就像剛剛告訴人所指出，如果要進行和解，他希望由你這邊採取兩個行動，第一，正式道歉，對於在外國園地所發表的文章，不論你的文章是否造成告訴人公司實質上的名譽受損，對方都希望你提出道歉。第二，你剛剛前面指出，你是從一些外國友人那邊，聽到告訴人公司有違法對待外國勞工之嫌，你可以提供這些友人的姓名嗎？
en-US	The accused, just as what the accuser said, if you wan to settle, you need to take two actions that he requested. First, you need to apologize formally. According to your article, no matter…no matter the company…the company’s reputation was damaged, you need to apologize to them. Second, you said that you heard your friends tell you that the company…the company is illegal of the hiring rules. Can you provide those people’s name?

en-US	No, I would not consider these terms. First of all, I don’t know why I should apologize for posting some questions on the Internet. Since when is asking questions a crime? Second, Winwin cannot agree to settle the case with the term of obtaining names from me. This is not right.
zh-TW	不，我拒絕接受這兩個條件。第一，我不知道為什麼我只是發表一些評論就要道歉。從什麼時候開始問問題是一種罪? 第二，文文公司想要進行和解的方式是要公開我外國朋友的全名，我覺得這樣不合理。

zh-TW	如果被告堅持因為文章的書寫內容都是以問題的方式進行，並沒有要毀謗告訴人公司的意圖，這顯然在第一個部分，你就是拒絕道歉，是嗎？
en-US	The defendant, the accused, you insist that you just asking questions instead of Libel, so you refuse to apologize, right?

en-US	No, I will not consider making an apology.
zh-TW	對，我拒絕道歉。

zh-TW	對於告訴人的第二個要求，你也拒絕。是因為擔心告訴人公司會對那些人進行相關的法律訴訟，是嗎？
en-US	The reason why you refuse the second condition is because you afraid that the accuser will take a legal action against those foreign friends, right?

en-US	The thing is that some of the friends used to or may be currently working for Winwin. How could I jeopardize them just for the sake of settling my own case? Why should they suffer the potential harm? 
zh-TW	我擔心的是因為目前有人曾經或現在都還在文文公司工作。我怎麼可以出賣他們，就為了這個案子? 為什麼他們必須受到波及呢?

zh-TW	如果雙方無法就和解進行任何退讓，那麼法院這邊只能將這一次的準備程序內容進行彙整，以便進行下一次的審理程序。雙方的辯護人，是不是能夠針對和解這個選擇，再跟你們的當事人談一談呢？
en-US	The accuser…if the both parties cannot settle, we will consider…we will consider to…collect the information of this court and…have the next court. Today the both parties have their lawyers, so the lawyer of both parties, can you talk to your…clients about settlement?

zh-TW	報告庭上，其實之前我們就有跟被告溝通，既然他說他的消息都是聽自其他友人，他大可以直接把那些人的名字提供給我們，而讓這一次的訴訟事件告一段落，但被告的態度一直很不合作，所以我們這邊也就無法進行進一步的和解動作。
en-US	Your honor, I am the accuser’s lawyer. Your honor, we have actually negotiated with the accused. As he said, he only heard all these information from his foreigner friends, he could just provide the full names of these friends and the case would be closed. But the defendant is very uncooperative, so we cannot take a further step to settle this case.

zh-TW	報告鈞院，其實我的當事人會有這樣的顧慮，最主要是因為告訴人公司雇用很多外國人士，我的當事人不希望因為提供友人姓名一事，而讓過去或目前為告訴人公司服務的外國人士，惹上不必要的麻煩。望請鈞院了解。
en-US	Your honor, I’m the accused’s lawyer. The reason why my client is concerned is because there are many foreigners work in the company. My client didn’t…my client isn’t willing to provide his friends’ name just because he didn’t want those foreigners work in the company get into troubles. Please understand.

zh-TW	既然告訴人跟被告雙方對於和解都各自有堅持，本庭定中華民國109年8月14日上午11點整進行審理程序。
en-US	Since both parties have their own concerns and stances, the next court will be set at 11 o’clock on August 14th 2020. We will have a trial procedure

zh-TW	 請問被告，有無需要法院進一步調查之證據？
en-US	The accused, do you have evidence that need the court to help you investigate?

en-US	No, your honor.
zh-TW	沒有。

zh-TW	那告訴人這邊呢？
en-US	How about the accuser? Are there any evidence you want the court to investigate? 

en-US	I will think about it. If anything comes up, I will ask my lawyer to place a request to the court.
zh-TW	我會好好想想，如果有想到任何東西的話，我會請我的律師告知庭上。

zh-TW	那針對下一次的庭期，我們就不再發傳票，而是直接在庭直接以橘色小卡進行通知。請在簽完今天的筆錄後，領取小卡，再行離開。
en-US	So we will not give both of you the subpoena, we will inform you by orange card. Please leave after you sign the statement and remember to take the cards. Today’s court is dismissed.

en-US	The defendant, you are prosecuted of violating an internet defamation. On December 1, 2019 to January 20, 2020, you were at an internet chatroom and you posted some comments. Although the purpose of this platform is to let some foreigners staying in Taiwan to exchange their thoughts. However, you posted some comments to criticize the accuser’s company, to damage the accuser’s reputation. What’s your plea?

en-US	I plead not guilty.
zh-TW	我沒有罪。

zh-TW	請問你知道「外國園地」這個論壇嗎？
en-US	I’m going to inquire the accused.The accused, do you know the forum of “Foreign Land”?

en-US	Yes, Foreign Land is a forum very popular among foreigners.
zh-TW	對啊，因為外國園地在外國人間是很受歡迎的。

zh-TW	可以簡要的描述你在這個平台上的活動嗎？
en-US	Could you briefly describe your activities on this forum?

en-US	I am a registered member, which means I can read others’ posts and post articles for others to read.
zh-TW	我是一個已經註冊的會員，所以我可以看到他人的貼文以及我自己也可以發布貼文與他人分享

zh-TW	你常常在上面發表文章嗎，可以大概抓個頻率嗎，大概多久發表一篇文章？
en-US	How often do you post a feed?

en-US	I won’t say I regularly post articles on Foreign Land. I only have postings when I want to share some concerns or vent my feelings. 
zh-TW	我不會說我有一個發文的頻率。我只在我關心些議題或想抒發感受的時候才會發文。

zh-TW	提示偵券(一)65頁。這一頁是取自中華民國108年12月13日在「外國園地」中發表的內容。請你看一下，這是你寫的嗎？
en-US	Now I’m going to read the investigation procedure page 65.This page describes a content from Foreign Land on December 13, 2019. Is this post written by you?

en-US	It seems to be my posting but it was posted some time ago, I am not sure if the article is in its entirety.
zh-TW	這篇好像是我寫的但是因為已經是一段時間以前的了，所以我不太確定這篇的完整性。

zh-TW	你在文中所提到的主要內容為何？請陳述。
en-US	Could you please state the main idea to the court?

en-US	As you can see from the copy, I posted some concerns and questions regarding Winwin company, especially about how foreigners were treated by that company.
zh-TW	就像你們可以看到的這篇貼文，我在上頭寫了一些我的疑慮以及問題，關於雙贏這個公司它們是怎麼對待外國人的。

zh-TW	你剛剛講到的某一公司，請問有在任何一篇文章當中，明確指出該公司的全名嗎？
en-US	You just mention company’s name, and did you state clearly of the company’s full name on any posts?

en-US	Yes, I am sure I have used the company’s full name, Winwin.
zh-TW	是的，我很確定我有用雙贏公司的全名。

zh-TW	你在65頁的內容中，提到該公司常常在雇用外國人時，沒有照勞基法的規定提供基本工時、工資、福利，更不時有未幫外國人申請工作簽證的情況。請問，你這樣講，有證據嗎？
en-US	You mentioned in page 65 that when the company is hiring a foreigner, they often violate the Basic Labor Law, the basic labor hour, and wage and welfare.Moreover, you mention that, from time to time when the company isn’t applying the working VISA for the foreign, do you have any evidence regarding this?

en-US	I did mention those issues. I did not have evidence. I heard those issues from some other foreign friends who either worked for that company or had experiences with that company. As a result, I expressed my concerns in the question format, meaning I asked all those questions regarding working hours, basic salary, benefits and ARC application with the hope that Winwin would come forward to respond to my questions.
zh-TW	我有提到這件事情但我還沒有證據。我有從一些外國朋友口中聽說，而那些朋友都是在公司工作或是和那些人交手過的。所以我用問問題的方式來表達我的想法，我的意思是我的問題都是有關勞基法、基本工時、基本薪資以及福利，以及雙贏公司是怎麼對外國居留證申請的方式，所以我希望他們可以出面澄清這個問題。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，你是從其他外國朋友那邊聽到這些細節，但不是本人的第一手資料，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you obtain this information from other friends, and these details are not firsthand information, right?

en-US	True. I heard those details from other friends, also the registered members of Foreign Land.
zh-TW	沒錯我就是從其他外國朋友那邊聽來的，以及從外國園地的註冊會員。

zh-TW	那你怎麼可以在一個公開的論壇中，直接把聽來的東西，就做了轉述呢？
en-US	So how can you in such public forum and directly state what you have heard on the post?

en-US	I didn’t quote others and post the concerns as accusations. Instead, all my comments were questions. I was hoping Winwin would provide some sort of clarifications so that the foreign community would not hold any wrong ideas against that company.
zh-TW	我並沒有引述其他人說的話在我的貼文當中，也不是控告的形式，我只是用問題的方式呈現。我只是希望雙贏公司可以提供某些形式的澄清，所以在我們的社群當中，才不會給外國人有錯誤的印象。

zh-TW	什麼叫做你都是用問題的方式來進行批評？可以解釋一下嗎？
en-US	What do you mean by asking questions? Could you explain further?

en-US	For example, I asked in one posting “Is it true that Winwin sometimes does not help foreign employees to apply for an ARC, the legal working permit they need for working in Taiwan legally?”. 
zh-TW	舉例來說，我曾在一篇貼文問說，雙贏公司是否真的沒有幫助外國人申請居留證，也就是他們可以合法在台工作的權利。

zh-TW	所以你發表這一系列文章的目的只是為了釐清所謂的「真相」，是嗎？
en-US	So your purposes of this post are finding out the truth, right?

en-US	Yes, I only wanted to get some clarifications or explanations. However, instead of responding to my questions directly, Winwin chose to file this lawsuit against me.
zh-TW	是的，我只想要得到他們的澄清或解釋。然而，他們並沒有直接的回應我，雙贏公司選擇了控告我的方式。

zh-TW	雖然告訴人有提供他們自外國園地抓下來文章內容，但他們也告訴檢方，這些內容並不完整。所以就你記憶所及，你大概連續發表了幾篇呢？
en-US	Although the accuser provide some articles contents, they have informed that these informations are not complete. How many post have you posts?

en-US	As I stated before, it has been some time already. I cannot recall exactly how many articles I posted on Foreign Land, perhaps eight to ten? The problem is when this lawsuit began, the administrator of Foreign Land decided to delete my postings to avoid trouble. 
zh-TW	就像我之前說過的，這些貼文已經有段時間了，就我記憶所及，大概只能想起來我大概發了8到10篇。問題是，當他們對我提出告訴時，版主就會刪除這些文章來避免不必要的麻煩。

zh-TW	你的意思是說當這個訴訟開始進行的時候，那個論壇的版主就進行了刪文的動作嗎？
en-US	What you meant was when the lawsuit came to effect, the administrator will delete all the post?

en-US	Yes, that is correct.
zh-TW	沒錯。

zh-TW	也就是說，你完全沒有辦法確定你一共為此事件發表過幾篇文章？
en-US	That is you still aren’t that sure how many post you have posted upon this issue?

en-US	That’s correct, too.
zh-TW	也沒錯。

zh-TW	那就你記憶所及，你曾經接到過該公司任何希望你停止批評他們的要求嗎？你有照做嗎？
en-US	In your memory, did the company send you any requirement or warning to stop posting?

en-US	I think towards the end of my postings, I did get a request from Winwin, asking me to stop posting articles about their company. I didn’t stop immediately because, again, I was only asking questions.
zh-TW	在我停止發文之前，都沒有收到任何要我停止發文的消息。我沒有立即停止發文，因為就像我之前所說的，我只是在問問題而已。

zh-TW	所以你還是堅持，因為你都是用問題的方式來發表評論，並沒有直接毀謗該公司名譽的事實，是嗎？
en-US	So the defendant, you still insist that you are posting in the form of posting questions, instead of directly libeling the company to damage their reputation. Is that right?

en-US	It was never my intention to defame Winwin. I don’t quite understand how a series of questions could possibly constitute “defamation.”
zh-TW	我從來就沒有想過要妨害雙贏公司的名譽。我還是不太了解一連串的問題會構成妨害名譽或毀謗。

zh-TW	那請問告訴人，貴公司是什麼時候開始瞭解到，在「外國園地」當中，有關於貴公司的文章？
en-US	Next I will ask the plaintiff some questions. Plaintiff, when did you find that there are some comments about your company?

en-US	This issue first came to our attention around December 2019. My wife and I personally were not active in that kind of forums. We were only informed by some friends about the malicious comments on Foreign Land until then.
zh-TW	這些問題主要首次是在2019年12月我們有意識到。我跟我老婆一開始並沒有在這個論壇上很活躍。我們是在朋友跟我們告知有這些惡意的評論之後才意識到這件事情。

zh-TW	對於剛剛被告表示他只是提出一連串的問題，希望貴公司回答這些問題，並沒有以陳述方式毀謗貴公司的名譽。你有何意見？
en-US	The defendent said that he didn‘t he just wrote the comment in the form of asking questions instead of statements. About this, what’s your idea?

en-US	That’s not true. In English, even when comments are made in the question format, they still carry enough force to make readers wonder or question the facts implied by the questions. Even when the defendant said he only asked questions, damage was done to my company. 
zh-TW	這不對。這在英文裡面，即使是用問題的形式，它也是有強力的作用去質疑事實。也就是說，當被告問了這些問題的時候，他對我們的公司就造成了毁謗、造成我們的名譽受損。

zh-TW	你的意思是說，不管對方是否用問題方式提出質疑，你們公司的名譽實際上都有所損害嗎？請解釋一下。
en-US	Can you make a further explanation that no matter the defendant used the question or not, your company...the reputation of your company is still damaged?

en-US	Yes, when the defendant asked those questions, it caused doubt and suspicion in the circle of foreigners in Taiwan. Foreigners form their own circle here in Taiwan and rumors travel fast. That’s why even the Labor Bureau paid several visits to our company, trying to find out if we were involved in the matters posted on Foreign Land.
zh-TW	沒錯，被告的確造成了一些質疑。公司的確受到損害了，因為這些謠言都已經傳遍了。台灣的勞工局也有來造訪我們，去試圖找出我們是否牽涉其中。

zh-TW	那勞工局前往貴公司瞭解外國人的雇用狀況，以及居留證的申請細節，有發現什麼不符合的地方嗎？
en-US	So when Labor Bureau went to visit your company and asked you about the your hiring and applying for ARC, are there any violations of your rule?

en-US	No, the representatives from the Bureau came but did not find anything wrong with our company or our hiring practice. 
zh-TW	沒有，他們有過來探視但沒有發現任何問題，在申請上面都沒有問題。

zh-TW	如果勞工局的調查並沒有發現什麼不妥之處，或是違法之處，再加上剛剛被告也解釋，他撰寫這些文章的目的都只是希望貴公司能夠進行自清的動作，有沒有可能雙方進行和解呢？
en-US	If the Labor Bureau did not find anything wrong in your company. Furthermore, the aim of the defendant’s asking your question is to want to get your self-clarification; as a result, is there any chance for you to make a settlement?

en-US	We previously tried but failed to reach any conclusion. I would only consider settling this case with two things from the defendant. First, he has to formally apologize to Winwin for posting those inappropriate comments on Foreign Land. Second, as he said he heard all those details from “other foreign friends,” he should provide the names of those people to clear his own name.
zh-TW	我們之前有試過，但最後都沒有達到任何共識。我只對這個被告要求兩件事。第一件事情，我只希望他能公開道歉，說明他對外國園地的毀謗。第二，就像他說的，他是從其他人那邊聽到這些消息細節的，他應該要提供到底確切是從哪些人聽到的。

zh-TW	被告，就像剛剛告訴人所指出，如果要進行和解，他希望由你這邊採取兩個行動，第一，正式道歉，對於在外國園地所發表的文章，不論你的文章是否造成告訴人公司實質上的名譽受損，對方都希望你提出道歉。第二，你剛剛前面指出，你是從一些外國友人那邊，聽到告訴人公司有違法對待外國勞工之嫌，你可以提供這些友人的姓名嗎？
en-US	Defendant, as the accuser required, if you want to reach a settlement, you have to take the following two actions...the above mentioned two actions. First, you have to apologize formally. Regarding your posts on the Foreign Land, no matter you had caused damage to their reputation... As you mentioned before, you have heard these rumors from your foreign friends, and could you please provide those friends’ names, since you are suspected of violating defamation.

en-US	No, I would not consider these terms. First of all, I don’t know why I should apologize for posting some questions on the Internet. Since when is asking questions a crime? Second, Winwin cannot agree to settle the case with the term of obtaining names from me. This is not right.
zh-TW	不，我不會考慮以上兩個方式。首先，我還是不懂為什麼我只是問一些問題就要受到處罰。從什麼時候開始問問題變成一種罪？第二，雙贏公司並不同意要和解，若是我提供這些人的姓名。

zh-TW	如果被告堅持因為文章的書寫內容都是以問題的方式進行，並沒有要毀謗告訴人公司的意圖，這顯然在第一個部分，你就是拒絕道歉，是嗎？
en-US	The defendant you insist that you are writing these posts in the form of asking questions, so you refuse to apologize, right?

en-US	No, I will not consider making an apology.
zh-TW	不，我並不考慮要道歉。

zh-TW	對於告訴人的第二個要求，你也拒絕。是因為擔心告訴人公司會對那些人進行相關的法律訴訟，是嗎？
en-US	As for the second request of the accuser, do you worry that your foreign friends will be filed a lawsuit against?

en-US	The thing is that some of the friends used to or may be currently working for Winwin. How could I jeopardize them just for the sake of settling my own case? Why should they suffer the potential harm? 
zh-TW	重點是，有些友人是曾經或是現在正在雙贏工作的。我怎麼忍心讓他們暴露在危險當中，只是為了要和解？為什麼他們要暴露在這些潛在的危險當中？

zh-TW	如果雙方無法就和解進行任何退讓，那麼法院這邊只能將這一次的準備程序內容進行彙整，以便進行下一次的審理程序。雙方的辯護人，是不是能夠針對和解這個選擇，再跟你們的當事人談一談呢？
en-US	The accuser if you don’t want to make any compromise against this settlement, we will gathering this information together to be the next court’s evidence. Today, the accuser and the defendant both have their lawyer. Regarding settlement, can both the lawyer talk to your client?

zh-TW	報告庭上，其實之前我們就有跟被告溝通，既然他說他的消息都是聽自其他友人，他大可以直接把那些人的名字提供給我們，而讓這一次的訴訟事件告一段落，但被告的態度一直很不合作，所以我們這邊也就無法進行進一步的和解動作。
en-US	Your Honor, I am the lawyer of the accuser. Your Honor, actually we have talked to the defendant before. Since the defendant obtained those details from his friends, Therefore, he can provide us the names of his friends and let the court to come to an end. However, the defendant is unwilling to cooperate with us, so the settlement cannot be made.

zh-TW	報告鈞院，其實我的當事人會有這樣的顧慮，最主要是因為告訴人公司雇用很多外國人士，我的當事人不希望因為提供友人姓名一事，而讓過去或目前為告訴人公司服務的外國人士，惹上不必要的麻煩。望請鈞院了解。
en-US	Your Honor, I’m the lawyer of the defendant. Actually, the concerns... the main concerns of my client is that your company has hired many of his friends. My client doesn’t hope to provide those names since those friends are...used to work in your company or currently work in your company, so he doesn’t want them to get into trouble. Your Honor, hope you can understand.

zh-TW	既然告訴人跟被告雙方對於和解都各自有堅持，本庭定中華民國109年8月14日上午11點整進行審理程序。
en-US	Since that both parties are hold their own insistence, so we will set the next court, the trial procedure on at 11 AM on August 14, 2020.

zh-TW	 請問被告，有無需要法院進一步調查之證據？
en-US	The dependent, do you need any further investigation, the court can help you.

en-US	No, your honor.
zh-TW	不，沒有。

zh-TW	那告訴人這邊呢？
en-US	How about the accuser, do you want the court to help you investigate any evidence?

en-US	I will think about it. If anything comes up, I will ask my lawyer to place a request to the court.
zh-TW	讓我們再思考一下，如果需要的話我會請我的律師再跟庭上詢問。

zh-TW	那針對下一次的庭期，我們就不再發傳票，而是直接在庭直接以橘色小卡進行通知。請在簽完今天的筆錄後，領取小卡，再行離開。
en-US	About the next court, we will not send you any subpoena. Instead, we will send you the orange card for you. After you take your statement, you can get the orange card and go. So the procedure ends here.

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	You have the right to maintain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	2.你有權雇用法定辯護人，若你為低收入戶、中低收入戶、原住民或其他符合法律規定者，得請求法律服務。

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	Yes, I do.
zh-TW	是的，我了解

zh-TW	請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please….

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	As the indictment.

zh-TW	被告，你被檢察官起訴在民國109年3月8日於新北市樹林區學府路與大學路交叉口、7-11門口前，盜取他人摩托車一輛，車牌號碼為BL-1234，經由摩托車持有人報案後，警方於柑園路一段25號附近尋獲。經警方調閱7-11門口監視器，確認摩托車為你所竊，有何辯解？
en-US	The defendant, you are prosecuted by the prosecutor that on March 8th 2020, on the door of a 7-11 at the intersection of Xuefu Rd and Daxue Rd you stole a motorcycle which had the plate number BL-1234. After the owner of the motorcycle reported the case to the police, the police found the motorcycle around Ganyuan Rd, Sec 1. After the police checked the CCTV clip…

en-US	 I did not steal the motorcycle. On that day, it was rainy very hard. My friend and I did not bring an umbrella and we were in a hurry to get home. So, we decided to borrow the motorcycle. Our plan was to give it back, you know, we planned to put the motorbike back to the original place the second day. We didn’t mean to steal it at all.
zh-TW	我沒有偷那輛摩托車，那天，雨下得很大，我和我的朋友沒有帶傘，但是我們急著回家，所以我們決定「借用」一下那輛摩托車，我們有打算要還回去，真的，我們想說隔天把摩托車放回原來的地方，我們真的沒有要偷的意思。

zh-TW	沒有帶傘就可以偷人家車子嗎？
en-US	Can you stole the motorcycle when you did not bring an umbrella? 

en-US	No, but I was in a hurry to go home that day. My plane was leaving on the second day to go back to my country. I am really sorry. That was a terrible mistake.
zh-TW	不行，但那天下大雨而且我趕著回家，我回國的飛機在明天就會到達，我知道我犯了大錯，感到非常抱歉。

zh-TW	為什麼會偷那部車子呢？我的意思是為什麼是那部，而不是別部車呢
en-US	Why did you steal that car instead of other cars?

en-US	At that time, I just came out from the convenience store. It was raining and I saw that motorcycle. I realized the owner must have forgotten to take out the key. I thought I could use it briefly and bring it back soon.
zh-TW	那時，我剛從便利商店出來，我看到了那輛摩托車，發現車主應該是忘記拿走他的車鑰匙了，我想我可以稍微借用一下，再很快的還回來。

zh-TW	你的意思是那個摩托車的主人，忘了把鑰匙拿走嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the owner of the motorcycle forgot to remove the key?

en-US	Yes, the key was left in the ignition, so I just rode the motorbike away.
zh-TW	是的，鑰匙還留在鑰匙孔裡，所以我就把它騎走了。

zh-TW	那你剛剛說，原來的計畫是要把車子還回去，那你有這樣做嗎？
en-US	You said that you planned to give the motorcycle back, so at last, did you do so?

en-US	After we rode the bike away, I first gave my friend a ride home. Then I went back to my apartment. I was very tired and went to bed directly. I was thinking to return the motorbike the next day. But, on the second day, my plane was leaving so I totally forgot about this plan. 
zh-TW	我們騎走摩托車後，我先把我的朋友載回他家，然後我再回去我的公寓，那時我已經很累，所以我就直接去睡覺，隔天我就想要把它還回去了，但是，我隔天忙著要處理回國的事，所以我就完全忘記這件事了。

zh-TW	那為什麼車子後來會跑到柑園路去了呢？
en-US	How did the motorcycle end up in Ganyuan Rd?

en-US	I don’t know. I talked to my landlord. He told me that he didn’t know whose motorbike that was. He didn’t feel comfortable about having it parked in front of our apartment building. Maybe the motorbike was moved there.
zh-TW	我不知道，我有跟我的房東說這件事，他跟我說他不知道那是誰的摩托車，他覺得放在大樓前面不妥，也許摩托車是被移去那裡了。

zh-TW	你知道後來摩托車主人報警了吧？在我們的法律上，竊盜罪是告訴乃論，也就是說，如果摩托車的主人願意不告你的話，那這個案子就可以撤掉，那你後來有跟對方有任何的溝通嗎？
en-US	You know that the owner of the motorcycle call for the police, right? In our country, the theft is a criminal brought to the court only when a lawsuit is filed. Which means that if the owner file a suit for you, this case can be removed. Then, did you try to communicate with the accuser?

en-US	Yes, when I returned to Taiwan after that trip, the police told me about this case. I met with the motorbike owner. I said sorry to him and agreed to offer him some money.
zh-TW	null

zh-TW	那調解的過程怎麼樣，對方願意接受你的道歉嗎？
en-US	How did the mediation go? Does the other party accept your apology?

en-US	We reached an agreement at the amount of NT$6,000. The owner accepted my apology. He brought the motorbike to the shop to have a check. The bike was not damaged and just needed a small tune-up.
zh-TW	我們用6000元達成和解，車主接受了我的道歉，他把他的機車帶到機車行檢查，摩托車沒有甚麼大問題，只要小小維修一下。

zh-TW	雙方有達成和解金的數字嗎？
en-US	Did both party have a consensus on settlement amount?

en-US	Yes, NT$6,000 and I gave the money to the owner already.
zh-TW	是的，我會賠償他6000元，然後我已經把錢給他了。

zh-TW	那你們什麼時候要簽和解書呢，還是已經簽了呢？
en-US	When will you sign up the settlement letter, or have you already signed up?

en-US	We signed the settlement letter.
zh-TW	我們已經簽好和解書了。

zh-TW	那今天有帶來嗎？
en-US	Did you bring it with you today?

en-US	I have the copy at home but I can bring it next time.
zh-TW	我的那一份在家裡，我可以下次帶來。

zh-TW	我們今天的程序是準備程序，會訂下一次的庭期，請你把和解書正本帶過來，那你還有沒有什麼要請法庭幫你調查的證據呢？那天跟你在一起的朋友，你希望法庭傳喚他做證人嗎？我的意思是，你需不需要他來幫忙你說明這個案情？
en-US	Today is the preparation procedure. We will set the date of the next proceeding. Please bring the original copy of the settlement letter with you the next time. Then, is there anything you want the court to investigate for you? Do you want the court to call the friend with you that day? I mean did you need him to decribe the situation?

en-US	My friend is in Taiwan now. Maybe he can help explain what happened that day. He knew that I planned to return the motorbike. I really meant it.
zh-TW	我的朋友現在在臺灣，也許他可以幫我解釋那天發生了甚麼事，他知道我會把機車還回去，我真的不是故意的。

zh-TW	那這樣子，我們下一次開庭的時候，會請你的朋友，也就是Mark Alison到庭，說明當天的情況，也會請摩托車所有人，也就是當事人到庭，說明和解的細由。
en-US	Then, in the next court, we will ask your friend, Mark Alison to the court to describe the details. We will also call for the motorcycle owner, also the accused to the court. 

zh-TW	檢察官有無意見？
en-US	Is there any problem?

zh-TW	沒有意見。
en-US	No, I don’t have any question.

zh-TW	檢察官這邊有沒有需要再調查的證據？
en-US	Is there any…?

zh-TW	沒有。
en-US	No

zh-TW	本案訂中華民國109年8月3日早上9點30分進行審理程序，會再寄傳票通知涉案人，請務必到庭，如果被告覺得需要辯護人的協助，可選任辯護人或申請公共辯護人。今天程序到此為止
en-US	The date of the trial procedure will be at 9:30 am, August 3rd 2020. The court will send subpoenas to the involved parties. Please make sure you are pleasant in the court. If the defendant needs the assistance of the lawyer, the defendant can hire a lawyer or apply for a pro bono lawyer. If there is no further questions, the court is dismissed.

zh-TW	請檢察官陳述犯罪要旨。
en-US	The prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	As stated in the indictment.

zh-TW	被告，你被檢察官起訴在民國109年3月8日於新北市樹林區學府路與大學路交叉口、7-11門口前，盜取他人摩托車一輛，車牌號碼為BL-1234，經由摩托車持有人報案後，警方於柑園路一段25號附近尋獲。經警方調閱7-11門口監視器，確認摩托車為你所竊，有何辯解？
en-US	This incident happened on March 8, 2020. The location was in front of the 711 at the intersection of the 學府road and 大學road in 樹林district, New Taipei City. You stole the motorcycle. The plate number is BL-1234. After the owner of motorcycle reported the case, the police found the motorcycle around柑園road section one. After the police saw the CCTV clips in front of the 711, …

en-US	 I did not steal the motorcycle. On that day, it was rainy very hard. My friend and I did not bring an umbrella and we were in a hurry to get home. So, we decided to borrow the motorcycle. Our plan was to give it back, you know, we planned to put the motorbike back to the original place the second day. We didn’t mean to steal it at all.
zh-TW	我沒有罪，我沒有偷摩托車。那天雨下得很大，我和我的朋友沒有帶雨傘，所以我們趕快回家，所以我們決定借摩托車，我們原本就計畫好在第二天還回去，我們不是故意要偷的。

zh-TW	沒有帶傘就可以偷人家車子嗎？
en-US	You didn’t bring your umbrella, so you stole the motorcycle?

en-US	No, but I was in a hurry to go home that day. My plane was leaving on the second day to go back to my country. I am really sorry. That was a terrible mistake.
zh-TW	沒有，我只是想要趕快回家。我要搭隔天的飛機回我的國家。我很抱歉犯了這麼大的錯誤。

zh-TW	為什麼會偷那部車子呢？我的意思是為什麼是那部，而不是別部車呢
en-US	So why did you steal that car? I mean that why did you steal that car but not other car?

en-US	At that time, I just came out from the convenience store. It was raining and I saw that motorcycle. I realized the owner must have forgotten to take out the key. I thought I could use it briefly and bring it back soon.
zh-TW	那時候我正剛走出便利商店，那時下著雨，我看到了一台摩托車，我發現車主忘記拔鑰匙了，我覺得我可以很快用它然後再還回去。

zh-TW	你的意思是那個摩托車的主人，忘了把鑰匙拿走嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the owner of the motorcycle left the key in the ignition?

en-US	Yes, the key was left in the ignition, so I just rode the motorbike away.
zh-TW	對，他的車鑰匙忘記拔了，所以我就騎走了。

zh-TW	那你剛剛說，原來的計畫是要把車子還回去，那你有這樣做嗎？
en-US	You said you would turn the motorcycle back as planned, did you do that?

en-US	After we rode the bike away, I first gave my friend a ride home. Then I went back to my apartment. I was very tired and went to bed directly. I was thinking to return the motorbike the next day. But, on the second day, my plane was leaving so I totally forgot about this plan. 
zh-TW	在我騎走摩托車後，我先載我朋友回家，然後再回去我的公寓。那時，我很累所以就直接睡覺了。我原本預計隔天還回去。然而，隔天飛機起飛，所以就完全忘了這個計畫。

zh-TW	那為什麼車子後來會跑到柑園路去了呢？
en-US	Then, why the motorcycle was at Ganyuan road section 1?

en-US	I don’t know. I talked to my landlord. He told me that he didn’t know whose motorbike that was. He didn’t feel comfortable about having it parked in front of our apartment building. Maybe the motorbike was moved there.
zh-TW	我不知道為什麼，我有跟我的房東講這件事，他有跟我說他不知道那個摩托車是誰的，他覺得摩托車停在公寓前面是很不好的，所以可能摩托車就被移到那邊了。

zh-TW	你知道後來摩托車主人報警了吧？在我們的法律上，竊盜罪是告訴乃論，也就是說，如果摩托車的主人願意不告你的話，那這個案子就可以撤掉，那你後來有跟對方有任何的溝通嗎？
en-US	Did you know the owner of the motorcycle reported the case to the police, right? As our law, theft is a case that is substantiated when you file a lawsuit. That is, if the owner of the motorcycle doesn’t sue you, the case can be dropped. Did you try to communicate with the other party?

en-US	Yes, when I returned to Taiwan after that trip, the police told me about this case. I met with the motorbike owner. I said sorry to him and agreed to offer him some money.
zh-TW	是的，當我回來台灣的時候，警察有跟我講這個案件，我和車主聯繫，我向他道歉並且同意付他賠償金。

zh-TW	那調解的過程怎麼樣，對方願意接受你的道歉嗎？
en-US	So how was the process of mediation? Does the other party accept your apology?

en-US	We reached an agreement at the amount of NT$6,000. The owner accepted my apology. He brought the motorbike to the shop to have a check. The bike was not damaged and just needed a small tune-up.
zh-TW	我們達成協議，我付他6000元賠償金。他也接受我的道歉。他把車牽到維修廠檢查，摩托車沒有太大損壞，只需要小小維修。

zh-TW	雙方有達成和解金的數字嗎？
en-US	Did both parties decide the settlement amount?

en-US	Yes, NT$6,000 and I gave the money to the owner already.
zh-TW	是的，就如我剛剛所說，我已給他6000元的賠償金。

zh-TW	那你們什麼時候要簽和解書呢，還是已經簽了呢？
en-US	When will you sign the settlement contract? Or you have already settled this case?

en-US	We signed the settlement letter.
zh-TW	我們已經簽和解書了。

zh-TW	那今天有帶來嗎？
en-US	Do you bring that here?

en-US	I have the copy at home but I can bring it next time.
zh-TW	我家裡有一份，我下次可以帶來。

zh-TW	我們今天的程序是準備程序，會訂下一次的庭期，請你把和解書正本帶過來，那你還有沒有什麼要請法庭幫你調查的證據呢？那天跟你在一起的朋友，你希望法庭傳喚他做證人嗎？我的意思是，你需不需要他來幫忙你說明這個案情？
en-US	Today is the preparatory procedure. We will set the date next time and please bring the settlement here next time. Is there any evidence you want the court to investigate? Do you want your friend who was with you to be subpoenaed to the court? I mean, do you want your friend to help you describe the details of the case?

en-US	My friend is in Taiwan now. Maybe he can help explain what happened that day. He knew that I planned to return the motorbike. I really meant it.
zh-TW	我的朋友已經回台灣了，也許他能幫我解釋案發狀況，他知道我原本就預計要還摩托車。

zh-TW	那這樣子，我們下一次開庭的時候，會請你的朋友，也就是Mark Alison到庭，說明當天的情況，也會請摩托車所有人，也就是當事人到庭，說明和解的細由。
en-US	Ok, so we’ll subpoena your friend, Mark Alison, to the next court to describe the details of the case. We’ll also ask the owner of the motorcycle to the court to describe the settlement details. 

zh-TW	檢察官有無意見？
en-US	Do you have any further questions?

zh-TW	沒有意見。
en-US	No. 

zh-TW	檢察官這邊有沒有需要再調查的證據？
en-US	The prosecutor, is there any evidence to be investigated?

zh-TW	沒有。
en-US	No, I rest.

zh-TW	本案訂中華民國109年8月3日早上9點30分進行審理程序，會再寄傳票通知涉案人，請務必到庭，如果被告覺得需要辯護人的協助，可選任辯護人或申請公共辯護人。今天程序到此為止

zh-TW	是的，我了解了。

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	First, please, the prosecutor states the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today, we are here for the preparatory procedure of the adultery case. The plaintiff…the plaintiff…the plaintiff wanted to file the case against his… her husband for… for the suspect that he is having an affair with his coworkers. Because she has found some intimate messages in her husband’s cellphones, and, sometimes, her husband would make up reasons for extra hours for the… his work. Also, he would have tele-conference with his coworkers, so the plaintiff is suspect that her husband has a relationship with his coworker beyond coworker’s relationship. The defendant, your wife sue you with the adultery case, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然無罪。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s procedure, first, we are going to examine the text messages between the defendant and his coworker, and we will…we will decided whether this message would constitute adultery case. Does the plaintiff…Do the plaintiff and the defendant fully understand today’s procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我明白。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, I want to ask the plaintiff, how long have you been married? Do you guys have kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have been married for 4 years, and we didn’t.. and we don’t have kids.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	So…did you and your husband get married in Taiwan, or you get married in foreign country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	My husband and I met in Taiwan. 4 years ago, he was here to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	Then, during the past few years, is his job in Taiwan teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a teacher to teach Portuguese. Then, after we get married, he still teaching Portuguese. However, in Taiwan, Portuguese is not a popular language to learn from, so, sometimes, he didn’t have a… his teaching hour is not stable or regular, and sometimes, there are a period between jobs that is as long as a month or even two month. Then , in order to have a steady and stable incomes, he decided to teach English. However, his mother tongue is not English, so he decided to seek an advanced degree on English.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned that he decided to seek an advanced degree. It means that he seek an advanced degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wanted to teach English, so the degree of his seeking has to be about English teaching. He found an Internet courses about distance learning program in the University of California, and this course is that he doesn’t have to go to America to learn, but he can have a distance learning in Taiwan about English teaching. So after he finishes all the credits of the internet courses, then he can get a master degree. Therefore, he can use this American advanced degree to English teaching job in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then... What is his relationship with the person he had affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are the coworkers in the cram school. And in the cram school, they have a program that a Chinese teacher would partner up with an foreign teacher, so the woman is his partner.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know that they are having an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At the beginning, I found out that he started to work over hours, so I confronted with him that why he has to spend so much time in a English cram school. And he told me that he have to communicate with the Chinese teacher, so he has to spend the extra hours. So I told him that it just a cram school, why should he spend another hours. At first, I didn’t doubt him. Then I found out that he would answer some calls. And when he answer that phone, he didn’t talk in front of me. He went to the study room to have the phone call. And then I examine his phone, the texts he got, then I found out that there are something wrong.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So… in his phone, did you find anything unusual?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	First, I look up his phone book. Then I found out that there is a same number that calls over and over. And then I found out that the texts he got are all from the same person, the same woman. Then I realize that he and that woman text every single day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even though they are texting, it is alright. It is not a big deal. The context is fine. It’s not horrible, right?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it was a very normal and regular text, it would be fine. But he is a married man, and in the texts, there are some intimate message, and those message I have already filed to the court as the evidence.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	As you can see the exhibit 1, there was the context of the message, and I would like to ask the defendant, are those messages from your cellphone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這是我手機裡的訊息。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	If that’s so, I would like to ask you some questions about these message. The first, I would like to ask the text from the cellphone number 0958932123 on December 21st, 2018. The time was 9:50 p.m. And in the context, it was written, “I really miss you my love.” What did it mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那個簡訊是從我的同事那傳給我的，那時候我請了兩天假，然後他就覺得有點小擔心，然後傳簡訊來關心我一下而已。我的同事是在美國受的教育，所以他才會這麼的開放，那這些說話方式也只是她表達他自己的一些說法，那剛剛提到的那個my love，也就只是我們稱我們關心的人的親暱的名字。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So what you mean is that, the person was educated in the west, so her mind is westernized. And therefore, the way she express her emotion and feelings are more open? And so…the phrase “my love” is not a big deal and didn’t mean anything.

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	是的，那只是我們在比較親密的朋友之間會稱呼彼此的方式而已。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	How about the first part of the message?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我剛剛說的阿，他就只是擔心我而已，因為那時候…我們兩個是工作上的搭檔。所以在我請兩天假的時候，他就是非常的擔心我。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So what you mean is that the person…when you are away, she needs your assistance during the teaching, so she sent you the message to express her worries and concerns,. Is that what you mean?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的，那就是這簡訊的意義，所以這封簡訊根本就沒有什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Then, we will examine the second message. It was sent by the same cellphone. And the time was on December 29th, 2017 at 11:55 p.m. It was written, “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What does this text mean? Could you explain?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他寫這個訊息就只是想要問我說，在我的中文文本中要怎麼翻成英文。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you mean is that she sent you the message in order to help you to accomplish your homework? What does it even mean? 

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我太太剛剛在前面的時候跟法庭告知的，我現在在上一堂就是碩士的課程，那這整個課程有三十個學分，那為了要完成這三十個學分，裡面難免會有些作業跟一些練習，那我當然要完成這些東西。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Could you first explain what did you major in for your master degree?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的主修是在英語教學，那在其中的一些課程安排上，就是有些英語教學的課程沒錯，那來有另一個部分是關於文化以及語言能力的一些課程，那就當然其中有一些...這些東西。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that the field you choose is TESOL, there are some culture and language communication in the course?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我印象中是起碼有三堂課跟文化語言溝通有關的課。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what is the assignment which is related to the cultural and language communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這堂課程的作業在每個學生身上都不太一樣。那以我為例的話，因為我現在在台灣，然後想要取得英文教學的工作，那為了要達成這個目標，那勢必我是一定要有能力去掌握中文。所以我有很多的作業是要怎麼中翻英或是英翻中。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	Therefore, in order to fulfill the plan that you want to teach English in Taiwan, so you have to finish and complete the assignment or translate English into Chinese, or Chinese into English?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，而同時間我也被耀球說我要精進我的口說及寫作的能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Okay, then we will go back to the texts we have been presenting, so the text was your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，那就是我的作業，那在當時的時候，我拿到句子的時候，我完全不知道要怎麼翻，你也知道，就是中文有些詞彙就是很難翻譯成英文，所以在當時我拿到作業時，我完全不知道該怎麼翻譯，所以我就是向我的同事求助，那我就請他在翻完之後，將翻譯傳簡訊給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Well, according by your claim, that this text message was only the question of your assignment. And the college is only translate the assignment for you and give you the answer. Is that what you claim?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	對，那個內容只是我功課的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Okay, now the defendant please read the exhibit 1, page 14 to page 16, are all these messages the answers of your assignment for your master degree?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些簡訊內容都只是為了要完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Well… what’s your explanation about your wife suspect that you are having an affair with your coworker. What’s your explanation?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太真的是在這件事情上想太多了，我一直知道他一直很不滿意我養家活口的能力，而在我一開始要在去進修，取得碩士學位的時候後，他就完全沒有表現出支持我的舉動或是…沒有任何支持。因為她一直沒有就是表現出任何支持，所以我就沒有想要去問他，或是請他幫我完成這些作業，而我就覺得說，他就是這整個誤解的罪魁禍首。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your explanation, it seems that there are some unhappiness between you and your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在一開始新婚的時候，我們的確過得很愉快，但是就是主要問題就是我的工作，因為在我一開始在這裡教授葡萄牙文，但是一直碰壁又碰到困難，就變成了我們主要的問題。所以就，我的工作就變成我們吵架的問題，我們就時常為了這種問題吵架，然後這整個狀況，造成我非常的沮喪、非常的洩氣、非常的挫折。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, then we’ll go back to your master degree. When did you start your master degree? Do you finish it? And when will you get your diplomat?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2015年的秋天註冊的，就開始這個課程那他預計是兩年的課程，那我應該會是在2017年的五月的時候畢業，但是我一直沒有完成這個學位是因為我一直都有一些兼職工作，所以我就沒有時間去完成我的那些作業。就像我剛剛提到的，就我太太一直都沒有很支持我的這個決定，所以在整個求學過程中我一直覺得很沮喪，而且很累，所以我就還沒有拿到這個學位。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	So you just mentioned that this program is designed for 2 years, and you didn’t finish it, so what is the main reason of that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有的課程作業，還有一些課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So when is the last semester you register?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我最後一個學期是在2017年的春天註冊的。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	So if it is true, as you just mentioned, that the course has already finish in May, 2017. So it is reasonable that after the course you didn’t have any assignment. But after the semester has ended, during the 7 months you have the text message with your coworker, what’s the purpose.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	就算我沒有完成我的學位，也不代表說我就不要再精進我的語言能力，所以在這個課程結束後，我就還是做一些作業、一些練習，就是我是自學啦，自修這樣子。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that despite you didn’t finish the course, you still want to improve your language competence, so you continue to write this text? 

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，這就是為什麼我會向我的同事求救。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So this coworker you have, she is like tutor, Chinese tutor, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	他不是我的家教而已，他更是一個很好很好的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	So… do you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我原本說要付錢給她，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you didn’t pay her, why she answers your texts in the middle of the night? Doesn’t it exceed the relationship of being a coworker?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	就是為什麼我會說他是個非常好的朋友，因為他是利用他自己的時間在教我中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still work in the cram school as a English teacher?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的，我還在那邊工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does the coworker still worker there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是的，他還在那邊工作，但我們現在已經不是搭檔了。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any other witness or other evidence that you wanted to provided to the court or the person you want to subpoena further?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I would like the court to subpoena the coworker, Rong-er Huang as witness to clarify the evidence of the texts and to clarify and explain the relationship of the defendant and her.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The plaintiff, do you have any other evidence you want the court to investigate for you?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I have heard that the cram school trying to fix the relationship with my husband and the coworker, and they’re trying to convince the coworker to leave, to quit the job. So I wanted the court to ask the cram school for further statement or subpoena them as witness.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any other evidence the you want the court to investigate for you. Now the situation is that, because your degree program have already finished in May, 2017, so it cannot be the evidence or explanation for your relationship with your coworker. And most of your message is sent at 9 p.m. Therefore, it is a very suspicious movement or relationship between you and your coworker. Therefore, do you have any other evidence that you can prove that you and your coworker are only the relationship of college or friend to clarify that. Do you have any other evidence to clarify that?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我目前想步道法院可以幫我調查的證據，就像我所說的，我跟我同事之間的關係非常的單純，我們倆之間的訊息就只是為了要增進我的語言能力以及我的中文能力而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court date is set on June 24th, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. as the inquiry of witness, and during the procedure, we will ask both party, the plaintiff and the defendant to explain the situation. If it is necessary, both party can have the layer to attend the court.

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白。

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory procedure, and the case is prosecuted by the accuser Yu Han Wang. The incident is caused from the accuser’s husband Edward Papayashi. The defendant, Edward Papayashi… so her husband is prosecuted with a crime of adultery case and her husband Edward Papayashi had sent an intimate message with her co-worker and they had too close reaction. And they often work overtime, and in the late night they had tele-conferencing. And it seems that this relationship is beyond co-worker’s relationship. The defendant, your wife Yu Han Wang think that you have an affair with your co-worker, and you are prosecuted with a crime of adultery. What’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, the judge will mainly ask the defendant and to understand the details and the relationship between the defendant and his co-worker to clarify whether the defendant and his co-worker have affairs and constitute adultery case. Do the both party understand the procedure today?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Yes, I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是的，我了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	the accuser, first I want to ask you, how long have you and your husband been married, and do you have children with your husband?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	Oh, we have been married for four years, and we don’t have children.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Well, so you too got married in Taiwan or in foreign countries?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	My husband and I met in Taiwan, and four years ago, my husband just came to Taiwan, and he wanted to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the past years, has he taught Portuguese in Taiwan for four years?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he taught Portuguese. And after we got married, he continued teaching Portuguese. However, you know that Portuguese in Taiwan is not a popular language, and it’s not common, so the teaching hours is not stable, and sometimes will even have a period between jobs. And sometimes, the period between jobs could last for one to two months. And because my husband wants to have a stable income, so he wanted to …tended to teach English. And however, his mother tongue is not English, so he sought an advanced degree and want to polish his English.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned your husband wanted to polish his English, and does it mean that he wanted to seek an advanced degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wants to teach English in Taiwan, so he wanted to seek an advanced degree which is about TESOL. So my husband have a distance learning program, which is provided by… which is taught from California, America, and had a distance learning program. And he only has to learn on distance learning and do not have to come to America. In this way, after all the credits he got from the distance learning program, he can get a master degree and after gets a master degree, he can be an English teacher and teachs English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then what’s the relationship between your husband and the person he has an affair with in this adultery case?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	My husband and the person he has an affair with is his colleague. Because the distance learning program have an arrangement of both… Chinese and foreign teacher. And in the distance learning program, they are colleague and have to partner with each other.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have affairs and beyond co-worker’s relationship?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	at first, I noticed the strange thing it is because my husband started to work overtime in school and I just wonder my husband just go to learn English and want to seek an advanced degree, and why do you have to work overtime? And he said it is because he had a Chinese teacher, and he had to partner with her, so he has to work in school and communicate with her, so they can learn better. In the beginning, I didn’t suspect he would do the adultery. I started to think strange and it was because after he came back from school, he started to have many different calls, and the more important is that he wouldn’t talk in front of me. Instead, he would go to the study and talked. And because I think it’s strange, so I checked her cellphone and found many messages.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	so, did you find any unusual messages in his cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	In my husband’s phone book, there is always the same phone number, so I found it stranger and I checked his message. I found he always has messages with the same woman every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	And even though he always has text message with the same woman, does it… why would you think it’s strange? It seems fine. Or did you see any strange message in her cellphone? 

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If the message is just some common words, and I won’t find something strange, and will prosecute adultery case. and it is because the message is very intimate, and just before today’s proceeding, I had provided some of the messages to the judge, and I think all the contents are in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Exhibit evidence1 and page 13: here is the message content that your wife provided to the court, and the defendant you can check whether the message content is true.

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這些是在我手機裡面的簡訊內容。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	well, so I will ask you some details in these messages. And the first message, the time is on December 21st, 2018. And the time is at 9:50 pm. The phone number is 0958932123. This phone number sent a message to your cellphone, and the contents of the message is 我非常想你. So what’s your plea? What’s your reaction to this intimate message?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那是我一個同事傳給我的訊息，那當時我放了兩天假，因為我的同事很擔心，所以他傳了這封訊息給我。我的同事是在美國長大的，所以她是非常心胸寬大的，他講話一直都是這麼直接這樣子如此，那我們兩個在稱呼彼此親近的人的時候，會直接稱我的寶貝、我的愛。我們一直都是用這樣的說詞，所以我並不覺得有任何的不妥。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	so what you mean is that the people who sent the message…because she has stayed in the foreign countries for several years, so her thought is westernized, and she is kind of open-minded. So even she said my love to you don’t have any other special meanings? 

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	哦對啊，這並沒有任何的意義，這只是我們對於親近的朋友，關心的說詞而已，表達我們是好朋友、彼此關心的意思。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	So what about the previous message she just sent to you? I really missed you, this sentence.

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	正如同我剛剛所說過的，那是因為她擔心我，我們彼此是夥伴關係，那當時我請了兩天假，她自然而來會關心我，所以才發了這則訊息給我、表達他的關心。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Well, so you mean that it is just because you had two days off, and do not go to work, and because she is your partner in the distance learning program, without you she has no assistance, so she sent this message to you, it’s that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的，所以這個訊息就是這樣子來的，這並沒有什麼了不起、很特別或是很奇怪的事情。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	Let’s move to the exhibit evidence two. The message happened at 11:55pm, on December 29th on 2017. And the message is also sent from the same phone number, and the content is 我想要在你身旁，我們什麼時候才可以再一起呢？ So I want to by your side, and when we can truly be together? So what does it mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	當時她是想學著如何用中文來表達意思，所以她傳了這封訊息給我？

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	so you mean that she, your colleague, sent this message to you, and the purpose is to help you do the homework. So what does it mean, I don’t really know…I don’t really get you.

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	當我老婆有起訴我們通姦這件事的時候，我正在修遠距課程，並想要得到碩士學位，在這個課程當中，我需要修30學分。那自然地，為了完成這30個學分，我必須完成一些作業跟練習，那我的夥伴就協助我完成這些作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	I want to ask…so what do you really study in your master program? I don’t understand, can you explain to me?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是關於英語教學。那裡面就有關於英語教學、以及文化相關以及語言能力的培訓。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So what you mean is that the TESOL that you studied in your master program, and in the master program, it contains some of courses about culture and communication, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，然後我記得在這個碩士學位當中，有三堂課是關於文化以及溝通的課程。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So the courses about culture and communication, what’s the common assignment that the teacher will assign you? 

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	在這些文化課程當中，每個人的作業都會依照每個人在讀這個碩士學位的目的而有改變。那像我呢，我在讀這個碩士學位，是想要得到之後能在台灣教英文，因此我必須要展現我對中文有優秀的掌握能力。也是因為這樣，所以我的作業很多都是關於中文跟英文句子的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So you mean that because you plan to teach English in Taiwan, and you have to show that you has a good command of Chinese, so in order to complete your assignment, you have to translate the English sentence into Chinese, is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，此外我還需要去磨練我的口說以及寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So, let’s move back to the exhibit evidence two, the message. Do you mean that this message is one of your assignments?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，這就是我當時的作業，我記得當初我看到這句話中文的時候，其實我並不了解它的意思，畢竟中文很多用字對外國人來說是很難了解的，因為我不懂，所以我去找我的partner幫忙，請他幫忙把這句話翻成英文，再把答案傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Well, so that sentence, I want to by your side, kind of this sentence, is the situation just you wanted her to translate the Chinese sentence, and at that time, you asked her to send the correct answer to you. So it’s the total situation at that time?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	是的，那句話就只是我作業的解答而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	The defendant, let’s move to the exhibit evidence one, page 14 to16. Please… so now you can browse all the messages in this evidence, so you mean that all the messages are part of your assignments?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	沒錯，這些訊息都是為了完成作業，才有這些訊息。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	and your wife just said that you and your colleague have the adultery, and what do you want to explain?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	關於外遇這件事，我覺得一直以來都是我老婆想太多。我知道我在這個家庭中，我其實沒辦法支撐家庭的很多重擔，不過在這個課程當中，我的太太就也沒有…從我的課程開始到現在，我的妻子也沒有給我任何的協助。在我上碩士課程當中，我太太一直都不願意來協助我完成任何作業，要不是他這樣子不支持我，我也不需要請求我的中文夥伴來協助我，所以我覺得現在發生的一切，都不能怪到我頭上。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, it seems that you and your wife have something unhappy and do not get along well with your wife.

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	在我們剛結婚的時候，我們確實過得很幸福、也很開心，但是呢後來的問題就開始出現了，因為我在台灣教的是葡萄牙文，那工作的時數不穩定，也沒辦法帶來穩定的收入，所以我們就開始出現了狀況。在此之後，我們針對就業工作這件事情，我們時不時的在爭吵同件事，她並不相信我的努力跟堅持，我也不知道如何讓他了解我所面對的挫折跟困難之處。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Well, let’s move back to your master program. Until now, do you still study in the master program? And when will you get the degree?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2016年四月開始讀這個碩士學位，那照理來說這個課程需要兩年，那原則上我應該在2017年五月完成。因為我一直沒有穩定的工作，所以沒有足夠時間唸書，所以我後來就放棄這個學位。正如我剛剛所說的，在我讀碩士學位的過程中，我的太太完全沒有支持我，我在讀書過程完全都是靠我自己，過程中我覺得很疲累、很挫折，我不知道該怎麼辦。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	you just mentioned the degree program… the period is two years, and you don’t complete the program, and I want to know the reason that you failed the program.

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒辦法完成所有在課程上要求的作業，還有其中一些課程的要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	so in the last semester that you registered, and when did the semester end?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我在學註冊的最後一個學期，最後是在2017年春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	If all the things are just as you stated, the course should be end at May, 2017. And after you finished and stopped the program, you wouldn’t have any assignments. However, you still had text messages with your colleague after the course ends, and the period is for seven months, and what’s your explanation?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	雖然我沒辦法完成我的碩士學位，但不代表我不想要改善我的中文能力，因此在我結束這個課程之後，我就靠自己想要改善我的中摁能力。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean even though you didn’t finish the master program, you still wants to improve your Chinese, and wants your Chinese become influent, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，這就是為什麼我找我的女同事幫忙我。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	so, … your colleague kind of plays the role of your tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	對我來說，她所扮演的角色並不單單只是家教，更是我的好朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	And did you pay money to your colleague for her teaching?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我有說想付她錢，可是她沒有接受

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If she is not your tutor, and you do not pay her money, why did she work so hard, and at midnight, is the time that she go to bed, she still sent the messages to you. And the content of the message seems to beyond the co-worker’s relationship.

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這就是我為什麼說她真的是我很好的朋友，他都會在空閑時間幫助我，協助我精進中文能力

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Did you still teach English in the school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的我現在還在那邊工作

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	And this colleague is still work in the school now?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是的，她現在也在那個地方工作，不過我們現在不是同事關係，也沒有一起合作到。

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	rosecutor, do you need to subpoena anyone that can help you investigate the case or investigate any evidence?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena the defendant’s colleague, Rong Er Huang. And I want her to act as an witness and help the court to clarify all situations and all the background and the purposes of these messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, do you want the prosecutor investigate any evidence for you?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard the cram school they worked in,… I heard that the cram school just took some action, and they intended to persuade the colleague Huang Rong Er to quit the job. So I want to confirm with the cram school and clarify the situation.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you want the court to investigate for you any further evidence? The current situation is that you have finished your master program in May, 2017. There is no reason that you make up reasons for finishing the assignments and sent messages with your colleague Huang Rong Er. And especially the time you two sent messages is almost after 9pm, it’s very possible for people to think there is a strange relationship between you and do you have any evidence that can help you clarify all the situation in this case?

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我實在想不到任何可以就我的立場幫我調查的事情。就如同我剛才所說，我們傳訊息這件事情非常簡單，只是單純我想要增進我的中文能力，然後我想要把中文學習的更好。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next proceeding is set to held at 4:30pm on June 24th, in 2018. We will subpoena the witness, Huang Rong Er, and ask her. And the both party have the right to a lawyer. Do the both party understand all the procedure in this case?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	Now I am going to inform the defendant of his rights and obligations:

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	First, you have the right to remain silent. And do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights? 

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解。

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor please stat the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same by the file.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the…adultery case. The defendant wife accuse his husband Takayashi, for he find the intimate message in his husband’s cellphone. And his husband often find reasons for extra work, and moreover have the tele-conference with his co-workers, which is beyond the co-worker relationship. The defendant, your wife suspect you have an affair with other woman, what’s your plead?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然無罪。

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today procedure, we are going to see the detail of the defendant and his co-worker’s message to see whether they have an affair that beyond the co-worker relationship.

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解了。

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	The accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have child?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	Me and my husband have been married for 4 years. We didn’t have any children. 

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Where did you get married? In Taiwan? Or in your husband’s country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met in Taiwan 4 years ago. He came to Taiwan to teach Portuguese

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in a period between his jobs, is his job teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he is a Portuguese teacher, and after we get married, he still teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan, so it is not stable in his teaching hours. There is a great period between his jobs for 1 or 2 months. After a while, he seeks for a stable job, so he tried to teach English. However, English is not his mother tongue, so he seek for an advance degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mention that he seek for an advance degree. Do you mean that is a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No. Because he want to teach English in Taiwan, so the degree he need is an English teaching degree. He found a distance learning program in California. In that, he can have a distance learning in Taiwan, and he didn’t need to go to the America. After program, he can have the master degree, and he can teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship with he and his affair person?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They were co-workers in his cram-school. They are partnered with my husband.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know that they are having an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I just notice that my husband often find reason for extra works in the school. And I don’t know why- it is a school and he need to have extra work….At the begging, I didn’t suspect him. However, in a few time, I found he will have phone call in the house, and when he responses the phone call, he will get into the study room. So I tried to check his phone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	Did you see something strange in his phone

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	I found a phone in his phone book. So I check the message about that phone call, and I found there are many intimate messages.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even is the text it is okay…is the text no appropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it is the regular text, that okay. But he is married, why a married person have intimate messages with other woman in his phone? I have some evidence in the file of the court. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Exhibition 1 page 13, is this message from your phone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的這些是在我手機裡的訊息。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	I would like to ask some question about this message. The first message was sent by number 0958-532123 on 9:50 p.m. December 21, 2017. It is the “ I really miss you, my love.” What that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那封簡訊是我同事寄給我的，我記得當時我請了2天的假，所以他才發那一的簡訊給我，我的同事在美國讀書的所以思想比較開放，至於親愛的這個詞只是我們表達對朋友的稱呼。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the person who send the message was studied in foreign, so she has westernized and express her emotion open mind. So the word she send ‘my love’ didn’t mean nothing?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	是的，那只是對她所關心的人都有的稱呼。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	Then what about the previous one?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我所說的，她只是很關心我而已，因為我當時請了2天的假，而我們是互相之間的夥伴。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you meant that she sent the message because you just didn’t go to school for two days?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	對的就是那個意思，那簡訊沒什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent on the 11:55, December 29th 2017, the context is “I want you to be my side, when can we be truly together?’ What’s that mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳那簡訊給我是為了要告訴我要如何在中文句子中表達自己的情感。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So do you mean that she sent this message to help you with your homework? What was that meant?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我妻子所報告的，我正在攻讀一個碩士學位，而這個課程需要完成30學分，所以我自然會想要在平時所做練習。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you explain what’s your master degree study for?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的碩士學位是英語教學，它其中最主要包含了語文教學，那它也有部分是包含了文化以及語言能力的部分。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So your program is a TESOL but it is include some cultural and language competence course?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得我至少選修了3門有關於跨文化溝通的課程。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what’s the assignment of these cultural courses? 

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這些文化溝通的課程作業對每個人都不太一樣，以我為例，因為我在台灣，所以我的課程作業的目標是需要增進我的中文語言能力。因此我的作業多半是中英句子的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So do you meant that those assignment for translate sentences in Chinese and English….have relationship with your tend teaching English in Taiwan?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	沒錯，當然我也被要求了增進我的口說以及寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Then let’s focus on the sentence we mentioned. Is that your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的我記得當時我還不太理解一些中文句子的翻譯，所以我向我的同事請求幫忙，我把中文句子傳給她並希望她把它翻譯成英文句子給我看。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	Do you meant that she sent that message because you ask her for translate it in English, and that message was the answer of your homework?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	沒錯那封簡訊只是我作業的答案而已。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	That’s start in exhibition 1, page 14 to 16. Is all this message is for your assignment? I mean all the content of this message the answer of your homework?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	對的這些簡訊都來自幫我完成作業的人。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then what’s your plead for you have an affair with the other woman.

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我太太只是想太多了，我知道她對我目前分擔家計的能力不太滿意，而我也希望法院知道她從一開始就不太支持我攻讀這個碩士學位。她也不太願意對我的課程上有所幫助，所以我才只好找我的同事完成這些作業，所以我認為她應該為這件事情負責。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your explanation, you don’t have a happy marriage life between you and your wife? 

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	一開始我們相處得很愉快，但之後因為我的工作關係，因為我教葡萄牙文的關係，所以在台灣不太有穩定的工作時間，因此我的工作常常成了我們的爭吵議題，她不認為我真的盡了我的全力了而我也因此常常很受挫。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay. Let’s go back to your program of your master degree. When did it start? Did you finish your program?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2015年的秋天開始我的碩士課程的，這課程本來應該是要在2017年的5月結束的，但我沒有完成它，因為我必須在工作及學位間做選擇，而這碩士學位影響了我的工作。就像我說的，我妻子從來就不支持我，而我感到很孤獨很沮喪；來攻讀這個學位，因此我覺得我非常的疲倦。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mention that the program is set for 2 years. Why didn’t you finish that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成那些課堂作業，以及一些課程的必修。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So what is the last semester of your registration? 

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我最後註冊的一個學期是2017年的春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As your mention, your program is finished on May 2017. However, you continual connect with your co-worker. How did you explain that you have the assignment after you finished the program?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	或許我沒完成那個學位，但這不代表說我不想精進我的中文能力，我依然非常想增進我的中文能力，因此我找同事來做這些練習。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	You mean that even if didn’t finish that program, you still want to learn Chinese by yourself?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	沒錯，那就是我找我同事幫忙的原因。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the role of your colleague, co-worker is like your tutor, right?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是個家教，而是我真心的朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我原本想要的，但她拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you did not pay, why she response your answer in midnight when she is going to sleep? Is this relationship beyond your co-worker’s relationship?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	就像我所說的，她是位非常支持我的朋友

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Do you still teaching English in that school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的我還在那邊工作。

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is this colleague still works there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	null

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any person you want to ask, or some exhibition you want to show?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope to subpoena his colleague, 蓉兒黃, who works in 美而美 school. For the investigate the details, and background of those messages.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Accuser, did you need anything ant to investigate for?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the美而美school have took some action for my husband and蓉兒黃for their relationship. And I would like to hear the explanation of the school. 

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The situation now is your program has ended in May 2017, and you don’t have any reason to contact with your colleague in December. And your message often sent in 9 p.m. It is weird for your relationship.

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我並沒有任何法院需要調查的證據，就像我所說的，這些簡訊都只是我想用來增進中文能力的方法而已。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The court will have ask the details 4:30 p.m. June 24 2017…..

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白了。

zh-TW	了解

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	The prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the letter of indictment

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for an adultery case. The accuser’s name is Yu Han Wang. She accuses Edward who were in a cram school…She accuses because Edward not only has intimate message with his coworkers, but also find some reasons for working late in the cram school, also will have some tele-conferencing that is beyond their relationship of the coworkers. So, the accuser Yu Han Wang accuses Edward for adultery. The defendant, your wife sued you for adultery, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparation procedure, the court will focus on the intimate message and his coworkers. To understand whether it consists…constitute adultery case. Do you fully understand the procedure?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	Understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First I want to ask the accuser, how many years have you and your husband married? Do you have children?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have married for four years and we have none child.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	And did you married with your husband in Taiwan or at the broad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	I met my husband in Taiwan for years ago. He came here to teach Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the past four years, your husband’s job in Taiwan is teaching Portuguese?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	Before we met, he was a Portuguese teacher and after we married he is still teaching Portuguese. However, learning Portuguese is not popular in Taiwan so there are one or two months period between jobs that he didn’t have student to teach. In order to make the income more stable, he wants to learn English. However English is not his mother tongue so he spent more time on this language and study it… and seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You have mentioned he decided to seek an advanced degree, is that mean he wants to study a degree in Taiwan? 

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, he wants to teach English in Taiwan so the degree he gets is about the English teaching. He found an online learning which was located in the California USA, so he can use this distance learning to finish his degree. So after that he finished online-leaning he can get the master degree of the USA. He can find a job to teach English in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	What’s the relationship between the person he has an affair with?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	The cram school will have a Chinese teacher and a Western teacher and my husband and that girl are partners

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have an affair with each other?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, he often work late, so I asked him why did you have to work late in an English cram school? He replied that he has a Chinese partner and they have to communicate with each other to talk about their teaching. At first I have no doubt about him, but ….for the time goes…after he went home he will get some phones and he will not answer the phone in front of me, but instead he will go to the study room. After that I checked his cellphone.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	What did you see in the cellphone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	After I checked his cellphone, I found that there is a same number in the phone book, so after that I checked his message and found that he send message with same woman almost every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even they text with each other…it’s fine? Or the content is not proper?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	I also want it is not an appropriate text, but he was married but still send some intimate messages with that woman. I have provided some investigation messages in the file, maybe there are in the file.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Let’s look at the investigation page 13. It’s about the message. The defendant, please look at the message. Are the messages you send to others?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是地這些是我手機上的簡訊

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	And I want to ask some questions about the messages. The first message is sent at 9:50 on December twenty-first 2017, from the phone number 0958932123 to your cellphone. And the content of message is “I really miss you”. So what is this mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那封簡訊是我同事傳來的，那時候正好請…兩天沒有去上班，她是關心我，所以才傳這封簡訊，我的同事在美國受高等教育，她也是非常能接受新思想的人，至於說”my love”我的摯愛這個詞的話，是一種對關心的人表達的方式而已。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	So what you mean is that your college is educated so she was westernized…so her…so…she will be more open-minded toward relationship. So “my dear love” is just a kind of concerning about you?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	那句話就是對老朋友表達關心的方式

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	So how about the line?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就如同上面所述，她當時是非常擔心我，因為我們是工作上夥伴關係，她只是想要表達她的關心而已

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Since you have two days off the work, so she text you for…missing you to work each other and cooperate with each other and work, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	對~那就是我想表達的意思，簡訊內其實沒甚麼大不了的

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was at 11:55 at night. It is on December 29th ,2017. And it is from the same cellphone… number of the cellphone. The message is “I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” So what’s this mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳這封簡訊是要教我如何…用中文來表達…中文的一個作業

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you have mentioned that she texts you this message is just to help you with this assignment? What’s this mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我老婆在庭前所說，碩士學位是需要修滿30學分，除此之外還需要完成許多作業與題目

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	 So would you please explain first, what’s the content of your master degree? What did you learn in it?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我是先英語教學的碩士學位，她除了包含英語教學以外，還有關文化、有些語文能力的訓練

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So you have achieved the master degree of TESOL… and your leaning has included the cross-cultural communication, is that right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得三門課是有關文化與溝通的

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what’s the assignment of the course of culture and communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這門課的作業是因人而異的，舉一個例子，像我在台灣想成為英文老師，我是要展現對中文的能力，所以我的作業是以中英翻譯為主。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you have to approve your Chinese ability. Due to the assignment, you have to translate many sentences into Chinese? Right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，除此之外還需要潤飾口說與寫作能力

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Let’s go back to the context of the message. You said it’s your assignment?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的，那是我作業的一部分，中文有許多困難的字，對初學外國人來講，所以我請求同事幫我翻譯再把答案傳給我。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So what you have said is that you asked your colleges to translate sentences so she translated into then sended to you. Is this the situation at that time?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	簡訊的內容就只是我作業中的部分而已

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	So let’s look at page 14 to 16 about the investigation. The defendant, so know you can see all the messages. Are they all for the assignments? Is that right?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的這些簡訊都是為了尋求幫忙的內容

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So what’s your plea about your wife cused you having affair with colleague?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	對我認為我太太是想太多的，我也知道她可能認為我，對於支持這個機庭並不是那麼盡責，但當時我在完成碩士學位期間她也沒有給予任何幫助，因為她之前沒有給予任何幫助，所以我才會去尋求同事的幫忙，而她也要為此負責任…為這次的誤會負責任

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your explanation, you have not a very good relationship with your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	我們開始的婚姻其實還蠻美好的，後來變質的原因為我工作的緣故，我是教葡萄牙，但是工作並不是那麼穩定，後來由於工作的議題有許多的爭吵，她認為我沒有盡力…對於工作沒有盡力而為，但我其實有許多挫折與苦衷是沒有說出來的。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	So let’s go back to your master degree. When is your master degree? Has it ended? Have you gotten the master degree yet?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	這個碩士課程是在2015四月開始的，為期兩年，應該要在2017年的五月結束，然而我沒有完成碩士學位，因為當時兼職了…做了很多打工而沒有完成作業，就像我說的，我太太在碩士學位研習沒有給予任何的幫助，所以我覺得我是獨自一人奮鬥，奮鬥道非常的淚雨很大的挫折感。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You have mentioned the degree lasted for two years, and you didn’t finished, why is that?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成所有的作業，還有課堂上的特定要求

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	When was your last semester of your last registration? 

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我註冊最後一學期是2017年春天

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you have mentioned, your last semester of course ended at 2017, so it is no reason that you’ll have assignment after the semester, and your colleagues still send you the translation of the assignment seven months after your last semester?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	並不是我沒有完成學位就代表我不想精進中文的能力，在課程之後我仍然自學中文。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So what you mean is that even you didn’t get master degree, you still want to approve your Chinese ability, so you continue learning, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，這就是我請同事幫助我的原因

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So your colleagues played a role like a tutor?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不只是我的家教也是非常好的朋友

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay for her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	原本想要付錢給她，但她拒絕了

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	So if you did not pay her the salaries，why did she have to send you messages at midnight? And this behavior is beyond co-worker’s relationship.

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這就是我之前說她是非常持我的朋友，她花費自己的時間讓我英文更好

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Did you teach English at that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的我還是在那邊教書

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Is this colleagues work there also?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	她還在那邊工作，但我們已經不是合作得關係

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have to…any person to subpoena or investigate any…

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I want to subpoena the colleagues of named Ron Er Huang and as a witness to tell the court what’s the purpose of the texts and explain the texts as well.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	Accuser, do you have anything to investigate, the court may help you?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has put some actions about the relationship between two people, and also persuade the person to resign her job. So I want to investigate this evidence to prove it’s right or not.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have anything to investigate the court may help you? As your master degree ended at 2016, so that’s an excuse of your interaction with your colleagues, by sending texts mostly after nine pm, that is doubtable… Do you want to provide any evidence to prove that…your…you are not guilty. 

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	對於庭上，我沒有想要庭上調查的事項，我們的關係真的是…很一般，我只是想要增進中文能力，並持續學中文而已

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next court is set at 16:30 on April, June 22nd 2018, for asking the witness of the procedure. And all of you, the defendant, the accuser have to participate the court and you can hire a lawyer. Do you fully understand?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我明白

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	告知權利義務
en-US	As the defendant you have the following rights:

zh-TW	1.你有權保持緘默，毋需違背意志做任何陳述。
en-US	First, you have the right to remain silent and do not have to make any statement against your will.

zh-TW	3.你有權請法院調查任何對你有利的證據。
en-US	Third, you have the right to ask the court to investigate any evidence which may help you with your case.

zh-TW	被告是否了解以上權利？
en-US	Do you fully understand your rights?

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我知道我了解

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor please describe the fact of the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	As stated on the indictment.

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the adultery case. The defendant’s wife Yu-Hen Wang is intend to accuse his..her husband because she finds in her husband cell phone that there were some intimate messages with her…his coworker. And that the accuser finds that her husband often come back home late from work, contacting with his coworker during midnight and the content of the conversation has gone beyond merely coworker relationship. The defendant, your wife has suspected that you have commit the crime of adultery. What is your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	無罪答辯，當然

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory procedure, we are going to ask the defendant the detail of his conversation with his coworker. So that we could determine  whether the defendant has committed the crime of adultery.

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	我了解

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, the accuser, how long have you been married with your husband? Do you have any kids?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	Me and my husband have been married for 4 years. We do not have any children.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	Does you… do you marry with your husband in Taiwan? Or do you marry with your husband in foreign country?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met 4 years age in Taiwan. He came to Taiwan primarily for teaching Portuguese.

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So, in the previous years, his main job is teaching Portuguese, right?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we first met, he was a Portuguese teacher, after we got married, he is still teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese is not a popular language in Taiwan. There are not many students waiting to learn Portuguese. So, his teaching hours is not that stable. Sometimes he wouldn’t have any classes for 1 or 2 months. After a while, he hoped that he could have a stable income. So he would like to teach English. However, English is not her native language. So he decides to go on further education and seeks for an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	You just mentioned he would like to seek for an advanced degree. Do you mean that he would like to study a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he would like to teach English in Taiwan, so he would need to have a TESOL degree. He found a distanced learning program in California, so he do not have to go to United States to earn a degree. After the online program, he could receive a master degree and he planned that after earning the degree, he could find a teaching job in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	Then, what’s his relationship with this so-called adultery…adultery person?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They were colleague in cram school. Because in that cram school, they offer teacher both in Chinese and foreign country. They are partners. 

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How do you know that they are committing adultery?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I discoverer that my husband start to work late and I ask him why he work late so often. It’s merely a cram school. He said that because he has to partner with the Chinese teacher, there are a lot of issues for them to communicate about. In the beginning, I don’t have any doubts on him. However, after a while, I discovered that when he arrived home, there are a lot of phone calls. And he always receive the phone calls in a private space such as his study room. And do not want me to know what he is talking about. So that I begin to suspect him.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So, do you see any unusual messages in the phone?

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	There is a phone number that keep coming up all the time in his dialing record. And then I check his message box, I discovered that he has been messaging with the same girl all the time.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even is just texting… text message, it’s nothing. Are the text content inappropriate?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	If it’s just regular texting, how come the text message is so intimate? Why a married person would text like that? I have submitted the text log to the court. I believe the contents are already in the folder.

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Present Exhibit 1 page 13. The defendant, is this the message in your phone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這些是在我手機裡的訊息。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Then, I would like to ask some questions regarding these messages. The first message come from 9:50 P.M. 12/21, 2017 from the phone number 0958932123. The content of the message is “I really miss you, my love.” What does that even mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那封簡訊是我同事傳給我的。我記得那時我請了兩天的假，因為她有點擔心，才傳了那樣的簡訊，我的同事在美國受教育，他思想比較開放，而至於”親愛的”這個詞呢，只是我們表達我們對於我們關心的人的一種方法。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because your coworker is more westernize so that she is more open-minded so that she expressed her emotion in that way. The word “my love” does not have any special meaning. 

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	對的，這是好朋友之間或者是對關心的人所表達的一種方法。

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	Then, what about the previous sentence?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，他只是比較擔心我而已，因為我當時請了兩天的假，而我們也是工作中非常要好的同事。

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that because you just took two day off and that she express her concern to you on the work?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	對的，那就是情境。這個簡訊沒有什麼大不了的。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message came from 11:55 P.M. 12/29 2017 from the same message, same cell phone, with the same number. The content is “ I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?” What was that mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	他傳這個簡訊是告訴我如何用中文表達這樣的訊息。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you mean that she sent this message is to help you with your own assignment. What does that mean?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	正如我妻子所提到的，我正在修讀碩士學位，這個課程需要我完成30個學分，那麼當然的，這其中就包含了一些作業。

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you please explain what your master degree is about?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程主要是跟英語教學有關，其中包含了語文教學還有部分是跟文化以及語言能力。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So, you are study for TESOL program, and that the program constituted with some culture related courses?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得我至少是有三門課是和跨文化及溝通有關的。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	What are the assignment for these so-called culture and communication courses?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	這些文化溝通的課程的作業會依個人而定，像比方說，因為我在台灣所以我的課程會需要我能擁有良好的中文能力。因此，我的課程有很多跟作業有很多是關於中文英文句子之間的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So, do you mean that your course require you to have some Chinese ability so that you have the assignment of translating Chinese and English. Is that right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	是的，沒有錯，當然，我也被要求要有精進我的口說以及聽力還有寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	Then, let’s go back to that sentence. You say this is your assignment, right?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	是的沒有錯。那個句子是我的作業。我記得我當時還不斷的理解一些中文字句的翻譯，所以我向我的同事請教。畢竟中文和英文的結構以及字非常不一樣。我把中文的句子傳給他，並且希望他能幫我把這個句子翻譯成英文。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So do you...did you mean that you send the Chinese sentence to your coworker and the coworker help you translate it in English and send it to you? So the message is just only for homework. Is that right?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	是的，那個訊息僅僅是我作業的答案。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	Ok. Then let’s go to Exhibit one, page fourteen to sixteen. So, are these all messages for your homework? Please take a look.

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的，這些所有簡訊都是為了幫助我完成我的作業。

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	Then, what’s your explanation toward your wife’s claim of you having an affair?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我的太太只是想太多了，我知道他對我不能協助分擔家計感到不滿。而我希望法院可以知道，他從一開始就不支持我工讀我的碩士學位。因為他不支持我，所以我才必須問我同事這些課程上的問題。所以我覺得，這個整起誤會的責任在他身上而不是我。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your statement, there are some issue between your relationship with your wife?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	一開始我們相處得非常好，但之後因為我的工作遇到了一些問題，在台灣葡萄牙語的教學時間並不是非常穩定。因此我們的工作造成了我們之間一些爭吵的原因。他不認為我有付出足夠的努力來找工作。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	OK. Let’s go back to your master degree program. So do you finish the program? Have you received the degree yet?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我是在2015年的秋天開始了這個課程。這個課程為時兩年，我應該在2017年的五月取得了我的學位，但是我並沒有完成我的學位。因為我必須時常做兼職工作。因此這影響了我的我的讀書時間。就像我說的，我妻子並不支持我攻讀這個學位，我只能孤身一人的攻讀個學位，漸漸的我感到非常的勞累及挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mentioned that the program is for two yearlong but you did not finish the program. Why...why did you do not complete your program

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我無法完成所有的課堂作業以及一些課程的畢業要求。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So what… What’s your last registration date?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我最後註冊的時間是2017年春天。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	As you stated, the last...the program finish on May 2017; however, you continue have texted message with your coworker. What do you explain that?

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	我結束了我的課程，並不代表我放棄精進我的中文能力，我仍然非常想精進我的中文能力，所以我才持續的傳送這些訊息。

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	Are you saying that even you did not finish the program, you still want to enhance your Chinese ability?

en-US	Yes, that’s why I asked my colleague for help
zh-TW	是的，因此我才會尋求我同事的協助。

zh-TW	那你的這位同事，她所扮演的角色就像你的家教囉？
en-US	So the role of your colleague is like your tutor, correct?

en-US	She has been not only a tutor but also a true friend.
zh-TW	她不僅僅是我的家教，而且還是我一個好朋友。

zh-TW	你有付錢給她嗎
en-US	Did you pay her?

en-US	No, I offered to pay her but she declined.
zh-TW	沒有，我原本想要付錢給他，但是他拒絕了。

zh-TW	如果你沒有付錢給她，她為什麼要在半夜應該就寢的時候還不辭辛勞的發簡訊回答你的問題呢？這是不是已經超過了一個同事應該做的事情？
en-US	If you did not pay her, then how come she reply your message in the middle of night? Does that has formed a relationship beyond merely coworker?

en-US	That’s why I said she was a very supportive friend. She was using her own time to help me learn Chinese.
zh-TW	這就是為什麼我說他是一個非常支持我的朋友，他用他自己的時間來協助我學習中文。

zh-TW	你現在還有在那家補習班教英文嗎？
en-US	Are you still teaching in that cram school?

en-US	Yes, I am still working there. 
zh-TW	是的我仍然在那裏工作

zh-TW	那這位同事也還在那裏服務嗎？
en-US	Does this colleague still working there?

en-US	She is also still working there but we do not team up any more.
zh-TW	是的她仍然在那裏工作，但我們不再是工作上的搭檔

zh-TW	請問檢察官，有沒有進一步要傳喚的證人或是調查事證？
en-US	The prosecutor, do you have any evidence would like to investigate or would like to summon any other witness?

zh-TW	希望能夠傳訊被告的同事，也就是任職美而美補習班的黃蓉兒以證人身分到庭，說明他與被告之間的關係，以及那些簡訊的撰寫背景及目的。
en-US	I hope that we could summon the defendant’s colleague 蓉兒黃 to understand what’s her relationship with the defendant, and the content of the message.

zh-TW	請問告訴人有沒有任何希望本庭代為調查的事證？
en-US	The accuser, do you have any other evidence that you would like the court to help you investigate?

zh-TW	我聽說美而美補習班針對他們兩個人的關係，有採取一些行動。其中更有試圖說服該女黃蓉兒離職一事，不知道能不能向那個補習班求證這件事情。
en-US	I heard that the cram school has taken some actions between the relationships of my husband and 蓉兒黃. They even ask 蓉兒華 to leave her job. I would like the court to help me investigate whether this is true or not.

zh-TW	那請問被告，有沒有任何希望法庭為你調查的事證？現在的情況是，你的碩士學位早就已經在中華民國106年5月就已結束，實在沒有理由以做作業為藉口來解釋你跟黃蓉兒的簡訊互動，尤其是你們的簡訊互動大多在晚上九點鐘以後進行，實在起人疑竇，你有沒有任何證據可以幫助你的案情呢？
en-US	The defendant, do you have any evidence that would like the court to help you investigate to? The situation now is that you have finished your master program in May 2017. So that it is highly unlikely that you ask your colleague to help you with your assignment. And also the text message were sent during midnight, this raise suspicious… a suspicion on your relationship with your coworker.

en-US	I cannot think of any evidence that the court can investigate on my behalf. As I said, the reason for the communication between my colleague and myself was very simple. I only wanted to improve my language ability and continue to learn Chinese.
zh-TW	我並沒有任何證據希望法庭為我調查，就如我所說的，我和我的同事只是好朋友，這些簡訊只是我為了精進我的中文所傳送。

zh-TW	那本庭訂中華民國107年6月24日下午4點30分進行證人詰問程序，請告訴人、被告都要到庭，如果有必要，雙方都可以請辯護人，明白嗎？
en-US	The next proceeding is set on June 24th 2018 4:30 P.M. The defendant and the accuser must come to the court. And if necessary, the defendant and the accuser could bring their own lawyer to the court. Do you understand?

zh-TW	 我明白。
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand, too.
zh-TW	我也明白

zh-TW	今為 刑事庭 審易字2345號 通姦案件之準備程序

zh-TW	是，我瞭解了

zh-TW	請檢察官簡述起訴要旨。
en-US	Prosecutor, please state the crime.

zh-TW	如起訴書所載。
en-US	Same as the indictment

zh-TW	今天我們進行外遇通姦案件之準備程序。告訴人王宇涵提起這次的訴訟案件，主要是因為她的先生Edward Takayashi跟所任職之補習班同事從往過密，且告訴人在其先生的手機簡訊記錄中查到一些親密的訊息，再加上被告常常會藉故加班，或是深夜與其同事黃蓉兒進行視訊或其他方式之交談，因告訴人所蒐集之通訊內容已超過同事情誼，故提起此告訴。被告，你太太懷疑你有外遇，要告你通姦罪，你作何辯解？
en-US	Today we are here for the preparatory case of an adultery case. The accuser, Wang Yu Han. She filed the sue against the defendant, Edward Takayashi. The defendant was charged with having an intimate message with his employee in the cram school. And the accuser also found some intimate message through his cellphone while the defendant was having a night shift and also have a video tele-conferencing with ZonER- Huang. The defendant, you are charged by your wife of an adultery, what’s your plea?

en-US	Not guilty, of course.
zh-TW	當然無罪啊

zh-TW	在今天的準備程序中，主要程序為詢問被告與其同事之通訊細節，以釐清是否被告與其同事實有外遇情事，足以構成通姦罪。雙方明白程序嗎？
en-US	In today’s preparatory case, we are here to discuss….talk about the detail about the defendant and his employee of the…. We are having to discuss the.. whether the person has an affair with the others. Do you two understand?

zh-TW	我明白
en-US	I understand.

en-US	I understand.
zh-TW	是我瞭解了.

zh-TW	先請問告訴人，妳跟妳先生結婚多久了？有小孩嗎？
en-US	First, the accuser, do you have the child with your husband?

zh-TW	我跟我先生已經結婚四年了，我們沒有小孩。
en-US	We have married for four years. But we don’t have the child.

zh-TW	那妳跟妳先生是在台灣結婚的嗎？還是在國外結婚的
en-US	So, did you marry your husband in Taiwan, or abroad?

zh-TW	我跟我先生是在台灣認識的，四年前他剛來台灣，主要想要教葡萄牙文。
en-US	We met each other in Taiwan. Four years ago, my husband came to Taiwan for teaching Portuguese. 

zh-TW	那過去幾年，他在台灣的工作都是教葡萄牙文嗎？
en-US	So in the past years, does your husband teach Portuguese as his work?

zh-TW	我們剛開始認識的時候，他是一位葡萄牙文老師，在我們結婚之後，他還有繼續教葡萄牙文，可是葡萄牙文在台灣並不是一個有很多人學的語言，所以他的授課時數一直很不穩定，有時候甚至一兩個月的課程都會是空窗期，後來因為希望能夠讓收入比較穩定，他想要開始教英文，可是因為他的母語並不是英文，所以他決定要去進修。
en-US	When we met the first time, he was a Portuguese teacher. And he has keep teaching Portuguese. However, Portuguese isn’t a popular language in Taiwan, and…so the teaching hours are usually short, and there are periods between jobs. In order to earn a stable living, he started to learn English in Taiwan, since his mother tongue isn’t English, so he choose to seek an advanced degree.

zh-TW	你剛剛講到他決定要進修，是在台灣念一個學位嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that he wants to earn a degree in Taiwan? And get a degree in Taiwan?

zh-TW	不是，因為他希望能夠在台灣教英文，所以必須取得的學位是關於英語教學的。他在網路上找到了一個美國加州所提供的遠距教學課程，讓他可以不用人去美國，都可以用函授的方式，完成課程的要求，這樣子在完成所有的學分之後，就可以取得碩士學位。他的計畫是，透過這樣子的一個美國學位，能夠在台灣找到英文教師的工作。
en-US	No, because he wants to teach English. So the degree he gets is to …for English teaching. My husband found…that..found a distance learning program in California, it’s an online learning, he doesn’t need to go to there for learning. After he gets all the credits, then he can get a master degree. What he is planning is to have an American degree, so that he can has a qualification for English teaching in Taiwan.

zh-TW	那他跟這次所謂的外遇對象，是什麼樣的關係呢？
en-US	So, what the relationship between the person he has an affair with this time?

zh-TW	他們是補習班的同事。那個補習班有安排所謂的中師跟外師搭檔教學。那個女的就是他班上的中師。
en-US	They are the co-workers in the cram school, there will be a Chinese teacher and a foreign teacher, so they can cooperate with each other in the… in class. The person he has an affair with was a Chinese teacher.

zh-TW	你怎麼會知道他們有外遇呢？
en-US	How did you know they have an affair?

zh-TW	一開始我只是注意到我先生常常會留在學校加班，我問過他好幾次，只不過是個美語補習班，有什麼好加班的？他告訴我說，因為要和中師搭檔教學，有很多需要溝通的地方。一開始我真的沒有懷疑他，可是我後來發現，他常常會在回家之後，接到一些電話，而接到電話的時候，都不會在我面前講，還會特地到書房去講。這讓我開始有所懷疑。所以我就查看了他的手機。
en-US	At first, I was suspecting and ask him why he had to have a night shift after the school? Because it’s just an American cram school, and he has to cooperate with the Chinese teacher, so they had to have the further communication on teaching. At first, I didn’t suspect that… anything about him, but ….when he was having a phone call in….at home, he wouldn’t talk in front me, but he choose to talk through the phone in his… study room….instead.

zh-TW	在手機中你看到什麼不尋常的嗎？
en-US	So did you found anything strange in his cellphone? 

zh-TW	他的通訊紀錄中常常看到同一個電話號碼，所以我很好奇的又去查他的簡訊，查了之後才發現他跟一個女的幾乎每天都通簡訊。
en-US	And I checked through his phone book, and I saw there was a same number, then I checked his phone message, and I found that he was messaging with a girl he chatted every day.

zh-TW	就算是發簡訊，也還好吧？難道內容很不恰當嗎？
en-US	Even though…. It was a…. Even though, texting messages is not..doesn’t have anything wrong or are there any something weird during the communication?

zh-TW	如果只是普通的簡訊也就罷了，可是他是一個已婚的人。怎麼會讓對方發一些很親密的字句呢。之前我有提供一些他們的簡訊內容給法院，應該都在卷夾裡面了。
en-US	So it’s just a regular message, but however there are..they have some intimate messages between each other, and I have files some intimate messages to the court. Maybe it’s inside the file already. 

zh-TW	提示偵卷(一)第13頁。這邊裡面有幾通簡訊內容，請被告看一下。請問這是你手機上的簡訊內容嗎？
en-US	Please show the exhibit 1 of Page 13. The defendant, please see the content, are these the one on your phone?

en-US	Yes, these were the messages on my cell phone.
zh-TW	是的，這是我手機裡的訊息內容。

zh-TW	那我現在要針對這幾個內容跟你問一下，第一封是在中華民國106年12月21日21點50分，由手機0958-932123發送到你手機上的簡訊，內容是「I really miss you, my love」，請問這是什麼意思？
en-US	Then, I will ask you some questions with these messages. The first message, it was sent at 9:50, December 21st, 2017, the phone number was 0958932123. It was sent to your… the message was sent to your cellphone, and it was written “I really miss you very much”, 我非常想念妳。….親愛的，我非常想念妳。 what does that mean?

en-US	Well, it’s from a colleague of mine. I remember, at that time, I took two days off from work. She was a bit concerned or worried. That’s why she sent me that message. My colleague was educated in the US and she is very open-minded. That’s the way she talked and expressed herself. As to “my love,” that is just a way we call the people we care.
zh-TW	那是我同事…我同事發給我的，那天我請兩天的假，那是我朋友非常緊張有焦慮的事情。那是我…她是在美國接受教育的，所以她是一個非常開放，然後她思想開放，很勇於表達她自己想法的人，那封訊息內容，I really miss you so much, my love. 那只是她.. 我們互相表達關愛的方式。

zh-TW	你是說，這個發信人因為之前在國外待過所以思想比較西化，對情感的表達也比較開放一點，所以「我的愛」並沒有什麼特別的意思，是嗎？
en-US	Do you mean that the girl was educated in foreign country? So she is westernized, and what she expressed is open-minded, and the message” I really miss you so much” is how she expressed her care?

en-US	No, that is a very common expression between good friends or friends who care a lot for each other.
zh-TW	對阿。那是朋友之間表達關心的方式。或是更好朋友之間互相表達的關心

zh-TW	那她前面那句呢？
en-US	So how about the previous message?

en-US	As I said, she was worried about me. We are partners at work. When I was away for two days, she naturally missed me. 
zh-TW	就像我說的，她是來….她是傳簡訊來問我東西。我那天請兩天假，所以她有點想念我

zh-TW	你的意思是，對方只是因為你兩天沒有上班，才發這樣的簡訊表達說因為沒有你上課的輔助，所以她很想你？就只是這樣子嗎？
en-US	So you mean that …since you have seem just drop two days from your work, and she messaged you that she really missed you a lot. Which means she wanted you a help for her, is that right?

en-US	Yes, that was the context. The message was no big deal.
zh-TW	是的，這就是那個..這內容所要表達的。那並沒有什麼。

zh-TW	那第二封簡訊，是在中華民國106年12月29日23點55分，也是由同一個人的手機發送給你，訊息內容是「I want you by my side, when can we be truly together?」，請問這句話是什麼意思，為什麼會有這樣的內容呢？
en-US	The second message was sent at 23:55. December 29th, 2017. And it was sent by the same person. The message was written” 我想要你在我旁邊，我們什麼時候可以在一起？” What does that mean?

en-US	She wrote me that message to tell me how to express a Chinese sentence in my assignment.
zh-TW	她傳的那則簡訊，是要問我說要怎麼在中文怎麼表達豐富的情感。

zh-TW	你是說對方會發這個簡訊給你，是為了幫助你做作業嗎？這是什麼意思？
en-US	So you mean that she sent you the message just for…just asking help with her work?

en-US	As my wife has informed the court, I was attending a Master’s program. In that program, I was required to complete 30 credits before I could receive my degree. Naturally, I needed to complete some assignments and exercises.
zh-TW	就像我之前跟法庭所說的，我現在有那個碩士學位要修，而且有30學分去完成這個學位。正常來說，我有功課，我一定有功課要做，所以這就是我當時我要所提問的問題

zh-TW	先請你解釋一下，你的碩士學位到底在念什麼？
en-US	Can you further explain, what are you studying in your Master program?

en-US	My program was TESOL. In that program, some of the courses were related to English teaching and others were related to culture and language competence.
zh-TW	我的課程是屬於英語教學，除了英語的教學之外，還有那個…文化上跟語言能力的課程。

zh-TW	所以你拿的是英語教學碩士，可是裡面有一些文化溝通的課程，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you are getting a mater degree for TESOL, and there are some cultural communication inside the course right?

en-US	Yes, I remember at least three courses were related to culture and communication.
zh-TW	是的，我記得有至少三門課程是有關文化溝通的課程。

zh-TW	那這種所謂的文化溝通課程，都給什麼樣的作業呢？
en-US	So what are the assignments for the cultural and communication?

en-US	The assignments for the culture and communication courses can be different for every student. Take myself for example. I am in Taiwan and try to seek a teaching position as an English teacher. To reach this goal and prove my competence, I have to show that I have a good command of Chinese. Therefore, many of my assignments were about Chinese-English sentence translation.
zh-TW	文化溝通不只是就是增加我的經驗之外，還有爭取教學的工作在台灣，除了當一個老師要有一個目標之外，還要一個有語言能力在中文上。所以我的作業有很多是有關中英上的翻譯。

zh-TW	你是說因為你計畫在台灣教英文，所以這個碩士課程的內容就要求你證明自己有一定的中文能力。所以你必須完成課程中所給的一些作業，作業的練習就是翻譯句子，是這樣的嗎？
en-US	So you mean that you want to…you plan to teach English in Taiwan, but you have to get a master degree, and there are courses about Chinese. So the assignments you are assigned are translating the sentences right? In Chinese and English right?

en-US	True. Of course, I was also required to sharpen my speaking and writing skills.
zh-TW	沒錯，我同時還要精進我的口說跟寫作能力。

zh-TW	好，那再回到我們剛剛那句話。你說這是你的作業嗎？
en-US	So that go back to the words, are these your assignments?

en-US	Yes, I remember that sentence. When I got the Chinese sentences, I didn’t know how to say them in English. You know, some Chinese words can be very difficult for foreigners to recognize. I needed some help so I asked my colleague to help me. I told her to translate that sentence for me and sent me the answer.
zh-TW	對的。那的確是我的，我之前在學中文所翻譯到的句子。你知道吧，對外國人來說，有些中文句子的確很難分辨。那剛好那個句子我就請我同事翻成中文給我看….請她翻成英文給我看。然後再請她傳送我過來。

zh-TW	你的意思就是說，因為你問了你同事那一句中文，她就把答案打成英文發簡訊給你，這就是當時的情況嗎？也就是說，這封簡訊只是作業的解答嗎？
en-US	So you mean that ask your colleague to send the message into English to you. And those sentences of messages in English was just your assignments?

en-US	That message was only the answer to my homework.
zh-TW	那句話就只是我作業中的一個中文。

zh-TW	那再提示偵卷(一)第14到16頁數的所有簡訊內容，這些請你看一下，都是你因為要做作業，尋求對方幫助，對方才發給你的簡訊嗎？
en-US	So the defendant, please see the Exhibit 1, P.14-16. As we see the message context Are these all context were the assignments was for seeking help with your homework?

en-US	Yes, all these messages were for the same purpose of completing my assignments.
zh-TW	是的。這些都是我要拿來做功課做作業用的

zh-TW	那針對你太太說，你跟你的同事有外遇一事，你有何解釋？
en-US	So, what’s your explanation about the… about your wife filing the sue against you for…you are having an affair with other?

en-US	My wife really thinks too much of this matter. I know she is not satisfied with my ability of supporting the family. I want the court to know that she, from the very beginning of my study, has never shown any support. She was not willing to help me complete my degree. If she had been a bit more supportive, I would not have asked my colleague to help me. I think she should be blamed for this whole misunderstanding.
zh-TW	我覺得太太真的有點對此太焦慮了。我知道她其實並沒有對我感到對我照顧這個家庭感到很滿意，從我一開始要唸碩士學位的時候，她就沒有支持我。如果在她一開始支持我的攻讀進修的話，我就不需要尋求我同事的幫忙了。所以她應該要為這一整件的誤會付起最大的責任吧。

zh-TW	根據你的說法，你們夫妻之間似乎有些相處不愉快的情況？
en-US	According to your words, there seem to be some dis….between your both?

en-US	At the beginning of our marriage, we did have some good time. But the problem is my employment. I tried teaching Portuguese in Taiwan but could not get stable teaching hours. Then my job became the issue between the two of us. We fought from time to time over this issue. She didn’t believe that I have tried my best, and I have no way to let her understand my frustration and the difficult situation I have faced.
zh-TW	一開始我跟我太太結婚其實相處蠻愉快的，但問題出現在我要開始找工作，因為我當時要教葡萄牙文，但是我並沒有辦法拿到任何授課時數。所以因為這樣子我已經跟我太太吵了很多次了。她就是不相信我在這教學上做的努力，她也不知道我其實在教學上面臨了許多的挫折。

zh-TW	好，那回到你剛剛所講的碩士課程。請問你的碩士課程是什麼時候開始的，結束了嗎？你拿到學位了嗎？
en-US	Okay, let’s go back to your master course. Are you finish with your courses, or still keep going?

en-US	I first started the program in fall 2015. It was a two-year program. I should have finished the program in May 2017. I didn’t finish the program because I was working part-time and didn’t get enough time to do my course assignments. Like I said, my wife has never been very supportive. I felt that I was pursuing the degree all alone by myself. I became too tired and too frustrated.
zh-TW	我從2015年的秋天開始進行我兩年制的課程。原計畫是訂定在 2017年五月完成我碩士學位。但是因為我的打工因素，還有我作業沒有辦法完成。所以我就沒有拿到碩士學位。就像我說的，我太太並沒有支持我，我感覺像我自己一個人在追求這個學位，我真的感到很累也感到非常的挫折。

zh-TW	你是說這個課程原來是兩年期的，可是你最後沒有完成。為什麼呢？
en-US	You mean that the courses was for two-year program, but you didn’t finish. Why?

en-US	I couldn’t finish all the course assignments and also the course requirement.
zh-TW	我沒有辦法完成所有課程的功課。那還有一些課程的必修我也沒有辦法完成。

zh-TW	那你註冊在學的最後一個學期，到什麼時候為止？
en-US	So, what is your finish date for the registering your…courses?

en-US	The last semester of my registration was spring 2017.
zh-TW	我註冊在學的最後一個學期是在2017春天的時候。

zh-TW	如果誠如你所述，你最後一個學期的結束日期是中華民國106年5月，那麼合理推斷在那個學期之後，你就不會有任何的作業了。但是你與同事之間的簡訊聯絡卻一直到課程結束後七個月都還在進行。這是為什麼呢？
en-US	Like you said, you should finish your courses on May, 2017. And there will be no assignments for your courses. However, you have been texting messages with your colleagues for seven months after you finish your courses.

en-US	Well, I might not have finished that program but it doesn’t mean I didn’t want to improve my language ability. Even when I failed the program, I still wanted to improve my Chinese ability, so I continued to study on my own.
zh-TW	就算我今天沒有完成我的課程。我還是想要增加我的…精進我的中文能力。所以我就還是有持續自己在自學，然後就都會詢問有中文上的困

zh-TW	你的意思是，儘管你沒有完成那個碩士課程，你還是想要不斷的學中文，讓你的中文更加流利，是嗎？
en-US	So you mean that even though you didn’t finish your Chinese courses, you still want to enhance your Chinese ability, is that right?
